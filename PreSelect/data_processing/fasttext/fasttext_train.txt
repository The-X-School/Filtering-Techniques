Return to the Home Page  There are currently 13 Modules in Mathematics, all authored by Steven Roman. The titles are listed below, followed by a brief description of each, with tables of contents. Click on a title to see the description, or simply use the navigation keys to browse the entire list.  Third Edition, 93 pages, ISBN 1-878015-20-6  An elementary discussion of how mathematics may be used in the social sciences. Requires only basic arithmetic skills. Chapter 1 contains a discussion of how to form a group ranking of products, based on a set of individual rankings. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the famous Arrow Impossibility Theorem. Chapter 2 is devoted to measuring an individual's power, or influence, in a group setting. For instance, how much more power does a permanent member of the U.N. security council have than a temporary member? Chapter 3 contains a discussion of various methods for apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives—a very important contemporary political problem. The final section gives a fascinating historical perspective on this 200 year old problem.  Third Edition, 68 pages, ISBN 1-878015-21-4  A survey of the contemporary topic of codes and coding. Prerequisites are minimal, since all of the necessary mathematics is developed in the module. Chapter 1 contains a discussion of the ubiquitous check digit codes that are used for error detection, and can be found in a wide variety of common circumstances, such as Universal Product Codes (Bar Codes), credit card numbers, bank check numbers, driver's licence numbers and ISBN's. We compare various commonly used methods and show which ones work best for detecting errors. Chapter 2 contains a discussion of the most famous code of all — the Hamming code for error correction. The final chapter discusses the Huffman coding scheme, which is used to encode data for space saving purposes (rather than for error detection or correction).  Third Edition, 54 pages, ISBN 1-878015-19-2  This module requires no special mathematical background. Its aim is to acquaint the student with the basics of symbolic logic, such as how to correctly use DeMorgan's Laws, what the difference is between a conditional statement and its converse and how to recognize when an argument is logically valid. The module concludes with a brief discussion of how logic can be used to design circuits.  Second Edition, 66 pages, ISBN 1-878015-23-0  Prerequisites are intermediate algebra. The goals of this module are to introduce the basic terminology related to interest, loans, leases and bonds; to show how various quantities, such as the monthly payments on a loan, can be computed using mathematical formulas; and to show how business calculators are designed to make these computations easier. Examples are done using a scientific calculator, the TI BA II Plus and the HP 10B. This module would make a nice supplement to a course in business calculus.  Third Edition, 42 pages, ISBN 1-878015-16-8  An introduction to the fascinating field of secret messages, requiring no formal mathematical prerequisites for the first chapter, and an acquaintance with exponents for the second chapter. Chapter 1 describes some traditional, pre World War 2 methods for encoding messages. In Chapter 2, the author discusses one of the most used contemporary methods for encoding — the RSA method. At present, this method is believed to be secure, but may prove otherwise if efficient methods for factoring large numbers are ever discovered!  Fourth Edition, 49 pages, ISBN 1-878015-22-2  This module shows how exponents and logarithms play a role in the processes of growth and decay. Prerequisites are intermediate algebra. After a short review of logarithms, there follows a discussion of compound interest. The next section is devoted to the time value of money, including how to compute the payments on an auto loan or home mortgage. Then comes a discussion of famous logarithmic scales, such as the Richter scale. The final section concerns the exponential growth of organisms and the decay of radioactive substances.  Second Edition, 52 pages, ISBN 1-878015-26-5  Each chapter of this module is independent of the others, and contains a different topic in mathematics. The only prerequisite is intermediate algebra. This module would make a nice supplement to a precalculus course.  126 pages, ISBN 1-878015-10-9  The first two chapters of a standard college algebra book, this module is designed for self-study and as a supplement to a calculus course for those students who need a little review or reference in algebra.

__label__0 Contents of the Mathematics Placement Test  Since 1978, UW system faculty and Wisconsin high school teachers have been collaborating to develop a test for placing incoming students into college Mathematics courses. The current test includes four components: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. These components are available for each UW System campus to use according to its individual needs and resources. Each campus determines the appropriate scores for entry into specific courses. The purpose of this brochure is to introduce you to the test, describe the rationale behind its creation, and outline future plans for its continued development.  Background and Purpose of the Test  In 1978, following the publication of the UW System Basic Skills Task Force Report, members of Mathematics Department Faculties from UW System institutions met in Madison to discuss common entry-level curriculum problems. One problem most departments shared was how to effectively place incoming freshmen into an appropriate mathematics course. Placement procedures and tests varied from campus to campus and it seemed that some consistency was desirable. The decision was made to develop a System-wide test for placement into an introductory mathematics curriculum.  The committee that would begin this task would consist of representatives from any UW System Mathematics Department that chose to participate. The departments would select their representatives and participation would be strictly voluntary.  The first step in the project was to carefully analyze each of the individual curricula in the System and write a detailed set of prerequisite objectives for all courses prior to calculus. After this list was approved by all campuses, the committee began developing test items on the skills identified in their test objectives. Through a series of pilot administrations at area high schools and UW campuses, the committee obtained valuable information about how the individual items performed, and gained important insights into item writing strategies and techniques. Many items were refined or corrected, as necessary, and repiloted in an effort to improve their ability to distinguish between students with different levels of mathematical preparedness. After a sufficient number of high quality items had been developed, they were assembled into a complete test. The first operational form of the Mathematics Placement Test was administered in 1984.  Placement into college courses is the sole purpose of this test. The experienced teacher will quickly realize that many skills which are taught in the high school mathematics courses are not included in the test. This was by design, as the test is a tool to assist advisors in placing students into the best course in the university-level mathematics sequence. The questions on the test were specifically selected with this single purpose in mind. This means the test is not a measure of everything that is learned in high school Mathematics courses. The test was not designed to measure program success or to compare students from one high school with students from another. It should be viewed only as a tool to be used for placing students at the university level.  As a placement instrument, the test has to be easy enough to identify those students needing remedial help, yet it also has to be complex enough to identify those students who are ready for calculus. Scores have to be precise enough to allow placement into many different levels of university coursework. In addition, the test has to be efficient to score, since thousands of students each year need to have their results promptly reported. In order to meet these criteria, the test development committee selected a multiple-choice format. The items measure four different areas of mathematical competence: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. Each skill area has a different set of detailed objectives, carefully developed to best match university mathematics curricula across the University of Wisconsin System.  Every year, a new form of the Mathematics Placement Test is published, along with some new pilot items for each component of the test, and administered to all incoming Freshmen in the UW System. All items are subjected to a statistical review to identify which items effectively distinguish the students with the strongest mathematics skills or the weakest mathematics skills from the general population of students. Only the items which are most useful for differentiating among students are ever considered for use on a future form of the test.  Although faculty cannot be considered disinterested observers, those who are familiar with the placement test feel that its quality is extremely high. The feeling among faculty at the participating UW institutions is that the test has helped enormously in placing students into appropriate courses. One of the strengths of the Mathematics Placement Test is that it is developed by faculty from throughout the University of Wisconsin System. Therefore, this test represents a UW System perspective with respect to the underlying skills that are necessary for success in our courses. One of the challenges, in this regard, is that the UW System campuses do not have a single Mathematics curriculum. Instead, each campus has its own curriculum and its own courses, which may or may not correspond well with courses on other UW campuses. To ensure that the placement test works well on each UW campus, each UW institution determines its own cutscores so as to optimize placement into its own Mathematics course sequence. Consequently, cutscores will vary from campus to campus as a result of curricular differences and student population differences. Also, on many campuses, the placement test is but one of several variables used for placing students, often also including ACT/SAT score, units of high school mathematics, and grades in high school mathematics courses.  The ability of this test to appropriately place students into courses rests in the quality of the match between test content and the institutional curricula at each UW campus. To ensure that the test mirrors the curriculum in introductory mathematics courses throughout UW System, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee has expanded to include one representative from most of the 14 UW institutions, as well as one Wisconsin high school mathematics teacher. This committee generally convenes twice each year to write and revise test items and discuss issues pertaining to test content and university curricula.  Recent Developments  Over the past few years, the Mathematics Placement Test has changed in several very important ways. Prior to the fall of 2000, the different campuses were combining items in different ways to form placement scores and make placement decisions. The particular set of items used by any one campus was selected to best match that campus' introductory curriculum. However, because campuses combined the test items in different ways, students who transferred from one UW institution to another often found themselves without valid placement scores and needing to retake the test. In 2000, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee agreed upon a common method for combining test objectives to create a uniform set of scores for reporting performance on the placement test. The three agreed-upon scores, one corresponding to each new objective, are labeled mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. These three scores are now used by all System institutions.  Historically, the Mathematics Placement Test has always been organized in three different sections, labeled A, B, and C. Students were instructed to take either sections A and B (which contained elementary and intermediate algebra) or sections B and C (which contained intermediate and college algebra and trigonometry), depending upon their mathematics background and desired college placement. However, our experience was that many students found it difficult to accurately assess their level of preparedness and would often take the wrong two sections. On most campuses, students who scored too high on the AB test or too low on the BC test could not be placed accurately and were required to retest with the appropriate two sections of the test. This was very inconvenient, both for the students and for the university's testing office. Beginning in the fall of 2002, the three different sections were shortened and combined, and all students were asked to complete the entire test. This has helped eliminate the confusion over which two sections to take and has reduced the number of students needing to retest.  General Characteristics of the Test  1. All items are to be completed by all students. The items are roughly ordered from elementary to advanced. The expectation is that less prepared students will answer fewer questions correctly than more prepared students.  2. The test consists entirely of multiple choice questions, each with five choices.  4. The Mathematics Placement Test is designed as a test of skill and not speed. Ample time is allowed for most students to answer all questions. Ninety (90) minutes are allowed to complete the test.  5. The mathematics basics component has a reliability of .85. The algebra component has a reliability of .90. The trigonometry component has a reliability of .85. For all three sections, items are selected of appropriate difficulty to provide useful information within the range of scores used for placement throughout the System campuses.  Test Description  The Mathematics Test Development Committee decided on three broad categories of items: mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. The entire Mathematics Placement Test is designed to be completed in 90 minutes, sufficient time for most students to complete the test.  Items for each of the three components are selected to conform to a carefully created set of detailed objectives. The percentage of items selected from each component are shown in Table 1 below.  Sample Items from the Trigonometry Component  Sample Trigonometry Items  Sample Geometry Items  Additional Statements About High School Preparation for College Mathematics Study  CALCULUS  The number of high schools offering some version of calculus has increased markedly since the UW System Math Test Committee's first statement of objectives and philosophy, and experience with these courses has shown the validity of the Committee's original position. This position was that a high school calculus program may work either to the advantage or to the disadvantage of students depending on the nature of the students and the program. Today, it seems necessary to mention the negative possibilities first.  A high school calculus program not designed to generate college calculus credit is likely to mathematically disadvantage students who go on to college. This is true for all such students whose college program entails use of mathematics skills, and particularly true of students whose college program involves calculus. High school programs of this type tend to be associated with curtailed or superficial preparation at the precalculus level and their students tend to have algebra deficiencies which hamper them not only in mathematics courses but in other courses in which mathematics is used.  The positive side is that a well-conceived high school calculus course which generates college calculus credit for its successful students will provide a mathematical advantage to students who go on to college. A study by the Mathematical Association of America identified the following features of successful high school calculus programs:  1. they are open only to interested students who have completed the standard four year college preparatory sequence. A choice of mathematics options is available to students who have completed this sequence at the start of their senior year.  2. they are full year courses taught at the college level in terms of text, syllabus, depth and rigor.  3. their instructors have had good mathematical preparation (e.g. at least one semester of junior/senior level real analysis) and are provided with additional preparation time.  4. instructors expect that their successful graduates will not repeat the course in college, but will get college credit for it.  A variety of special arrangements exist whereby successful graduates of a high school calculus course may obtain credit at one or another college. A generally accepted method is for the students to take the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board. Success rates of students on this exam can be a good tool for evaluation of the success of a high school calculus course.  GEOMETRY  The range of objectives in this document represents a small portion of the objectives of the traditional high school geometry course. The algebra objectives represent a substantial portion of the objectives of traditional high school algebra courses. The imbalance of test objectives can be explained in part by the nature of the entry level mathematics courses available at most colleges. The first college mathematics course generally will be either calculus or some level of algebra. A choice is usually based on three factors: (1) high school background; (2) placement test results; (3) curricular objectives. One reason for the emphasis on algebra in this document and on the test is that virtually all college placement decisions involve placement into a course which is more algebraic than geometric in character.  Still, there are reasons for maintaining a geometry course as an essential component in a college preparatory program. Since there are no entry level courses in geometry at the college level, it is essential that students master geometry objectives while in high school. High school geometry contributes to a level of mathematical maturity which is important for success in college.  LOGIC  Students should have the ability to use logic within a mathematical context, rather than the ability to do symbolic logic. The elements of logic which are particularly important include:  1. Use of the connectives "and' and "or" plus the "negation" of resultant statements, and recognition of the attendant relationship with the set operations "intersection," "union," and "complementation."  2. Interpretation of conditional statements of the form "if P then Q," including the recognition of converse and contrapositive.  3. Recognition that a general statement cannot be established by checking specific instances (unless the domain is finite), but that a general statement can be disproved by finding a single counter example. This should not discourage students from trying specific instances of a general statement to conjecture about its truth value.  Moreover, logical thinking or logical reasoning as a method should permeate the entire curriculum. In this sense, logic cannot be restricted to a single topic or emphasized only in proof-based courses. Logical reasoning should be explicitly taught and practiced in the context of all topics. From this, students should learn that forgotten formulas can be recovered by reasoning from basic principles, and that unfamiliar or complex problems can be solved in a similar way.  Although only two of the objectives explicitly refer to logic, the importance of logical thinking as a curriculum goal is not diminished. This goal, as well as other broad-based goals, is to be pursued despite the fact that it is not readily measured on placement tests.  PROBLEM SOLVING  Problem solving involves the definition and analysis of a problem together with the selecting and combining of mathematical ideas leading to a solution. Ideally, a complete set of problem solving skills would appear in the list of objectives. The fact that only a few problem solving objectives appear in the list does not diminish the importance of problem solving in the high school curriculum. The limitations of the multiple choice format preclude the testing of higher level problem solving skills.  MATHEMATICS ACROSS THE CURRICULUM  Mathematics is a basic skill of equal importance with reading, writing, and speaking. If basic skills are to be considered important and mastered by students, they must be encouraged and reinforced throughout the curriculum. Support for mathematics in other subject areas should include:  – a positive attitude toward mathematics  – attention to correct reasoning and the principles of logic  – use of quantitative skills  – application of mathematics curriculum.  COMPUTERS IN THE CURRICULUM  The impact of the computer on daily life is apparent, and consequently many high schools have instituted courses dealing with computer skills. While the learning of computer skills is important, computer courses should not be construed as replacements for mathematics courses.  CALCULATORS  There are occasions in college math courses when calculators are useful or even necessary (for example, to find values of trig functions), so students should be able to use calculators at a level consistent with the level at which they are studying mathematics (four-function calculators initially, scientific calculators in pre-calculus). A more compelling reason for being able to use calculators is that they will be needed in other courses involving applications of mathematics. The ability to use a calculator is very definitely a part of college preparation.  On the other hand, students need to be able to rapidly supply from their heads – whether by calculation or from memory – basic arithmetic, in order to be able to follow mathematical explanations. They should also know the conventional priority of arithmetic operations and be able to deal with grouping symbols in their heads. For example, students should know that (-3)2 s is 9, that -32 is -9, and that (-3)3 is -27 without needing to push buttons on their calculators. Moreover, students should be able to do enough mental estimation to check whether the results obtained via calculator are approximately correct.  Beginning in the spring of 1991, the use of scientific calculators has been allowed on the UW Mathematics Placement Test. The test was redesigned to accommodate the use of scientific calculators, so as to minimize the effects on placement due to the use or nonuse of calculators. Exact numbers such as π, continue to appear in both questions and answers where appropriate.  Use of scientific, non-graphing calculators is optional. Each student is advised to use or not use a calculator in a manner consistent with his or her prior classroom experience. Calculators will not be supplied at the test sites.  Mathematics curricula and faculty throughout UW are divided on whether or not to permit graphing calculators in classrooms. There remain many college-level courses for which graphing calculators are not allowed. Therefore, the placement test has not been revised to accommodate the use of graphing calculators. Students may not use graphing calculators for the Mathematics Placement Test.  PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS  Although university curricula are somewhat in a state of flux, with many basic issues and philosophies being examined, the normal entry level courses in mathematics remain the traditional algebra and calculus courses. Therefore, the placement tests must reflect those skills which are necessary for success in these courses. This is not intended to imply that courses stressing topics other than algebra and geometry are not vital to the high school mathematics curriculum, but rather that those topics do not assist in placing students in the traditional university entry level courses.  Probability and statistics are topics of value in the mathematical training of young people today that are not reflected on the placement test. It is the Committee's feeling that these topics are important to the elementary and secondary curriculum. They are gaining significance on university campuses, both within mathematics departments and within those departments not normally thought of as being quantitative in nature. The social sciences are seeking mathematical models to apply, and in general these models tend to be probabilistic or statistical. As a result, the curriculum in these areas is becoming heavily permeated with probability and statistics.  Mathematics departments are finding many of their graduates going into jobs utilizing computer science or statistics. Consequently, their curricula are beginning to reflect these trends. The Committee urges the educational community to develop and maintain meaningful instruction in probability and statistics.  How Teachers Can Help Students Prepare for the Test  The best way to prepare students for the placement tests is to offer a solid mathematics curriculum and to encourage students to take four years of college preparatory mathematics. We do not advise any special test preparation, as we have found that students who are prepared specifically for this test, either by practice sessions or the use of supplementary materials, score artificially high. Often such students are placed into a higher level course than their background dictates, resulting in these students either failing or being forced to drop the course. Due to enrollment difficulties on many campuses, students are unable to transfer into a more appropriate course after the semester has begun.  Significant factors in the placement level of a student are the high school courses taken as well as whether or not mathematics was taken in the senior year. Data indicate that four years of college preparatory mathematics in high school not only raises the entry level mathematics course, but predicts success in other areas as well, including the ability to graduate from college in four years.  Teachers should certainly feel free to encourage students to be well-rested and try to remain as relaxed as possible during the test. We intend that the experience be an enjoyable, yet challenging one. Remember that the test is designed to measure students at many different levels of mathematical preparedness; all students are not expected to answer all items correctly. There is no penalty for guessing, and intelligent guessing will most likely help students achieve a higher score.  Use of the Tests  When the UW System Mathematics Placement Tests were developed, they were written to be used strictly as a tool to aid in the most appropriate placement of students. They were not designed to compare students, to evaluate high schools or to dictate curriculum. The way an institution chooses to use the test to place students is a decision made by each institution. The Center for Placement Testing can and does help institutions with these decisions.  Each campus will continue to analyze and modify its curriculum and hence will continue to modify the way in which it uses the placement tests to place students. Cutoff scores might need to be changed over time to reflect the prerequisites for a campus' curriculum. It is also important for follow-up studies to be made to determine the effectiveness of the placement procedures. Contact must be maintained with the high schools so that modifications in the curriculum in both the high schools and in the UW System can be discussed.

__label__0 The Mathematics Department is committed to expanding students' understanding and appreciation of mathematics through a comprehensive, content-based plan that acknowledges and addresses differences in motivation, goals, ability, and learning styles. All students must complete three years of mathematics and pass a Regents examination. All mathematics courses are year-long courses.  Course Offerings  Integrated Algebra - This is the first mathematics course in high school. The completion of this course -- 1 to 2 years -- depends on the entry level of the student. Algebra provides tools and develops ways of thinking that are necessary for solving problems in a wide variety of disciplines such as science, business, and fine arts. Linear equations, quadratic functions, absolute value, and exponential functions are studied. Coordinate geometry is integrated into this course as well as data analysis, including measures of central tendency and lines of best fit. Elementary probability, right triangle trigonometry, and set theory complete the course. Students will take the Integrated Algebra Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.  Geometry - This is the second course in mathematics for high school students. In this course, students will have the opportunity to make conjectures about geometric situations and prove in a variety of ways that their conclusion follows logically from their hypothesis. Congruence and similarity of triangles will be established using appropriate theorems. Transformations including rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations will be taught. Properties of triangles, quadrilaterals and circles will be examined. Geometry is meant to lead students to an understanding that reasoning and proof are fundamental aspects of mathematics. Students will take the Geometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.  Algebra 2 and Trigonometry - This is the third of the three courses in high school mathematics. In this course, the number system will be extended to include imaginary and complex numbers. Students will learn about polynomial, absolute value, radical, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Problem situations involving direct and indirect variation will be solved. Data analysis will be extended to include measures of dispersion and the analysis of regression models. Arithmetic and geometric sequences will be evaluated. Binomial expressions will provide the basis for the study of probability theory, and the normal probability distribution will be analyzed. Right triangle trigonometry will be expanded to include the investigation of circular functions. The course will conclude with problems requiring the use of trigonometric equations and identities. Students will take the Algebra 2 and Trigonometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.  Calculus - This course includes an overview of analytic geometry and trigonometry as it applies to the study of functions, graph limits, derivatives and their applications.  Calculus AB, Advanced Placement - This is a full-year course in college-level calculus that culminates in the Advanced Placement (AB) examination.

__label__0 Specification  Aims  The course unit will deepen and extend students' knowledge and understanding of commutative algebra. By the end of the course unit the student will have learned more about familiar mathematical objects such as polynomials and algebraic numbers, will have acquired various computational and algebraic skills and will have seen how the introduction of structural ideas leads to the solution of mathematical problems.  Brief Description of the unit  The central theme of this course is factorisation (theory and practice) in commutative rings; rings of polynomials are our main examples but there are others, such as rings of algebraic integers.  Polynomials are familiar objects which play a part in virtually every branch of mathematics. Historically, the study of solutions of polynomial equations (algebraic geometry and number theory) and the study of symmetries of polynomials (invariant theory) were a major source of inspiration for the vast expansion of algebra in the 19th and 20th centuries.  In this course the algebra of polynomials in n variables over a field of coefficients is the basic object of study. The course covers fairly recent advances which have important applications to computer algebra and computational algebraic geometry (Gröbner bases - an extension of the Euclidean division algorithm to polynomials in 2 or more variables), together with a selection of more classical material.  Learning Outcomes  On successful completion of this course unit students will be able to demonstrate  facility in dealing with polynomials (in one and more variables);  understanding of some basic ideal structure of polynomial rings;  appreciation of the subtleties of factorisation into prime and irreducible elements;  ability to compute generating sets and Gröbner bases for ideals in polynomial rings;  ability to relate polynomials to other algebraic structures (algebraic varieties and groups of symmetries);  ability to solve problems relating to the factorisation of polynomials, irreducible polynomials and extension fields.  Future topics requiring this course unit  None, though the material connects usefully with algebraic geometry and Galois theory.  Textbooks  The first two books are useful general references on algebra though neither covers Gröbner bases (which is a relatively new topic). For Gröbner bases see the book by Cox, Little and O'Shea. The last book is a new textbook which combines Gröbner bases with more traditional material.  Teaching and learning methods  Two lectures and one examples class each week. In addition students should expect to spend at least four hours each week on private study for this course unit.  Course notes will be provided, as well as examples sheets and solutions. The notes will be concise and will need to be supplemented by your own notes taken in lectures, particularly of worked examples.

__label__0 Math Anxiety  Throughout grade school and maybe even in high school, many students felt there was no reason to take math.  These students hated math and felt they were never going to use it. There is still the tendency to think that only those who go into technical fields need math. Math teaches us to think. Math helps us to organize or thoughts, analyze information, and better understand the world around us.  There are myths about math that we have accepted as true and these tend to hold us back when it comes to learning math.  Some popular myths are:  Females aren't any good at math  The majority can't do well in math because only a few people really have mathematical minds. (We are happy to get a "C" in math whereas we won't accept a "C" in English or any other subject that we like. We expect to do poorly in math).  Some hints for studying math:  Read your text first, before you try any problems.  Write down the theorems and definitions, read them out loud, and then rewrite them into your own words.  Do a lot of problems and practice tests.  Don't cram for tests. Frequent practice and review is the key to learning math. If you cram, you will be unsure of yourself. Formulas will become confused and problems will look differently.  Don't keep looking in the back of your debt at the answers a. You may have the right answer but may not have done the problem correctly. b. If you have the wrong answer, it could affect your confidence and concentration.  When you aren't sure of a problem, ask for help, but never erase your work. Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.  Set aside a certain time everyday to study math.  Get extra help when you need it. Come to the PLC for tutoring; ask your teacher or a classmate for help. Remember, you need to understand math; that does not mean memorizing it.  Begin at the right place. If you feel that you need a review, be sure to start with a math class that begins at your level.  A common story instructors hear from math students is that the students can do the work or homework and in class but when it comes down to the test, the students freeze.  The number one problem of math test anxiety is negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is when you talk yourself deeper into anxiety. You think "what if" or "I can't". You worry about finishing the test on time. You tend to concentrate on how you are feeling, on how the anxiety is affecting you instead of on the test itself.  Some hints to counteract math test anxiety:  Confront your anxiety by admitting that you are worried about this test. Anxiety and fear react in the body in the same way, and admitting that you re anxious relieves some of the anxiety.  Use positive self-talk. Keep telling yourself that you can do this math, that you know this stuff, and that you are prepared.  Control your physical self. Take a brisk walk around the classroom buildings using positive self-talk while walking. Keep your heart rate and respiration steady by doing slow, five count deep breathing exercises. Loosen tight muscles on your neck by doing shoulder rolls forward and backward. Relax legs and arms by shake outs before you walk into the classroom.  Focus your attention away from yourself and towards the problem.  When taking practice tests or working on homework, keep a diary of the kinds of thoughts you are having while working out the problems. Relate these concerns to your tutor or teacher.  While the above suggestions will be helpful for the physical and emotional self, the following suggestions may be beneficial for the academic self.  Some hints to better test taking:  Write down formulas and other memorized information directly onto the test. This eliminates the risk of forgetting or altering the information incorrectly as you work the problems.  Preview the test. Find a problem you are comfortable with and start there. It is not necessary to work in numerical order. Try instead to choose an order that helps you stay positive.  Start with the easier problems. Also keep in mind the total point of the test and plan a strategy to get the most amount of points possible in the shortest amount of time.  Pass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive. If you find yourself becoming anxious, try some relaxation techniques to calm down physically and then focus back on the test.  Review the problems you've skipped. Maybe other problems you have solved can give you a better insight to the work needed for this problem.  Show some work for each problem, even if it's a guess. Partial credit is still good.  Allow for some time to look back over your work. Make sure you have read the directions correctly and look for careless errors.  Use all of the test time. Anxiety can induce a need to escape. Try to control the anxiety before this feeling takes over. Leaving a test early may mean a loss of points on your test as well as other negative feedback. Remember, always try to remain positive.  Remember, the key to conquering math anxiety is practice, practice, practice. The more confident you become in your ability, the better you will do.

__label__0 GOOD COURSES  CONTENTS  I. Undergraduate mathematics  A discussion of what a good undergrad programme in mathematics should be about can be found here. The book concerns mathematics in the American system, where applied mathematics was rarely taught in maths departments (at the time of writing). It also discusses the content often presented in four-year American liberal arts colleges, and two-year community colleges, and criticises the specialist nature of the topics chosen. The courses offered to students of science and engineering by departments of mathematics are also panned, one point being that the professor doing this job knows no science or engineering at all.  The author, Morris Kline, talks of the research professor, who hates teaching undergraduates of any sort, and also mentions the wide use made of graduate student tutors, who have neither training nor experience. Scarce mention is made of full, associate and assistant professors, who form (in my experience) the bulk of the academic staff in most departments of mathematics in American universities, and who do a very professional job in their teaching, as well as research and admin.  Some of the criticism of present methodology is way off centre. For example, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using over-simplified models. He argues that there is no point teaching the laws of falling bodies as if there were no air friction: tell that to a parachutist, he quips. In this he fails to capture the essence of science: we must study models, and compare with experiment, so that we may shoot them down, and revise them. More, we can usually find a range of applicability of the simple model, outside of which it is no longer a good one. But worse: he seems to be saying that only a fully developed, correct model should be taught. This goes against the teaching of Picasso: a teacher should mix a little bit of what we do not know with a lot of what we do know. I taught physics at Virginia Tech., a course in which the technician had prepared the "Galileo Bench". This was an inclined plane on an air cushion, in which Galileo's laws of falling bodies, s = s(0) + vt + 1/2 at2, was true, to within the experimental error. Some of the students found these laws hard to understand, even without friction. When they had achieved that, we went on to the refinements coming from friction. To start with the full theory, would place them in a similar position to Galileo... who had to cope with Aristotle's dictum that a force was needed to keep a body moving; when Galileo had abandoned this, he broke the 2000 year stalemate in science.  Most of the points made about the limited syllabus of a maths degree do not apply to the UK, where applied mathematics traditionally forms half of the degree in mathematics. However, with the possible replacement of A-levels with a bacc., our school programme might become more like the American one. We should then think about whether the university course might also move in that direction. Should we have four-year degree courses in mathematics, with the first year devoted to maths, physics, chemistry and computing? These could cover the four subjects to replace the omitted parts of A-level. The mathematics course could cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and statistics, complex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices. Physics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one dimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction, simple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave motion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations, and electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell). Chemistry might contain the Bohr atom, the Mendeleev table, the inorganic chemistry of acids and bases, salts and metals. Some physical chemistry such as the law of mass-action, and some organic chemistry, should be included. Lab work in physics and chemistry should be at the level now done in schools in the UK. Computing might introduce a useful language such as Java, Maple or Mathematica, and should give a general competence in Windows.  Kline suggests that scholarship in mathematics would serve a purpose, to reduce the number of pointless and empty papers, by critical reviews. This used to be the job of Mathematical Reviews, until it changed its policy, and now bans controversy in the reviews. Kline suggests that a new degree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not require original theorems, but would be readable and deep. We have something similar, in the M. Phil., which however has not got the status of the Ph. D.  III.Abstract Algebra  IV. Graph theory  V. The Kentucky Archives on Mathematics  The site of the University of Kentucky hosts a list of free material on mathematics, of which III. above is just one. I found the course on partial differential equations very useful. The course on Hilbert Space Methods for Partial Differential Equations, by R. E. Showalter, is very pleasant indeed. It is slightly informal in its definition of distributions, but this is all that is needed for partial differential equations at this level.  VI.Wikipedia  Wikipedia is a free internet encyclopaedia, written by its viewers. There is quite a large set of mathematics pages, as well as pages on physics and other sciences, and all other subjects. Some pages are sketchy, and others are literally empty, awaiting the first volunteer. I found a mistake in Wightman's biography: it said he was British. I was able to edit that page and correct it. The statement of the Navier-Stokes equations could not be right, as the terms do not all have the same physical dimension.  The site is worth a browse, and might become more reliable as time passes.

__label__0 The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.  This book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.  Readership  Undergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.  Reviews  "Lee's "Axiomatic Geometry" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end."  -- Robin Hartshorne, University of California, Berkeley  "The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.  "Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions."  -- I. Martin Isaacs, University of Wisconsin-Madison  "Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry."
__label__0 Many of the problems students experience with A-Level Physics are associated with the mathematics involved. This title deals with this problem offering support for mathematics in physics.

__label__0 Calculators Are for Calculating, Mathematica Is for Calculus  Mathematica is the perfect tool to help calculus professors and instructors overcome limitations with traditional approaches to teaching calculus. Students can experience a more enriching calculus rather than the algorithm-driven method they are used to seeing. We'll look at different ways Mathematica can be used to enhance your calculus class, such as using interactive models to engage students and connecting calculus to the real world with built-in datasets. Topics include the squeeze theorem, derivative tests, revolving solids about axes, and more.
__label__0 partial differential equations that govern scalar and vector fields are the very language used to model a variety of phenomena in solid mechanics, fluid flow, acoustics, heat transfer, electromagnetism and many others. A knowledge of the main equations and of the methods for analyzing them is therefore essential to every working physical scientist and engineer. Andrea Prosperetti draws on many years' research experience to produce a guide to a wide variety of methods, ranging from classical Fourier-type series through to the theory of distributions and basic functional analysis. Theorems are stated precisely and their meaning explained, though proofs are mostly only sketched, with comments and examples being given more prominence. The book structure does not require sequential reading: each chapter is self-contained and users can fashion their own path through the material. Topics are first introduced in the context of applications, and later complemented by a more thorough presentation. less

__label__0 eBook Ordering Options  DescriptionExamining how information technology has changed mathematical requirements, the idea of Techno-mathematical Literacies (TmL) is introduced to describe the emerging need to be fluent in the language of mathematical inputs and outputs to technologies and to interpret and communicate with these, rather than merely to be procedurally competent with calculations. The authors argue for careful analyses of workplace activities, looking beyond the conventional thinking about numeracy, which still dominates policy arguments about workplace mathematics. Throughout their study, the authors answer the following fundamental questions:  What mathematical knowledge and skills matter for the world of work today?  How does information technology change the necessary knowledge and the ways in which it is encountered?  How can we develop these essential new skills in the workforce?  With evidence of successful opportunities to learn with TmL that were co-designed and evaluated with employers and employees, this book provides suggestions for the development of TmL through the use of authentic learning activities, and interactive software design. Essential reading for trainers and managers in industry, teachers, researchers and lecturers of mathematics education, and stakeholders implementing evidence-based policy, this book maps the fundamental changes taking place in workplace mathematics.

__label__0 Discovering Geometry Intro  Discovering Geometry began in my classroom over 35 years ago. During my first ten years of teaching I did not use a textbook, but created my own daily lesson plans and classroom management system. I believe students learn with greater depth of understanding when they are actively engaged in the process of discovering concepts and we should delay the introduction of proof in geometry until students are ready. Until Discovering Geometry, no textbook followed that philosophy.  I was also involved in a Research In Industry grant where I repeatedly heard that the skills valued in all working environments were the ability to express ideas verbally and in writing, and the ability to work as part of a team. I wanted my students to be engaged daily in doing mathematics and exchanging ideas in small cooperative groups.  The fourth edition of Discovering Geometry includes new hands-on techniques, curriculum research, and technologies that enhance my vision of the ideal geometry class. I send my heartfelt appreciation to the many teachers who contributed their feedback during classroom use. Their students and future students will help continue the evolution of Discovering Geometry.

__label__0 Consumer Math develops consumer skills in a biblical framework. It was written with the hope and prayer that students would know Christ as Savior, grow in their knowledge of Him, and understand the value of mathematics for their Christian growth and service. Bible verses and applications are included throughout, and each chapter has an in-depth Bible study on stewardship. These features include a mathematics-related theme verse, which you may want your students to memorize. The text is designed to be flexible. It is intended to meet needs of various teachers and teaching goals. Since each class is unique and students have varying abilities, the teacher should adapt the materials to his students. Determine which sections will demand extra time and which sections will be skipped. Select resources and ideas from this Teacher's Edition that are appropriate for the students.
__label__0 Post navigation  Reading Math  My Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.  But that doesn't mean that I don't want them reading math. Kids are never taught to "read" a math textbook. If they ever do approach a math textbook, they approach it like a history book. The read it linearly. They also read it passively. Their eyes glaze over. They read words, but they don't try to connect the words to the equations or pictures. They don't read with a pencil in their hands. They hope for some Divine Knowledge to descend upon them simply by having the book open and their eyes on it.  That doesn't work. We all know this. Reading math is an active thing.  And so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.  For question A, some representative responses:  "I read what was assigned to me but did not read anything extra." "I find that textbook reading is pretty boring, so I don't do it unless I have to." "I did not because I had assumed I wouldn't learn things I needed. All I would do was look at examples." "No, I find it difficult to understand math when reading it in paragraphs; it makes more sense to me with a teacher." "I did not generally read my math textbooks. I did, however, always look over the example problems."  Some responses for Question B:  1. The writing can be confusing, wordy, and not thorough 2. The book is BORING 3. Small print 4. Too many words for math 5. Outdated examples  Some responses for Question C  1. Everything is all in one place 2. Have a glossary 3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck 4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures 5. Real life examples 6. Definitions clear 7. Key terms are highlighted 8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions 9. Colors!  I hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.  I also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own "textbook" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.  Anyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!  Post navigation  3 thoughts on "Reading Math"  I found that reading "How to read a book" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.  My son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.  I think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.  I still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.

__label__0 Syllabus Structure and Content  3.1 INTRODUCTION  The way in which the mathematical content in the syllabuses is organised and presented in the syllabus document is described in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Section 3.3 also discusses the main alterations, both in content and in emphasis, with respect to the preceding versions. The forthcoming changes in the primary curriculum, which will have "knock-on" effects at second level, are outlined in Section 3.4. Finally, in Section 3.5, the content is related to the aims of the syllabuses.  3.2 STRUCTURE  For the Higher and Ordinary level syllabuses, the mathematical material forming the content is divided into eight sections, as follows:  Sets  Number systems  Applied arithmetic and measure  Algebra  Statistics  Geometry  Trigonometry  Functions and graphs  The corresponding material for the Foundation level syllabus is divided into seven sections; there are minor differences in the sequence and headings, resulting in the following list:  Sets  Number systems  Applied arithmetic and measure  Statistics and data handling  Algebra  Relations, functions and graphs  Geometry  The listing by content area is intended to give mathematical coherence to the syllabuses, and to help teachers locate specific topics (or check that topics are not listed). The content areas are reasonably distinct, indicating topics with different historical roots and different main areas of application. However, they are inter-related and interdependent, and it is not intended that topics would be dealt with in total isolation from each other. Also, while the seven or eight areas, and the contents within each area, are presented in a logical sequence ­ combining, as far as possible, a sensible mathematical order with a developmental one for learners ­ it is envisaged that many content areas listed later in the syllabus would be introduced before or alongside those listed earlier. (For example, geometry appears near the end of the list, but the course committee specifically recommends that introductory geometrical work is started in First Year, allowing plenty of time for the ideas to be developed in a concrete way, and thoroughly understood, before the more abstract elements are introduced.) However, the different order of listing for the Foundation level syllabus does reflect a suggestion that the introduction of some topics (notably formal algebra) might be delayed. Some of these points are taken up in Section 4.  Appropriate pacing of the syllabus content over the three years of the junior cycle is a challenge. Decisions have to be made at class or school level. Some of the factors affecting the decisions are addressed in these Guidelines in Section 4, under the heading of planning and organisation.  3.3 SYLLABUS CONTENT  The contents of the Higher, Ordinary and Foundation level syllabuses are set out in the corresponding sections of the syllabus document. In each case, the content is presented in the two-column format used for the Leaving Certificate syllabuses introduced in the 1990s, with the lefthand column listing the topics and the right-hand column adding notes (for instance, providing illustrative examples, or highlighting specific aspects of the topics which are included or excluded). Further illustration of the depth of treatment of topics is given in Section 5 (in dealing with assessment) and in the proposed sample assessmentmaterials (available separately).  CHANGES IN CONTENT  As indicated in Section 1, the revisions deal only with specific problems in the previous syllabuses, and do not reflect a root-and-branch review of the mathematics education appropriate for students in the junior cycle. The main changes in content, addressing the problems identified in Section 1, are described below. A summary ofall the changes is provided in Appendix 1.  Calculators and calculator-related techniques  As pointed out in the introduction to each syllabus, calculators are assumed to be readily available for appropriate use, both as teaching/learning tools and as computational aids; they will also be allowed in examinations.  The concept of "appropriate" use is crucial here. Calculators are part of the modern world, and students need to be able to use them efficiently where and when required. Equally, students need to retain and develop their feel for number, while the execution of mental calculations, for instance to make estimates, becomes even more important than it was heretofore. Estimation, which was not mentioned in the 1987 syllabus (though it was covered in part by the phrase "the practice of approximating before evaluating"), now appears explicitly and will be tested in examinations.  The importance of the changes in this area is reflected in two developments. First, a set of guidelines on calculators is being produced. It addresses issues such as the purchase of suitable machines as well as the rationale for their use. Secondly, in 1999 the Department of Education and Science commissioned a research project to monitor numeracy-related skills (with and without calculators) over the period of introduction of the revised syllabuses. If basic numeracy and mental arithmetic skills are found to disimprove, remedial action may have to be taken. It is worth noting that research has not so far isolated any consistent association between calculator use in an education system and performance by students from that system in international tests of achievement.  Mathematical tables are not mentioned in the content sections of the syllabus, except for a brief reference indicating that they are assumed to be available, likewise for appropriate use. Teachers and students can still avail of them as learning tools and for reference if they so wish. Tables will continue to be available in examinations, but questions will not specifically require students to use them.  Geometry  The approach to synthetic geometry was one of the major areas which had to be confronted in revising the syllabuses. Evidence from examination scripts suggested that in many cases the presentation in the 1987 syllabus was not being followed in the classroom. In particular, in the Higher level syllabus, the sequence of proofs and intended proof methods were being adapted. Teachers were responding to students' difficulties in coping with the approach that attempted to integrate transformational concepts with those more traditionally associated with synthetic geometry, as described in Section 1.1 of these Guidelines.  For years, and all over the world, there have been difficulties in deciding how ­ indeed, whether ­ to present synthetic geometry and concepts of logical proof to students of junior cycle standing. Their historical importance, and their role as guardians of one of the defining aspects of mathematics as a discipline, have led to a wish to retain them in the Irish mathematics syllabuses; but the demands made on students who have not yet reached the Piagetian stage of formal operations are immense. "Too much, too soon" not only contravenes the principle of learnability (section 2.5), but leads to rote learning and hence failure to attain the objectives which the geometry sections of the syllabuses are meant to address. The constraints of a minor revision precluded the question of "whether" from being asked on this occasion. The question of "how" raises issues to do with the principles of soundness versus learnability. The resulting formulation set out in the syllabus does not claim to be a full description of a geometrical system. Rather, it is intended to provide a defensible teaching sequence that will allow students to learn geometry meaningfully and to come to realise the power of proof. Some of the issues that this raises are discussed in Appendix 2.  The revised version can be summarised as follows.  The approach omits the transformational elements, returning to a more traditional approach based on congruency.  In the interests of consistency and transfer between levels, the underlying ideas are basically the same across all three syllabuses, though naturally they are developed to very different levels in the different syllabuses.  The system has been carefully formulated to display the power of logical argument at a level which ­ hopefully ­ students can follow and appreciate. It is therefore strongly recommended that, in the classroom, material is introduced in the sequence in which it is listed in the syllabus document. For theHigher level syllabus, the concepts of logicalargument and rigorous proof are particularlyimportant. Thus, in examinations, attempted proofsthat presuppose "later" material in order to establish"earlier" results will be penalised. Moreover, proofsusing transformations will not be accepted.  To shorten the Higher level syllabus, only some of the theorems have been designated as ones for which students may be asked to supply proofs in the examinations. The other theorems should still beproved as part of the learning process;students should be able to follow the logical development, and see models of far more proofs than they are expected to reproduce at speed under examination conditions. The required saving of time is expected to occur because students do not have to put in the extra effort needed to develop fluency in writing out particular proofs.  Students taking the Ordinary and (a fortiori)Foundation level syllabuses are not required to prove theorems, but ­ in accordance with the level-specific aims (Section 2.4) ­ should experience the logical reasoning involved in ways in which they can understand it. The general thrust of the synthetic geometry section of the syllabuses for these students is not changed from the 1987 versions.  It may be noted that the formulation of the Foundation level syllabus in 1987 emphasised the learning process rather than the product or outcomes. In the current version, the teaching/learning suggestions are presented in theseGuidelines (chiefly in Section 4), not in the syllabus document. It is important to emphasise that the changed formulation in the syllabus is not meant to point to a more formal presentation than previously suggested for Foundation level students.  Section 4.9 of this document contains a variety of suggestions as to how the teaching of synthetic geometry to junior cycle students might be addressed.  Transformation geometry still figures in the syllabuses, but is treated separately from the formal development of synthetic geometry. The approach is intended to be intuitive, helping students to develop their visual and spatial ability. There are opportunities here to build on the work on symmetry in the primary curriculum and to develop aesthetic appreciation of mathematical patterns.  Other changes to the Higher level syllabus  Logarithms are removed. Their practical role as aids to calculation is outdated; the theory of logarithms is sufficiently abstract to belong more comfortably to the senior cycle.  Many topics are "pruned" in order to shorten the syllabus.  Other changes to the Ordinary level syllabus  The more conceptually difficult areas of algebra and coordinate geometry are simplified.  A number of other topics are "pruned".  Other changes to the Foundation level syllabus  There is less emphasis on fractions but rather more on decimals. (The change was introduced partly because of the availability of calculators ­ though, increasingly, calculators have buttons and routines which allow fractions to be handled in a comparatively easy way.)  The coverage of statistics and data handling is increased. These topics can easily be related to students' everyday lives, and so can help students to recognise the relevance of mathematics. They lend themselves also to active learning methods (such as those presented in Section 4) and the use of spatial as well as computational abilities. Altogether, therefore, the topics provide great scope for enhancing students' enjoyment and appreciation of mathematics. They also give opportunities for developing suitably concrete approaches to some of the more abstract material, notably algebra and functions (see Section 4.8).  The algebra section is slightly expanded. The formal algebraic content of the 1987 syllabus was so slight that students may not have had scope to develop their understanding; alternatively, teachers may have chosen to omit the topic. The rationale for the present adjustment might be described as "use it or lose it". The hope is that the students will be able to use it, and that ­ suitably addressed ­ it can help them in making some small steps towards the more abstract mathematics which they may need to encounter later in the course of their education.  Overall, therefore, it is hoped that the balance between the syllabuses is improved. In particular, the Ordinary level syllabus may be better positioned between a more accessible Higher level and a slightly expanded Foundation level.  CHANGES IN EMPHASIS  The brief for revision of the syllabuses, as described in Section 1.2, precluded a root-and-branch reconsideration of their style and content. However, it did allow for some changes in emphasis: or rather, in certain cases, for some of the intended emphases to be made more explicit and more clearly related to rationale, content, assessment, and ­ via the Guidelines ­ methodology. The changes in, or clarification of, emphasis refer in particular to the following areas.  Understanding  General objectives B and C of the syllabus refer respectively to instrumental understanding (knowing "what" to do or "how" to do it, and hence being able to execute procedures) and relational understanding (knowing "why", understanding the concepts of mathematics and the way in which they connect with each other to form so-called "conceptual structures"). When people talk of teaching mathematics for ­ or learning it with ­ understanding, they usually mean relational understanding. The language used in the Irish syllabuses to categorise understanding is that of Skemp; the objectives could equally well have been formulated in terms of "procedures" and "concepts".  Research points to the importance of both kinds of understanding, together with knowledge of facts (general objective A), as components of mathematical proficiency, with relational understanding being crucial for retaining and applying knowledge. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, indicated that Irish teachers regard knowledge of facts and procedures as particularly important ­ unusually so in international terms; but it would appear that less heed is paid to conceptual/relational understanding. This is therefore given special emphasis in the revised syllabuses. Such understanding can be fostered by active learning, as described and illustrated in Section 4. Ways in which relational understanding can be assessed are considered in Section 5.  Communication  General objective H of the syllabus indicates that students should be able to communicate mathematics, both verbally and in written form, by describing and explaining the mathematical procedures they undertake and by explaining their findings and justifying their conclusions. This highlights the importance of students expressing mathematics in their own words. It is one way of promoting understanding; it may also help students to take ownership of the findings they defend, and so to be more interested in their mathematics and more motivated to learn.  The importance of discussion as a tool for ongoing assessment of students' understanding is highlighted in Section 5.2. In the context of examinations, the ability to show different stages in a procedure, explain results, give reasons for conclusions, and so forth, can be tested; some examples are given in Section 5.6.  Appreciation and enjoyment  General objective I of the syllabus refers to appreciating mathematics. As pointed out earlier, appreciation may develop for a number of reasons, from being able to do the work successfully to responding to the abstract beauty of the subject. It is more likely to develop, however, when the mathematics lessons themselves are pleasant occasions.  In drawing up the revised syllabus and preparing the Guidelines, care has been taken to include opportunities for making the teaching and learning of mathematics more enjoyable. Enjoyment is good in its own right; also, it can develop students' motivation and hence enhance learning. For many students in the junior cycle, enjoyment (as well as understanding) can be promoted by the active learning referred to above and by placing the work in appropriate meaningful contexts. Section 4 contains many examples of enjoyable classroom activities which promote both learning and appreciation of mathematics. Teachers are likely to have their own battery of such activities which work for them and their classes. It is hoped that these can be shared amongst their colleagues and perhaps submitted for inclusion in the final version of the Guidelines.  Of course, different people enjoy different kinds of mathematical activity. Appreciation and enjoyment do not come solely from "games"; more traditional classrooms also can be lively places in which teachers and students collaborate in the teaching and learning of mathematics and develop their appreciation of the subject. Teachers will choose approaches with whichthey themselves feel comfortable and which meet thelearning needs of the students whom they teach.  The changed or clarified emphasis in the syllabuses will be supported, where possible, by corresponding adjustments to the formulation and marking of Junior Certificate examination questions. While the wording ofquestions may be the same, the expected solutions may bedifferent. Examples are given in Section 5.  3.4 CHANGES IN THE PRIMARY CURRICULUM  The changes in content and emphasis within the revised Junior Certificate mathematics syllabuses are intended, inter alia, to follow on from and build on the changes in the primary curriculum. The forthcoming alterations (scheduled to be introduced in 2002, but perhaps starting earlier in some classrooms, as teachers may anticipate the formal introduction of the changes) will affect the knowledge and attitudes that students bring to their second level education. Second level teachers need to be prepared for this. A summary of the chief alterations is given below; teachers are referred to the revised Primary School Curriculum for further details.  CHANGES IN EMPHASIS  In the revised curriculum, the main changes of emphasis are as follows.  There is more emphasis on  setting the work in real-life contexts  learning through hands-on activities (using concrete materials/manipulatives, and so forth)  understanding (in particular, gaining appropriaterelational understanding as well as instrumentalunderstanding)  appropriate use of mathematical language  recording  problem-solving.  There is less emphasis on  learning routine procedures with no context provided  doing complicated calculations.  CHANGES IN CONTENT  The changes in emphasis are reflected in changes to the content, the main ones being as follows.  New areas include  introduction of the calculator from Fourth Class (augmenting, not replacing, paper-and-pencil techniques)  (hence) extended treatment of estimation;  increased coverage of data handling  introduction of basic probability ("chance").  New terminology includes  the use of the "positive" and "negative" signs for denoting a number (as in +3 [positive three], -6 [negative six] as well as the "addition" and "subtraction" signs for denoting an operation (as in 7 + 3, 24 ­ 9)  explicit use of the multiplication sign in formulae (as in 2 ×r , l ×w).  The treatment of subtraction emphasises the "renaming" or "decomposition" method (as opposed to the "equal additions" method ­ the one which uses the terminology "paying back") even more strongly than does the 1971 curriculum. Use of the word "borrowing" is discouraged.  The following topics are among those excluded from the revised curriculum:  unrestricted calculations (thus, division is restricted to at most four-digit numbers being divided by at most two-digit numbers, and ­ for fractions ­ to division of whole numbers by unit fractions)  (Some of these topics were not formally included in the 1971 curriculum, but appeared in textbooks and were taught in many classrooms.)  NOTE  The reductions in content have removed some areas of overlap between the 1971 Primary School Curriculum and the Junior Certificate syllabuses. Some overlap remains, however. This is natural; students entering second level schooling need to revise the concepts and techniques that they have learnt at primary level, and also need to situate these in the context of their work in the junior cycle.  3.5 LINKING CONTENT AREAS WITH AIMS  Finally, in this section, the content of the syllabuses is related to the aims and objectives. In fact most aims and objectives can be addressed in most areas of the syllabuses. However, some topics are more suited to the attainment of certain goals or the development of certain skills than are others. The discussion below highlights some of the main possibilities, and points to the goals that might appropriately be emphasised when various topics are taught and learnt. Phrases italicised are quoted or paraphrased from the aims as set out in the syllabus document. Section 5 of these Guidelines indicates a variety of ways in which achievement of the relevant objectives might be encouraged, tested or demonstrated.  SETS  Sets provide a conceptual foundation for mathematics and a language by means of which mathematical ideas can be discussed. While this is perhaps the main reason for which set theory was introduced into school mathematics, its importance at junior cycle level can be described rather differently.  Set problems, obviously, call for skills of problem-solving; in particular, they provide occasions for logical argument. By using data gathered from the class, they even offer opportunities for simple introduction to mathematical modelling in contexts to which the students can relate.  Moreover, set theory emphasises aspects of mathematics that are not purely computational. Sets are about classification, hence about tidiness and organisation. This can lead toappreciation of mathematics on aesthetic grounds and can help to provide a basis forfurther education in the subject.  An additional point is that this topic is not part of the Primary School Curriculum, and so represents a new start, untainted by previous failure. For some students, therefore, there are particularly important opportunities for personal development.  NUMBER SYSTEMS  While mathematics is not entirely quantitative, numeracy is one of its most important aspects. Students have been building up their concepts of numbers from a very early stage in their lives. However, moving from familiarity with natural numbers (and simple operations on them) to genuine understanding of the various forms in which numbers are presented and of the uses to which they are put in the world is a considerable challenge.  Weakness in this area destroys students' confidence andcompetence by depriving them of theknowledge, skillsand understanding needed for continuing theireducation and for life and work. It therefore handicaps their personal fulfilment and hencepersonaldevelopment.  The aspect of "understanding" is particularly important ­ or, perhaps, has had its importance highlighted ­ with advances in technology.  Students need to become familiar with the intelligent and appropriate use of calculators, while avoiding dependence on the calculators for simple calculations.  Complementing this, they need to develop skills in estimation and approximation, so that numbers can be used meaningfully.  APPLIED ARITHMETIC AND MEASURE  This topic is perhaps one of the easiest to justify in terms of providing mathematics needed for life, workand leisure.  Students are likely to use the skills developed here in "everyday" applications, for example in looking after their personal finances and in structuring the immediate environment in which they will live. For many, therefore, this may be a key section in enabling studentsto develop a positive attitude towards mathematics as avaluable subject of study.  There are many opportunities for problem-solving, hopefully in contexts that the students recognise as relevant.  The availability of calculators may remove some of the drudgery that can be associated with realistic problems, helping the students to focus on the concepts and applications that bring the topics to life.  ALGEBRA  Algebra was developed because it was needed ­ because arguments in natural language were too clumsy or imprecise. It has become one of the most fundamental tools for mathematics.  As with number, therefore, confidence andcompetence are very important. Lack of these underminethepersonal development of the students by depriving them of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed forcontinuing their education and for life and work.  Without skills in algebra, students lack the technical preparation for study of other subjects in school, and in particular their foundation for appropriate studies lateron ­ including further education in mathematics itself.  It is thus particularly important that students develop appropriate understanding of the basics of algebra so that algebraic techniques are carried out meaningfully and not just as an exercise in symbol-pushing.  Especially for weaker students, this can be very challenging because algebra involves abstractions andgeneralisations.  However, these characteristics are among the strengths and beauties of the topic. Appropriately used, algebra can enhance the students' powers of communication, facilitate simplemodelling and problem-solving, and hence illustrate the power of mathematics as a valuablesubject of study.  STATISTICS  One of the ways in which the world is interpreted for us mathematically is by the use of statistics. Their prevalence, in particular on television and in the newspapers, makes them part of the environment in which children grow up, and provides students with opportunities for recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.  Many of the examples refer to the students' typical areas of interest; examples include sporting averages and trends in purchases of (say) CDs.  Students can provide data for further examples from their own backgrounds and experiences.  Presenting these data graphically can extend students'powers of communication and their ability to shareideas with other people, and may also provide anaesthetic element.  The fact that statistics can help to develop a positiveattitude towards mathematics as an interesting andvaluable subject of study ­ even for weaker students who find it hard to appreciate the more abstract aspects of the subject ­ explains the extra prominence given to aspects of data handling in the Foundation level syllabus, as mentioned earlier. They may be particularly important in promotingconfidence and competence in both numerical and spatial domains.  GEOMETRY  The study of geometry builds on the primary school study of shape and space, and hence relates to mathematics in the world around us. In the junior cycle, different approaches to geometry address different educational goals.  More able students address one of the greatest of mathematical concepts, that of proof, and hopefully come to appreciate theabstractions andgeneralisations involved.  Other students may not consider formal proof, but should be able to draw appropriate conclusions from given geometrical data.  MATHEMATICS  Explaining and defending their findings, in either case, should help students to further their powersof communication.  Tackling "cuts" and other exercises based on the geometrical system presented in the syllabus allows students to develop their problem-solving skills.  Moreover, in studying synthetic geometry, students are encountering one of the great monuments to intellectual endeavour: a very special part of Western culture.  Transformation geometry builds on the study of symmetry at primary level. As the approach to transformation geometry in the revised Junior Certificate syllabus is intuitive, it is included in particular for its aesthetic value.  With the possibility of using transformations in artistic designs, it allows students to encounter creative aspectsof mathematics and to develop or exercise their own creative skills.  It can also develop their spatial ability, hopefully promotingconfidence and competence in this area.  Instances of various types of symmetry in the natural and constructed environment give scope for students' recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.  Coordinate geometry links geometrical and algebraic ideas. On the one hand, algebraic techniques can be used to establish geometric results; on the other, algebraic entities are given pictorial representations.  Its connections with functions and trigonometry, as well as algebra and geometry, make it a powerful tool for the integration of mathematics into a unified structure.  It illustrates the power of mathematics, and so helps to establish it with students as a valuable subject of study.  It provides an important foundation for appropriatestudies later on.  The graphical aspect can add a visually aestheticdimension to algebra.  TRIGONOMETRY  Trigonometry is a subject that has its roots in antiquity but is still of great practical use to-day. While its basic concepts are abstract, they can be addressed through practical activities.  Situations to which it can be applied ­ for example, house construction, navigation, and various ball games ­ include many that are relevant to the students' life, work and leisure.  It can therefore promote the students' recognition andenjoyment of mathematics in the world around them.  With the availability of calculators, students may more easily develop competence and confidence through their work in this area.  FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS  The concept of a function is crucial in mathematics, and students need a good grasp of it in order to prepare a firm foundation for appropriate studies lateron and in particular, a basis for further education inmathematics itself.  The representation of functions by graphs adds a pictorial element that students may find aesthetic as well as enhancing their understanding and their abilityto handle generalisations.  This topic pulls together much of the groundwork done elsewhere, using the tools introduced and skills developed in earlier sections and providing opportunities forproblem-solving and simple modelling.  For Foundation students alone, simple work on the set-theoretic treatment of relations has been retained. In contexts that can be addressed by those whose numerical skills are poor, it provides exercises in simple logical thinking.  NOTE  The foregoing argument presents just one vision of the rationale for including the various topics in the syllabus and for the ways in which the aims of the mathematics syllabus can be achieved. All teachers will have their own ideas about what can inspire and inform different topic areas. Their own personal visions of mathematics, and their particular areas of interest and expertise, may lead them to implement the aims very differently from the way that is suggested here. Visions can profitably be debated at teachers' meetings, with new insights being given and received as a result.  The tentative answers given here with regard to whycertain topics are included in the syllabus are, of course, offered to teachers rather than junior cycle students. In some cases, students also may find the arguments relevant. In other cases, however, the formulation is too abstract or the benefit too distant to be of interest. This, naturally, can cause problems. Clearly it would not be appropriate to reduce the syllabus to material that has immediately obvious applications in the students' everyday lives. This would leave them unprepared for further study, and would deprive them of sharing parts of our culture; in any case, not all students are motivated by supposedly everyday topics.  Teachers are therefore faced with a challenging task in helping students find interest and meaning in all parts of the work. Many suggestions with proven track records in Irish schools are offered in Section 4. As indicated earlier, it is hoped that teachers will offer more ideas for an updated version of the Guidelines.

__label__0 Computer algebra system  A computer algebra system (CAS) is a software program that facilitates symbolic mathematics. The core functionality of a CAS is manipulation of mathematical expressions in symbolic form.  The expressions typically include polynomials in multiple variables; standard functions of expressions (sin, exponential, etc.); arbitrary functions of expressions; integrals, sums, and products of expressions; truncated series with expressions as coefficients, matrices of expressions, and so on. (This is a recursive definition.)  The symbolic manipulations supported typically include  simplification  substitution of symbolic or numeric values for expressions  change of form of expressions: expanding products and powers, rewriting as partial fractions, etc.  Many also include a high level programming language, allowing users to implement their own algorithms.  The study of algorithms useful for computer algebra systems is known as computer algebra.  The run-time of numerical programs implemented in computer algebra systems is normally longer than that of equivalent programs implemented in systems such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, or directly in C, since they are programmed for full symbolic generality and thus cannot use machine numerical operations directly.  History  Computer algebra systems began to appear in the early 1970s, and evolved out of research into artificial intelligence, though the fields are now regarded as largely separate. The first popular systems were Reduce, Derive, and Macsyma which are still commercially available; a copyleft version of Macsyma called Maxima is actively being maintained. The current market leaders are Maple and Mathematica; both are commonly used by research mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. MuPAD is a commercial system, also available in a free version with slightly restricted user interface for non-commercial research and educational use. Some computer algebra systems focus on a specific area of application; these are typically developed in academia and

As concentration camps do not provide books, paper, pen or pencils nearly all of his calculations had to be performed mentally. This forced Trachtenberg to develop methods and shortcuts for performing calculations mentally. Trachtenberg developed his discoveries into a complete system of mathematics.  After the Second World War, Trachtenberg started teaching his system of mathematics. He started teaching the more backward children to prove that anyone could learn his system. In 1950 he founded the Mathematical Institute in Zurich, where both children and adults were taught the system.  The system has been thoroughly tested in Switzerland and is found to produce an increase in self confidence and general aptitude to study, as the students prove to themselves what they are capable of, by their accomplishments in calculating results to computations.  The Trachtenberg system is based on a series of keys which must be memorized. There is no need for multiplication tables or division as the system only relies on the ability to count. The system also places an emphasis on getting the right answer and provides a number of methods for checking the answers achieved by the system.  Research on the system, indicates that the system shortens time for mathematical computations by twenty percent and produces correct results, ninety nine percent of the time, due to the checking method used as part of the system.

__label__0 A formal framework to convey ideas about the components of a host-parasite interaction. Construction requires three major types of information: (a) a clear understanding of the interaction within the individual host between the infectious agent and the host, (b) the mode and rate of transmission between individuals, and (c) host population characteristics such as demography and behaviour. Mathematical models can aid exploration of the behaviour of the system under various conditions from which to determine the dominant factors generating observed patterns and phenomena. They also aid data collection and interpretation and parameter estimation, and provide tools for identifying possible approaches to control and for assessing the potential impact of different intervention measures.  Related Topics: [ model] A set of mathematical equations which attempts to predict the behavior of a physical system(s). For example, the Rational Formula, Q = Cia, is a mathematical model for peak runoff rate prediction with a single dependent variable, Q, and three independent parameter s: C, i and A. Often the term "simulation model" is used in lieu of mathematical model, because the relationships are intended to simulate actions of physical systems.  An abstraction of a real-world problem into a mathematical problem. Creating a mathematical model can involve making assumptions and simplifications; creating geometric figures, graphs, and tables; or finding equations that approximate the behavior of a real event. The mathematical problem can then be solved. When the solution is interpreted it may provide a solution to the real-world problem (Lesson 1.6).
__label__0 Algebraic Videogame Programming  Bootstrap is a FREE curriculum for students ages 12-16, which teaches them to program their own videogames using purely algebraic and geometric concepts.  Our mission is to use students' excitement and confidence around gaming to directly apply algebra to create something cool.  We work with schools, districts and tech-educational programs across the country, reaching hundreds of students each semester. Bootstrap has been integrated into math and technology classrooms across the country, reaching thousands of students since 2006.  Programming. Not just writing code.  Knowing how to write code is good, but it doesn't make you a programmer.  Sure, Bootstrap teaches students a programming language. But most importantly, it teaches solid program design skills, such as stating input and types, writing test cases, and explaining code to others. Bootstrap builds these elements into the curriculum in a gentle way that helps students move from a word problem to finished code.  After Bootstrap, these skills can be put to use in other programming environments, letting students take what they've learned into other programming classes.  Watch the video to hear students, engineers, teachers, and the Bootstrap team describe what excites them about Bootstrap!  Real, Standards-Based Math  Unlike most programming classes, Bootstrap uses algebra as the vehicle for creating images and animations. That means that concepts students encounter in Bootstrap behave the exact same way that they do in math class. This lets students experiment with algebraic concepts by writing functions that make a rocket fly (linear equations), respond to keypresses (piecewise functions) or make it explode when it hits a meteor (distance formula). In fact, many word problems from standard math textbooks can be used as as programming assignments!  The entire curriculum is designed from the ground up to be aligned with Common Core standards for algebra. Bootstrap lessons cover mathematical topics that range from simple arithmetic expressions to the Pythagorean Theorem, Discrete Logic, Function Composition and the Distance Formula. The program is based on cognitive science research and best practices for improving critical thinking and problem solving.  ""  —  Our team  Bootstrap is the creation of Emmanuel Schanzer, M.Ed. (in the hat). After earning a bachelors of Computer Science (Cornell University), he worked in the private sector for a number of years as a programmer (Microsoft, Vermonster, and others) until he switched careers and became a math teacher, starting out in Boston Public Schools. He is now a doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

__label__0 What to learn in pure math for applied math?  What to learn in pure math for applied math?  So I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory  The applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).  I've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.  It really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.  definitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already. a second course in partial differential equations a course in applied nonlinear equations As many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation) a course in linear programming a course in combinatorics maybe a course in control theory  If you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.  Differential Geometry mathematics of Fluid Mechanics mathematics of Quantum Mechanics mathematics of Quantum Field Theory mathematics of General Relativity  If you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,  As many courses in real analysis as possible As many courses in statistics, probability. a second course in numerical analysis. a course in nonlinear optimization a course in mathematical theory of finance.  BTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious coursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.  I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.  If I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity  First of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics. But I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory. So I think overall topology is a good idea if you wanna go for mathematical physics.

__label__0 MA Mathematics Domains of Study  Areas of Study Within the M.A. in Mathematics Education Degree  The WGU Master of Arts in Mathematics Education (K-6, 5-9 or 5-12) program content is based on research on effective instruction as well as national and state standards. It provides the knowledge and skills that enable teachers to teach effectively in diverse classrooms. The M.A. in Mathematics Education program content and training processes are consistent with the accountability intent of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The degree program is focused on the preparation of highly qualified teachers. As described in the federal legislation, a highly qualified teacher is one who not only possesses full state certification, but also has solid content knowledge of the subject(s) he or she teaches.  The following section includes the larger domains of knowledge, which are then followed by the subject-specific subdomains of knowledge.  Elementary Mathematics Education Domain (for the K-6 program)  This domain focuses on the following mathematics content, as well as central issues related to the teaching of these topics in grades K–6:  Mathematics (K-6) Content This subdomain focuses on the following mathematics content with integrated mathematics pedagogy: Introduction to Number Sense; Patterns and Functions; Integers and Order of Operations; Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages; Coordinate Pairs and Graphing; Ratios and Proportional Reasoning; Equations and Inequalities; Geometry and Measurement; and Statistics, Data Analysis, and Probability.  Finite Mathematics This subdomain focuses on the real number system, symbolic logic, number theory, set theory, graph theory and their applications.  Middle School Mathematics Content Domain (for the 5-9 program)  This domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: Finite Mathematics, College Algebra, Pre-calculus, Probability and Statistics I, College Geometry and Calculus I.  Finite Mathematics This sub-domain focuses on the real number system, symbolic logic, number theory, set theory, graph theory and their applications.  College Algebra This sub-domain focuses on equations, inequalities, polynomials, conic sections, and functional analysis including logarithmic, exponential, and inverse functions in problem solvingComprehensive Exam The CYV1 is a comprehensive exam assessing the student's knowledge of the subdomains listed above.  High School Mathematics Content Domain (for the 5-12 program)  This domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: This domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: Pre-Calculus, Probability and Statistics, College Geometry, Calculus and Analysis, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Mathematical Modeling and ConnectionsCalculus II This sub-domain focuses on integration techniques and applications, the solution of differential equations, and the analysis of sequences.  Research Fundamentals Domain (for the K-6 and 5-9 programs)Capstone Project (for the K-6 program)  The Capstone Project is the culmination of the student's WGU degree program. It requires the demonstration of competencies through a deliverable of significant scope that includes both a written capstone project and an oral defense.  Students will be able to choose from two areas of emphasis, depending on personal and professional interests. These two areas include instructional design and research. If carefully planned in advance, the individual domain projects may serve as components of the capstone. For capstones with the instructional design emphasis, students will design, manage, and develop an instructional product for which there is an identified need. The product can be delivered via the medium of choice (e.g., print-based, computer-based, video-based, web-based, or a combination of these), but you must provide a rationale for the medium selected. The instructional product you develop for your capstone should be an exportable form of instruction designed to bring your target audience to a mastery of predetermined knowledge and skills.  For capstones with the research emphasis, students will design and conduct a data-based investigation of a conclusion-oriented question (decision-oriented investigations are most generally considered to be evaluation projects). The project report should be of publishable quality and may be submitted to an appropriate professional journal at the completion of the project. At the minimum you should plan to share your results with your school or organization questions covering the mathematics content domain. The purpose of the exam is a checkpoint to ensure that you have acquired the critically required skills and knowledge specified in the program competencies.  Teacher Work Sample Written Project (for the 5-9 and 5-12 programs)  The Teacher Work Sample Written Project is the culmination of the student's WGU degree program. It requires the demonstration of competencies through a deliverable of significant scope that includes both a written project and an oral defense.  The Teacher Work Sample is a written project containing a comprehensive, original, research based curriculum unit designed to meet an identified educational need. It provides direct evidence of the candidate's ability to design and implement a multi-week, standards-based unit of instruction, assess student learning, and then reflect on the learning process. The WGU Teacher Work Sample requires students to plan and teach a multi-week standards-based instructional unit consisting of seven components: 1) Contextual factors, 2) learning goals, 3) assessment, 4) design for instruction, 5) instructional decision making, 6) analysis of student learning, and 7) self-evaluation and reflection a presentation (typically PowerPoint) and defense of the Teacher Work Sample (TWS). Candidates will be asked to reflect upon the TWS, note its strengths and weaknesses, discuss its impact on student learning, and suggest future improvements. The purpose of the exam is a checkpoint to ensure that you have acquired the critically required skills and knowledge specified in the program competencies.

__label__0 Hi Math Gurus, I have been trying to work out a couple of questions based on cramer's rule. They are a part of our homework in Pre Algebra and are to be submitted in 4 days. Could you please aid us in winding it. We are actually searching for a software that can guide us in getting this done.  You might want to check out Algebra Buster. I bought it some time back to help me with my Algebra 2 course and I can say that it was really a wise decision. There are so many demos given which you can go through. You can also try out the questions related to converting decimals and adding numerators by just typing them in. Algebra Buster provides complete description to the problems which helps to make difficult concepts very clear. I would say that this program is absolutely the best that money can buy.  It is good to know that you wish to improve your math and are taking efforts to do so. I think you should try Algebra Buster. This is not exactly a tutoring software but it offers solutions to math problems in a very descriptive manner. And the best thing about this software product is that it is very user friendly. There are a lot of examples given under various topics which are quite useful to learn the subject. Try it and wish you good luck with math.  I remember having often faced difficulties with function definition, simplifying fractions and cramer's rule. A truly great piece of math program is Algebra Buster software. By simply typing in a problem from workbook a step by step solution would appear by a click on Solve. I have used it through many algebra classes – Basic Math, Intermediate algebra and Pre Algebra.

__label__0 Saxon Math programs are designed and structured for immediate, measurable and long-lasting results. By employing a proven method of incremental development and continual review strategies, each piece of supplementary curriculum provides time to practice, process and learn beyond mastery.  This Math Intermediate 3 Written Practice Workbook contains exercises designed to refresh students' memories, deepen understanding of concepts, shift gears between different types of problems, and see how different math topics are related. (Workbook reprints exercises from the text with space for the student to show their work).

I have found Saxon Math to be very thorough. I have used Saxon 1, 2, 3 and 5/4 now. Thus far, we have been very pleased with the curriculum. It allows me, the teacher to move a quickly or as slowly as the student needs. I am able to use the tests and assessments included in the student workbook to determine where to place the child and to even skip ahead if needed so that valuable time is not spent on things already mastered. The Teachers Manual is able to be reused with other students, but we always purchase a new workbook for each new student. The price of the workbooks are very reasonable.  We used four other math curricula in the course of 15 years of homeschooling. I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding. Saxon Math has helped me while I have been teaching. It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.  We just switched to Saxon month a few months ago. I have a daughter who really doesn't like math. I took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights. ;) ) She surprised me and picked Saxon. It is extremely black and white and not like the colorful books we have used before. She loves it so far and seems to be grasping the concepts. We didn't buy the manipulatives as I had a lot of them at home already (from other math programs we've used.) I can't really give this an excellent review as we are still new into it.  This curriculum was perfect for my sons needs at the moment. He did go through the years worth of work very quickly, but he has a real thirst for math. My son wanted a few math games added to suppliment his text work. It is a good curriculum.

__label__0 Purpose of the course  This course discusses both theoretical and practical aspects of numerical interpolation and approximation. Such techniques form the core of Numerical Analysis and are the basis for solution of many important problems. We review the relevant mathematical theory and show how it can be used to construct practical algorithms. These algorithms are implemented and tested in matlab.  Our focus is on applications to numerical differentiation and integration of functions. However, we also review certain related special topics such as Galerkin and wavelet approximation theory.
__label__0 principal aim of this book is to introduce university level mathematics — both algebra and calculus. The text is suitable for first and second year students. It treats the material in depth, and thus can also be of interest to beginning graduate students.  New concepts are motivated before being introduced through rigorous definitions. All theorems are proved and great care is taken over the logical structure of the material presented. To facilitate understanding, a large number of diagrams are included. Most of the material is presented in the traditional way, but an innovative approach is taken with emphasis on the use of Maple and in presenting a modern theory of integration. To help readers with their own use of this software, a list of Maple commands employed in the book is provided. The book advocates the use of computers in mathematics in general, and in pure mathematics in particular. It makes the point that results need not be correct just because they come from the computer. A careful and critical approach to using computer algebra systems persists throughout the text.

__label__0 Introduction To Precalculus  posted on: 20 Jun, 2012 | updated on: 21 Jun, 2012  In mathematical world, we study different topic, here we will see the pre Calculus introduction. Pre calculus is a topic which comes from the study of motion. It deals with different ideas, areas and volumes, rates of change, the orbits of planets, and infinite sequences. Pre calculus consists of those subjects, skills, and insights which are necessary to recognize calculus. It involves arithmetic, algebra, coordinate Geometry, trigonometry, and, functions. In Pre calculus we study many different type of topics which includes, sets, real numbers, complex numbers, composite and polynomial Functions, trigonometry, limits, vectors, metrics, binomial theorem, and many other topics. Let's understand few basic topic of pre calculus. Set: - We know that Set is a collection of different type of objects which are defined in proper manner. Different types of operation are present in the set that are Union, intersection, complements and Cardinality product. Sets are of different type like Empty set, Universal set, etc. If no element is available in the set then it is known as empty set, and the Sets are present in the universe of conversation are universal set. Empty set is denoted by the symbol '∅' and universal set is denoted by 'U' Real number: - In the Real Numbers all the Rational and Irrational Numbers and whole numbers are present. For example: Whole numbers are (1, 4, 6, 8, 10). Sometime the number 0 is also involved in Whole Number. Rational number – The Rational Numbers are 3/5, 0.16, 0.33…2.2 etc. Irrational number – Irrational numbers are (⊼, √ 3) etc. If we have √ -3, this number is not considered in the category of real number because it contains imaginary value and '∞' and it is not a real number. This is a brief introduction to Precalculus in which we come across few Basic Terms of pre calculus.

FALL 2010 V55.0205 Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and Color Prof. Stroke (Physics) syllabus Color science is an interdisciplinary endeavor that incorporates both the physics and the perception of light and color. It provides an understanding of visual effects that dramatically enhances our appreciation of what we see. The study of color, light, and optics has applications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. We also study the eye as both an optical and an image processing instrument. Topics include how color is classified and measured (colorimetry), how light is produced, how atoms and molecules affect light, how the human retina detects light, and how lenses are used in cameras.  FALL 2010 V55.0209 Natural Science I: Quarks to Cosmos Prof. Gabadadze (Physics) syllabus Modern science has provided us with some understanding of age-old fundamental questions, while at the same time opening up many new areas of investigation. How old is the Universe? How did galaxies, stars, and planets form? What are the fundamental constituents of matter and how do they combine to form the contents of the Universe? The course will cover measurements and chains of scientific reasoning that have allowed us to reconstruct the Big Bang by measuring little wisps of light reaching the Earth, to learn about sub-atomic particles by use of many-mile long machines, and to combine the two to understand the Universe as a whole from the sub-atomic particles of which it is composed.

FALL 2010 V55.0303 Natural Science II: Human Genetics Prof. Rockman (Biology) syllabus We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain unprecedented insights into the role of heredity. Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity.  FALL 2010 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. SuzukiFALL 2010 V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.  FALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy.  SPRING 2011 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Bailey (Anthropology) syllabus An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.  SPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. HawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.  SPRING 2011 V55.0314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology) syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.  Texts and Ideas  Note: Previously listed as Conversations of the West  Fall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus "One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness…" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our "human" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the "soul," "society," politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's "Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's "The Animal that therefore I am," selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Fall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Spectatorship—Ethics, Politics, Aesthetics Prof. Harries (English) syllabus Are you responsible for what you see? Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Throughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds. These thinkers will, in turn, challenge us to think about the function of images in the present. Readings and films: Plato's Republic, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Rousseau's Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.  FALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What do we need to function as citizens of a democracy--capacities of reason, imagination, or eloquence? Skills in analyzing public discourse or habits of historical memory? Is belief in God required, or particular emotional tendencies or sympathies? What kind of humanistic values, if any, can and should a democracy promote? We examine these questions on the assumption that intensive close reading (and listening, in Mozart's case) promotes the habits of engaged, articulate talking and writing that are the bedrock of civic education. Music of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.  FALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Bolduc (French) syllabus Explores how books give shape, meaning, and purpose to the world and human experience. As it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed. Grouped under four main themes--epic and the human experience, tales of beginnings and ends, battles for truth, writings of the self--we consider the purpose of this conversation between writers of different epochs and its relevance for understanding our own culture. Reading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.  FALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Garrett (Philosophy) syllabus All animals live, but only human beings consider how to live; and only reflective human beings deliberate among different ways to decide how to live. Should one look for guidance to tradition, to religion, to the state, to nature, to feeling, to reason? Versions of this question were raised and addressed repeatedly and with urgency in both Antiquity and the Enlightenment. We examine some of the most important and influential attempts to answer it and some of the dialogue that such attempts have had with one another. Readings include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Greek tragedy and philosophy, Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Wollstonecraft.  FALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.  FALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Calhoun (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, faith, ethics, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.  FALL 2010 V55.0412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way.  Note: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.

SPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative and Western Thought Prof. Weiler (Law) syllabus Issue of justice and injustice and other normative concerns. Each week pairs a core reading from the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament with another work in the Western tradition to explore a broad range of complex normative issues. Often God will be "on trial:" Was the Deluge genocide? Is Abraham guilty of attempted murder and child abuse? Was Jesus guilty as charged? Was Socrates? The themes are all of relevance to contemporary issues: communal responsibility vs. individual autonomy, ecological crisis, ethics vs. religion, freedom of speech and thought, genocide, rule of law and civil disobedience, the Other, punishment and retribution, religious intolerance, sanctity of human life, sex and gender. The course will be taught at the Law School in Law School style—rigourous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Primary readings include: Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology; Xenophon's Apology; Sophocles' Antigone; selections from Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Kierkegaard, Mill, Thoreau, Kafka, Camus.  SPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Free Will in Western Thought Prof. Krabbenhoft (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus The freedom of the human will has been a foundational premise of Western civilization from the early centuries of the Christian era to the present, and yet it has been questioned and even rejected by some of the most influential thinkers of the modern period. We look at the sources of the modern debate in passages from the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, in key texts by Augustine, Luther, and Erasmus, and in the shift toward a deontological view in Kant, Schopenhauer, and nineteenth-century materialism. From this historical overview we move to contemporary theories of freedom and determinism, as well as a discussion of the intersection of neuroscience and the philosophy of free will, and read a number of literary texts in the light of theory: Sophocles' Philoctetes, Tirso de Molina's Trickster of Seville, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco.  SPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Literature in Wonderland Prof. Momma (English) syllabus How to Play with Language: We use language every day, and yet we do not seem to know exactly how it works. Communicating with others through language sometimes feels like playing a game. But does this mean we have only one language game to play, or that we follow only one set of rules all the time? Just like Alice, who was constantly frustrated by the logic of the inhabitants of Wonderland, we are often baffled by difficulties in communicating even the simplest idea. We explore issues on language that may be raised by reading literary and philosophical texts written by "language-conscious" authors: Is language the only way to communicate? Do we know anything about the origin of language? Do grammar and rhetoric help us communicate well or persuade others? Do etymology and the history of English tell us anything new about the language we know already? Do our minds work exactly the same way regardless of the language we speak? How do we do things with words? Readings: Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Plato's Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Beowulf, Chaucer's House of Fame, Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Borges' Library of Babel, Achebe's Things Fall Apart.  SPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom—freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind—as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.  SPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Mortal and Immortal Questions Professor Mitsis (Classics) syllabus A wide-ranging selection of works that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about the nature of religion, the successes and failures of rational argument, the justification of social and political obligations, the benefits and dangers of technology and scientific knowledge, and the value of emotions and our attachments to others. Throughout the semester, students have the opportunity to become more practiced in formulating moral, political, and aesthetic arguments and in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude, that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death--or, perhaps, worse, faced with eternal life. Readings: Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Epicureans, Stoics, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Augustine, Teresa of Avila, Hume, d'Holbach, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Tolstoy, Freud, Proust.  SPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the "Judeo-Christian" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition—science and technology—rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau.  SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French) syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and Rêveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's "What is Enlightenment?"  SPRING 2011 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology) syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.  Cultures and Contexts  Note: Previously listed as World Cultures  FALL 2010 V55.0502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An "Islamic society" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority—some 60%—of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country.  FALL 2010 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities.  FALL 2010 V55.0506 Cultures and Contexts: Chinese and Japanese Traditions Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus Essential aspects of Asian culture—Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.  FALL 2010 V55.0509 Cultures and Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today.  FALL 2010 V55.0514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.  Fall 2010 V55.0515 Cultures and Contexts: Latin America Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus Spanish, African, and Amerindian Sources of Latin American Identities. Explores the emergence of contemporary Latin America through the past and present doings of its persons and their representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature. Through in-depth treatment of selected cases, and via the perspectives of history, anthropology, and cultural criticism, focusing on texts but also film, dance, music, and performance, the aims is both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness (and of global modernity) in the historical confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of death in the Day of the Dead, and "Indian" saints whose processions are associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national integration. At base, we seek to answer more fundamental questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of so-called globalization? Includes frank and explicit discussion of race, sex, and religion.  FALL 2010 V55.0534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus A range of intersecting questions concerning the African Diaspora and what it produces: What does the trans-Atlantic slave trade create in the early modern and modern world? How is our understanding of trade, culture, capitalism, justice, race, gender, and work shaped by the histories of dispersal that characterize the Atlantic World? What aspects of culture, politics, identity, and social formations are illuminated when we think critically about the African Diaspora and the forces that propel it?  FALL 2010 V55.0537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel—Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.  FALL 2010 V55.0539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian Pacific American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions-films, literature, art, media, and popular culture.  Fall 2010 V55.0541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish & Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of "Latin American" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the "age of encounter," including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts.  FALL 2010 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Morris (ISAWFALL 2010 V55.0546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.  SPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Hull (History) syllabus Focuses on several major African cultures that influenced each other's development from the pre-colonial through the postcolonial eras. These multi-dimensional cultures are examined through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, and museum artifacts, with emphasis on concepts of cultural identity and interchange, modernization, and cosmopolitanism. Africa is examined not only within the context of indigenous cultures but within the context of the world at large. In this vein, we weigh the contributions African cultures made to each other but also to the wider world.  SPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Beidelman (Anthropology) syllabus Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.  SPRING 2011 V55.0507 Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Solt (History) syllabus Postwar Japan, 1945 to Present. An inquiry into Japan's social, political, and economic transformation since World War II. Examines the role of the Cold War, the U.S. Occupation, the "Peace" Constitution, the symbolic monarchy, the economic "miracle," corporate structure, the gendering of labor, and the legacy of war in shaping the history of postwar Japan. An underlying theme is the connection between political economy and culture. As such, we focus on the geopolitical and economic structures underpinning the visible transformations in everyday life and try to connect these transformations in Japanese history to broader themes in global history.  SPRING 2011 V55.0510 Cultures and Contexts: Russia—between East and West Prof. Borenstein (Russian & Slavic Studies)syllabus What is Russia? What does it mean to be "Russian"? These questions have troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West), or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very beginnings to the present day.  SPRING 2011 V55.0512 Cultures and Contexts: China Prof. Button (East Asian Studies) syllabus However one might choose to define the nature of human being, no one is ever merely human. Apart from whatever common essence we may be said to share, we are always also a combination of racial, ethnic, national, and gender differences. Over the course of several millennia Chinese culture has produced different conceptions of human being. We explore the variety of ways those conceptions have changed over time. Central to our inquiry is the question of how contending visions of the human are expressed and contested in different kinds of philosophical and literary texts, as well as artistic works in other media, including visual culture and film. Our guiding focus is on how ideas about human being in China have shaped gender roles and relations, the discourses of spirituality and the supernatural, as well as modern problems of race, nationalism, and revolution.  SPRING 2011 V55.0516 Cultures and Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology) syllabus Utilizing a variety of sources—novels, films, and academic scholarship—students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily.  SPRING 2011 V55.0529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Rosaldo and Prof. Gaytan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Addresses immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, testimonials, identities, popular culture, and language. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws on readings from imaginative literature to social science, we explore Latino communities in the United States and the issues that divide and unite them.  SPRING 2011 V55.0533 Cultures and Contexts: Iran Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran: For 2500 years, the culture and civilization of Iran, (known in the West prior to World War II as Persia), has survived innumerable attacks and vicissitudes, which swept away many other cultures, languages, and nations. The first empire in human history to be multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious, based on tolerance, expanded ultimately to encompass all the lands from the Hindu Kush to North Africa. Emphasizing the growth of ancient Iranian culture--particularly art, architecture, literature, and their influence--we investigate the traditional myths and religions of ancient Iran, the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness, the establishment of Shi'i Islam as the state religion, and the conflict of the vision and mysticism of traditional Iranian culture with that of the West. We survey the political organization of the Empire, Alexander the Great's conquest of Iran and its aftermath, and the impact of the Arab-Islamic conquest. We examine the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness after World War II, and the transformation of the country during the Islamic Revolution.  SPRING 2011 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic StudiesSPRING 2011 V55.0549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History) syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond.  Expressive Culture  FALL 2010 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses0751 Expressive Culture: Television Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus The Twilight Zone and Expressive Culture of the 1950s and 1960s. According to cliché, the 1950s in America were a period of conformity and consensus, but it is clear that there were many signs of discontent with and within the image of cheerful homogeneity. For example, at the end of the decade, the television program The Twilight Zone, showed everyday life as a source of paranoia in which ordinary existence revealed its frightening underside. Then, as the nation engaged with the New Frontier of the Kennedy 1960s, the show used science fiction to represent dreams as American nightmares. We look at The Twilight Zone in terms of its expressive rendition of 1950s and 1960s America. Along the way, we examine the shift in American television from East Coast production of liberal drama to West Coast production of escapism and entertainment and will situate Rod Serling's career within that shift. We also examine other renditions of paranoia (and symbolic resolutions of it) across the popular culture and politics of the moment. Most broadly, we attempt to examine the medium of popular television as an expressive cultural form which enlightened liberals like Serling tried to use as a mode of moral and aesthetic uplift. Critical methods that might help us understand the potentials of television as expressive culture are emphasized.  SPRING 2011 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.  Spring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. Zayaruzny investigateSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. MuellerSPRING 2011 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75, considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in American society. Examines developments in film genre during this period especially in relation to political and cultural change. Narrative innovations are emphasized, with special attention to the specificity of film form and style (e.g., editing, mise-en-scène, sound). Provides an introduction to the methods and principles of film analysis as well as dealing with this period of filmmaking in depth. Includes films by Kubrick, Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese.  Study Abroad at NYU Global Sites  Spring 2011 V55.9549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU in London) syllabus The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.  Spring 2011 V55.9505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Adams (NYU in Ghana) syllabus African culture through autobiography. Texts consist of chronological life histories and memoirs, e. g., by writers of aristocratic birth and those of peasant birth, by individuals accomplished in the arts and others in the sciences, by Nobel laureates and by political leaders, by women and by men. Each narrative provides an intimate acquaintance with the traditions, aspirations, challenges, and strategies from the writer's own society. Collectively they provide the skeleton of a usefully subjective narrative of modern African history. The depicted lives include an 18th-century enslaved Nigerian child, who, ultimately, as a free man, would become a respected abolitionist; the U.S.-educated leader of Africa's first nation to gain independence from colonialism; the passionate Kenyan crusader for the preservation of Africa's environment as the source of its self-development; and the physically and morally courageous exemplar of the battle that overthrew South African apartheid.  Spring 2011 V55.9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain—At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Galban (NYU in Madrid) syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain—the idea of Spain—that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain's New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933–36). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.  Spring 2011 V55.9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multicultural France Prof. Epstein (NYU in Paris) syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, "race," identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of "ethnic community" so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the "homogeneity" of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and "primitive" art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, négritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas.  Spring 2011 V55.9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague—In the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU in Prague) syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world's richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.  Spring 2011 V55.9537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Emmerich (NYU in Tel Aviv) syllabus Explores various aspects of the production of everydayness in Israel as it is manifested in different sites: the arts, the leisure industry, and the spatio-temporal arrangements of daily routines and practices. Given its unique geo-political circumstances and its symbolic position, Israel attracts much media coverage as well as more scholarly treatment of the Israeli-Arab or Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More often than not, Israel is portrayed through the lens of high politics or treated as an exotic anomaly. Whether popular or academic in its orientation, the study of Israeli society has thus tended to neglect everyday life in Israel. We consider aspects of Israeli politics and culture; visit art exhibitions, music venues, and the cinema; and observe street life in Tel Aviv (day and night).

__label__0 Extent:  Availability:  Sample chapters for download  About the book  Mathematics for Year 11 Geometry and Trigonometry 5th edition has been written to embrace the concepts outlined in the Stage 1 Mathematics Curriculum Statement. It is not our intention to define a course.  This package is the first step in a new approach to mathematics education. You are provided with a text book and a CD-Rom which displays the contents of the book plus many exciting new interactive features which will assist teachers and students.  The book is language rich and technology rich. Whilst some of the exercises are simply designed to build skills, every effort has been made to contextualise problems, so that students can see everyday uses and practical applications of the mathematics they are studying.  The book contains many problems, from the basic to the advanced, to cater for a wide range of student abilities and interests. Much emphasis has been placed on the gradual development of concepts with appropriate worked examples. However, we have also provided extension material for those who wish to go beyond Stage 1 and look towards further studies or applications of mathematics for their career choices. It is not our intention that each chapter be worked through in full. Time constraints will not allow for this. Consequently, teachers must select exercises carefully, according to the abilities and prior knowledge of their students, in order to make the most efficient use of time and give as thorough coverage of work as possible.  The extensive use of graphics calculators and computer packages throughout the book enables students to realise the importance, application and appropriate use of technology. No single aspect of technology has been favoured. It is as important that students work with a pen and paper as it is that they use their calculator or graphics calculator, or use a spreadsheet or graphing package on computer.  The interactive features of the CD-Rom allow immediate access to our own specially designed geometry packages, graphing packages and more. Teachers are provided with a quick and easy method of demonstrating concepts, or students can discover for themselves, and revisit when necessary.  Teachers should note that instructions appropriate to each graphics calculator problem are available on the CD-Rom and can be printed for students. These instructions are written for Sharp, Texas Instruments, Casio and Hewlett-Packard calculators.  In this changing world of mathematics education, we believe that the contextual approach shown in this book, with the associated use of technology, will enhance the students' understanding, knowledge and appreciation of mathematics.

__label__0 At Lawrence North High School, the entire hand-picked team of Algebra 1 instructors believes passionately that mastering these skills and concepts will have a stronger influence on your future success throughout high school and beyond than any other single course in which you may choose to enroll. Algebra 1 skills and conceptual relationships are the foundation of the CORE 40 graduation exam but will also prepare you for future math and science courses. We are committed as a team to providing quality instruction and appropriate materials and supporting you with plenty of attention, patience, and other resources. We understand the importance of the content of this class and we truly want you to succeed.  Some of the "big ideas" we emphasize in Algebra 1 include properties of real numbers, solving equations and inequalities and proportions, functions and graphs, understanding lines and slope, polynomials and factoring, radicals and quadratic functions.  Our measuring sticks are that darn CORE 40 test and your future success in Algebra 2, but our focus is on mastering those "big ideas" along the way. Some of these skills will be difficult for you to understand at first. I encourage you to keep these three P's in mind:  1)Practice! Math is a skill and can only be mastered through routine,  rigorous and disciplined practice.  2)Pace! Don't try to rush or skip ahead until you fully understand what we have already done.  Take breaks and ask lots of questions.  3)Perspective! This class is imperative regardless of your goals. I encourage you to  take a step back from the mechanical steps of the arithmetic and try to understand  the concepts and relationships. When you understand why certain steps are required  Congratulations! You made it to the second semester of Algebra 1. Only the students who have demonstrated a solid understanding of the concepts in the first semester are here right now. Yes, it's that important. The second semester is notable more difficult than the first, but we're confident you'll make it through or it would not have been recommended that you be here. We have two goals this semester: 1) to make sure everyone is prepared for the Algebra 1 End-of-Course Assessment (ECA) graduation exam in May, and 2) to help ensure your future success in Algebra 2.  Our seventh unit explains the rules for exponents and multiplying and dividing factors with the same base. We'll follow that up with a unit on polynomials to get comfortable adding and subtracting like terms with exponents, then multiply polynomial groups together using the Distributive Property. In the next unit we will change directions and go backwards through the distributive process to factor polynomial expressions, especially quadratic trinomials. As the quarter draws to a close, we'll be breaking down and solving quadratic equations.

__label__0 The following is a summary of main duties for some occupations in this unit group:  Mathematicians conduct research to extend mathematical knowledge in traditional areas of mathematics such as algebra, geometry, probability and logic and apply mathematical techniques to the solution of problems in scientific fields such as physical science, engineering, computer science or other fields such as operations research, business or management.  Statisticians conduct research into the mathematical basis of the science of statistics, develop statistical methodology and advise on the practical application of statistical methodology. They also apply statistical theory and methods to provide information in scientific and other fields such as biological and agricultural science, business and economics, physical sciences and engineering, and the social sciences.  Actuaries apply mathematical models to forecast and calculate the probable future costs of insurance and pension benefits. They design life, health, and property insurance policies, and calculate premiums, contributions and benefits for insurance policies, and pension and superannuation plans. They may assist investment fund managers in portfolio asset allocation decisions and risk management. They also use these techniques to provide legal evidence on the value of future earnings.

__label__0 High School Workshops  (1997 – present)  These day-long workshops, held on the University of Arizona campus, are designed for high school classes. (We also occasionally hold workshops designed for middle school classes, as well as workshops geared specifically towards school teachers.) The workshops cover topics that are not commonly taught in school math classes. Through an intuitive approach to each subject, students are exposed to both interesting and active areas of contemporary mathematics research.  A secondary purpose of the high school workshops is to expose high school students to what an undergraduate education in mathematics includes, and to encourage them to add math classes to their schedule when they enter college.  If you are a teacher interested in bringing your class to a workshop, please contact the current program coordinator (see below).  Workshop topics  Listed here are past workshop topics. We are always open to ideas for new topics.  Introduction to Fourier Series and Harmonic Analysis  Advanced topics in Fourier Series and Harmonic Analysis  Introduction to Cryptology  Public Key Cryptography and Digital Signature Verification  Factoring and Primality Testing  Introduction to Quantum Mechanics  Einstein's Way Cool Notion of Motion  Elasticity and Bridge Design  Rate of Change and Functions  Probability and Game Theory  The symmetric road to the Rubik's Cube  Knot Theory  Graph Theory  Biomathematics  Additional information on particular workshops (topic descriptions, dates, and participants) is available at various workshop-related websites:  Current program coordinator  History and Participants  Workshops in this outreach program are organized and run entirely by graduate students (with faculty encouragement and departmental administrative support). The program came into existence in Spring 1997 as one aspect of the SWRIMS project, when SWRIMS director Dr. William Vélez suggested this outreach program—and allocated SWRIMS funding—to graduate students Jennifer Christian-Smith, Aaron Ekstrom, and Alexander Perlis. (SWRIMS had already been involved in high school workshops on Population Biology and Honey Bees, which were organized by Dr. Joseph Watkins.)  Initially, graduate student program coordinators and workshop organizers were funded by SWRIMS. Since around 2000, the primary incentive for graduate student participation has been the vertical integration requirement for graduate students funded by the department's VIGRE Grant.

__label__0 This book explains, as clearly as possible, tensors and such related topics as tensor products of vector spaces, tensor algebras, and exterior algebras. You will appreciate Yokonuma's lucid and methodical treatment of the subject. This book is useful in undergraduate and graduate courses in multilinear algebra.  Tensor Spaces and Exterior Algebra begins with basic notions associated with tensors. To facilitate understanding of the definitions, Yokonuma often presents two or more different ways of describing one object. Next, the properties and applications of tensors are developed, including the classical definition of tensors and the description of relative tensors. Also discussed are the algebraic foundations of tensor calculus and applications of exterior algebra to determinants and to geometry. This book closes with an examination of algebraic systems with bilinear multiplication. In particular, Yokonuma discusses the theory of replicas of Chevalley and several properties of Lie algebras deduced from them.  Readership  Graduate students as well as experts in theoretical and mathematical physics, differential and integral equations and mathematical analysis.  Reviews  "This book provides a well-organized introduction to tensors and related topics and could be useful for students of different levels (including Ph.D. level). The author includes a number of exercises at the end of each chapter."

This is the larger Module and accounts for 40% of your final mark and Grade. Your tier of entry on this Module determines your final tier of entry. Please note your tutor will determine your level of entry for this Module.  Assessment Methods:  For Unit 1, the assessment is managed through 1 x 1-hour written paper; you are expected to use a calculator for this paper. You will sit this exam in Spring 2013 on one weekday. The date and time will be confirmed for you on course. Unit 2 is assessed through one written paper which is for 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is a non-calculator paper and will be scheduled during June 2013. Unit 3 is assessed through a 1 hour and 30 minute paper. Each unit exam is scheduled on a separate day in June 2013. You will have the option of re-sitting Unit 1 in June 2013. Your tutor will discuss this option with you as appropriate.  Additional Information:  You should be aware that although this is a Foundation Tier course, we only deliver material up to Grade C. Because of the limited time available to deliver a wide ranging and complex syllabus, we will spend time in the class concentrating on the material which will enable you to achieve a High Grade up to C. Please be aware that there is a significant level of commitment required of you in order to successfully complete this course.  If you would like more information on course fees and how to get additional help to pay for them, please click here  Bring To First Class:  You will need the following equipment: • Writing pad and selection of pens • Mathematical tool kit • New GCSE Maths AQA Modular Student Book Foundation 1 by Brian Speed et al, published by Collins ISBN 9780007340126 • New GCSE Maths AQA Modular Student Book Foundation 2 by Brian Speed et al, published by Collins ISBN 9780007340164. • Scientific calculator – preferably one of the Casio FX series which will cost in the region of c£9.00 – though if you already have a Scientific calculator, it should suffice for the course. Please discuss this with your tutor.  You need to bring these resources with you to each session unless directed by the tutor.  Attendance:  Regular attendance is important. We also ask that you are punctual for each session. You should also be aware that the examinations linked to this course are a compulsory aspect of the course. When you sign the learning agreement with the college you are agreeing to attend each week, be punctual and sit the examinations. Please see FAQs.  Further Study and Career Opportunities:  GCSE Maths at Grade C is an entry requirement for a significant number of HE courses and in particular Teacher Training courses. It is also a qualification required and sought by a significant number of employers.  How to Enrol:  Please ensure you have fully read this information sheet first.  This course needs tutor approval before you can enrol.  You will need to complete an Application Form and email it to iag@racc.ac.uk  The Information, Advice and Guidance team (IAG team) will contact you to arrange an interview.  If you are aged between 16-18 please complete the Young Person's Application Form and return it to (fern-chantele.carter@racc.ac.uk)  Frequently Asked Questions:  "How much homework will I need to do outside of class?" You should allow at least 6 hours per week outside of class time to concentrate on homework. This will include research and preparing assignments. This course is continuous, and each week the tutor will progress through the material which comprises the syllabus. Because of the demands of the course, there is limited time for the tutor to spend on each topic. This is why it is important for you as a learner to keep up with the homework and to work as a pro-active learner in the classroom; contributing in a positive and constructive manner and asking questions when you are unsure. Your tutor will collect, mark and return your homework to you with comments to help and guide you with your study.  "What will happen if I miss a class? You should endeavour to attend all sessions. However, if you are unable to attend the tutor will make the materials available through MOODLE. We will also encourage you at the start of the course to work with another learner and ask him/her to be a study buddy; someone in particular whose notes you can copy on your return and who will collect materials from the tutor for you when you are absent.  "When will the exams take place?" The examinations are scheduled to take place in June 2013. The Modules are examined through non-calculator based and calculator based written papers. These examinations are run by the college on prearranged days and times. These dates and times are set by a range of external bodies and as such are non-negotiable. The examinations are normally scheduled on a week day and as such you may need to make arrangements with work or family for these days. Your tutor will inform you of these dates as early as possible on the course to enable you to make any necessary arrangements. The examinations will take place in the college. It is your responsibility to ensure that you arrive on time with the necessary Mathematical tools you need as well as current and valid identification.  "Is there any tutorial support on the course?" No. However, the college does offer a Revision course which is scheduled in Term 3. There are also Mock Examination Days scheduled in Term 3. These additional courses will further support you in your preparation for the final examinations in June 2013.  If you have declared a specific learning difficulty/ disability, you will be offered an interview with our additional learning support co-ordinator, who may arrange 1:1 tutorials with a learning support tutor, or other support.  Outside of your class time, contact time with the course tutor is minimal. Material will be uploaded onto our online learning environment, MOODLE, and you should use this platform to communicate with the tutor and other learners during the course. This will be discussed with you at the start of your course. Access to a computer outside of class time would be an advantage.  "But I am no good at Maths!?" If you meet the entry criteria, then that is a good start! However, you need to have the interest and drive (motivation) to succeed. A significant number of people can succeed, and indeed have succeeded in previous years, on this course even though they thought the same. This is largely because they needed the qualification (a High Grade C or better in GCSE Maths) to gain entry onto another qualification. In other words they had a reason to work and succeed on the course. If you have a particular goal in mind, then although you may not like or be confident with Mathematics, you will succeed if you keep this goal in mind and work through the year as directed by your tutor.  "What if I want to do the course but not take the exams?" Please do not enrol. This course is available to you free of charge and in this format because of the support from the SFA who are the funding body for the college. They expect us to ensure that all candidates who enrol onto the course do so knowing that the summative examinations are integral to the course. In other words, they expect you to take the examinations as part of the course. Further to this, if you enrol but do not take the examinations you are regarded in the eyes of the SFA and therefore the college as a failure and this can have an adverse effect on our results data (statistics) for the year which in turn affects our funding and the provision we can plan to offer. So it is important that you realise, before you enrol, that there is a significant level of commitment expected of you on this course. If you are interested in developing your Mathematics skills and knowledge without having to face the pressure of these GCSE examinations, you may wish to consider a SfL Entry Level Numeracy course. Please read the course descriptors for these courses on the college website.  "What if I have achieved a Grade C before and I now need a Grade B or higher?" This course is not suitable for you. You should consider a GCSE Maths Higher Tier course.

__label__0 MATH32012 Commutative Algebra - 2012/13, Semester 2  Online Test  The Online Test is currently accessible via the MATH32012 course content page in Blackboard. You may retake the test for revision purposes (e.g., to practise the computation of Gröbner bases). It will not affect your coursework mark. (The coursework marks have been finalised and are available via the Grade Centre in Blackboard.)  Module description and prerequisites  You should have general facility for dealing with algebraic structures: complex numbers, sets, groups, rings, fields. For this reason, MATH20212 Algebraic Structures 2 is a prerequisite.  About the course  Many find MATH32012 Commutative Algebra the most advanced abstract algebra course they take as part of their degree. Nevertheless, the content of the course is not just a sequence of theorems and proofs. You are expected to learn methods of algebraic computation relating to polynomials in several variables.  Solving equations has been a driving force of algebra at least since the Babylonians learned to solve quadratic equations some 3700 years ago. The subject matter of this course is, however, informed by more recent developments.  The work of Hilbert in late 19th - 20th century was key to the modern treatment of multivariate polynomials and provided a basis for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. His result that every (consistent) system of polynomial equations over an algebraically closed field has at least one solution is known as the Nullstellensatz. But an efficient method of finding such solutions by elimination was not found until 1965, when Buchberger invented Gröbner bases.  In the course, key theorems about the ring of polynomials in several variables will be rigorously proved. Algorithms relating to polynomials will be explained and supported by examples. This includes factorising polynomials into irreducible factors and computing a Gröbner basis of an ideal.  Results and methods of Commutative Algebra have applications in various branches of mathematics and computer science. Here are some puzzles which we may use in the course as an illustration for the main content. You are welcome to have a go at solving them!  Question 1 (Fermat, 17th century). Find all integers a "sandwiched" between a square and a cube.  Question 2. How many ways are there of placing 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other? What about n queens on an n×n chessboard?  Question 3. How many distinct Sudoku boards are there? (A Sudoku board is a 9×9 square with a number from 1 to 9 in each cell, satisfying the Sudoku constraints.)  images from Wikimedia commons  Coursework  There will be 2 pieces of assessed coursework:  Assessed homework 1 (see a link above): a take-home problem sheet set on Wednesday 27 February (week 5), due on Tuesday 12 March (week 7) at 4pm.  Blackboard-based online test: a timed, open-book test which the students complete online; multiple attempts are allowed  Previous years' exams  Commutative algebra exam papers from years 2008-2012 are available here.

The course is cross-listed as both a biology and biomedical engineering class.  "I've previously taken regular calculus classes with engineers and wondered what would the classes ever be useful for," said Kate Coyle, a biology major who completed the Dynamics class and graduated this semester. "Labs I've had in biology and physics show you the protocol and the expected result.  "This is not the same, at all. We were solving real problems every day."  Students work through problems using an online interactive textbook, Dynamics of Biological Systems: A Modeling Manual Chiel wrote and the computer programming language Mathematica, which scientists worldwide rely on to build mathematical models of complex systems. Chiel's book is available free to students as well as teachers who may want to use it as is or as a model for their own classes.  When teams become stuck on a problem, ,Chiel or a teaching assistant makes suggestions, gives clues and tries to coax out the answer. After success, teachers quiz individuals about how they found the solution and what they'd learned.  The class of 30 is spread out among hexagonal tables. Teams power up their laptops and go to work. Each day the teachers rotate to a different group of students, and after each class they compare notes on who has mastered the skills and who needs extra help, Gill said.  When the second half of the semester begins, teams choose a mathematical model that was recently published in a scientific journal, begin reconstructing and analyzing it and then writing in detail what they learn. The students then extend the model to answer new questions that they ask themselves, and write up results as if they were writing for a scientific journal.

__label__0 Book summary  The text presents a circular function approach to trigonometry by demonstrating connections between the familiar algebra and the new language of trigonometry. This method-along with foreshadowing-is used throughout the text to provide students with a comfortable base for learning something new from something old or familiar. With just a few connections to algebra, students have the tools to understand the circular functions, their domains and ranges, and the relationship between the circular functions and the functional values. The approach immediately launches the student into the concept of periodic functions, their applications, graphs, and use in modeling many periodic phenomena. Beginning with this approach provides the student with a common thread that can be used to discover, connect and understand the remaining concepts of trigonometry. [via]

__label__0 Ok you people out there that want the easy way out in your geometry, algabra, and pre-calc class i got a math program for you that does most of what you need for these classes. ne thing from: Area, surface area, volume, cramers rule, Conics, distance formula, end behavior, midpoint, pascals triangle, quadratic formula, reducing radicals, and slope. It runs right out of the program menu, or if you really want to be secretive, it works under mirage (which can hide it from teachers) I was hoping to sell it for like 2 bucks....but don't know if it will work that way... but if you want it..email me and i'll give it to you for free  Because I like to help people learn programming and stuff, I have setup a few yahoo groups where people can learn from me/eachother, share files/programs, post messages, etc. - Trust me, I am among the best, so I think it would be very beneficial.  I am very willing to teach people everything I know whenever I have free time (I like to work on a one-to-one basis). Check out my groups if you are at all interested or curious.  Below are the web addresses for my groups (CAREFUL, I had to put a space after each slash, so if you copy and paste, delete the spaces):  You could try searching for one first. For example, you could probably find one or more in 83plus/basic/math (such as baseic.zip or bases.zip) or in 83/basic/math.  I don't want to sound rude or condescending, but you really should look first for what you want before you ask someone to do something for you. This site especially has most math programs a beginner like you or I would need.  Once you've learned enough and need a program that doesn't exist (at least on ticalc), one should hope that you would have the ability and knowledge to write what you need by yourself or at least to search the many resources available to you on the Internet and other places. This goes for most every beginner, not just you.  I'm not trying to be high and mighty by calling you and others a beginner; I still consider myself to be a beginner in many ways.  hi i am taking AP Calculus. please, i am begging you. someone has to create a super program for this class. it isn't a hard class, but it takes time to solve some stuff. also, a calculus program would save me time in contests. well see you and thanks  A lot of programs calculate everything for you in the background, giving you a final answer. What about a program that gives you the formula? I can't remember formula, and I don't trust values of programs, I'd prefer to just see the formula.  Option 1: If it is Mirage compatible (add a ":" to the beginning of the first line), you simply highlight it in Mirage and press "tan(". To the right, the properties should read either "LOCKED:Y" or "L:Y". Option 2: Send it to your computer (PC or Mac) and open it with 83+ Graph Link. There should be a box next to "Protected". Check the box. If you don't have either of those two programs, e-mail me at SSpyro64@AOL.com  Ok, this is kind of similar. I'm the only person at my school who knows any bit how to program calculators, so, like anyone would do, I sell them. However, lately, people have been giving each other the programs instead of buying them from me. Is there a way to stop people from being able to send programs????  thats pretty underhanded ... but, back to the point if you aren't sending then mirage its easy to send them a shell that can detect hidden progrsms and run them but not unhide them. You can send them the program from mirage so you dont have to unhide it. they will be able to run the program from the shell but if you dont give anyone mirage then they cant send them.

__label__0 The content. Analysis is about the concepts of function, derivative, and integral (quoted from the preface for the Shilov's book). As a starting point in this study we will look into the structure of real line and explore some of the axioms of the real number system.  The primary focus in the initial part of the course will be on the Completeness Axiom and various equivalent forms of it. We will study in detail the concepts of limit, derivative, integral , and the series. Although you have already study all those concepts in your Calculus courses, I am sure that you will realize that there is a lot of room to improve our basic understanding of those concepts. Real Analysis is one of the key courses in the foundations of mathematics, and most of the time in this course will be spent into looking back into the foundations of Calculus. However, we would also like to use our improved understanding of  Calculus to move toward the greater level of abstractions, and to learn something about some of the more "modern" developments of Analysis. In particular, we will study the concept of Metric Spaces a little bit.  1. Program Assessment - Course Objectives Here is a concise list of course goals following the format of Math Department  Assessment Plan. In Section  1  2 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005  Course-level Outcomes. Students shall study foundations of the real number system, limits, continuity, derivative and integral.  Mathematical Reasoning: Students will try to achieve an in-depth understanding of the ideas presented. This includes making sure statements and claims made are checked for accuracy, and an appropriate justification is given.  Problem Solving: A number of calculus problems will be revisited, and many new solved. This course will challenge and develop students' problems solving skills to the limit.  Communication: The main mode of communication in this course will be written (homework, exams). However, in-class participation (oral communication) is essential, as well.  Technology: Use of a Computer Algebra System (Derive, Maxima) and  LATEX.  2. Course Philosophy and Procedure  In order to succeed in this course, you should really immerse yourself totally in doing mathematics. The key strategy in solving problems is "not to give up". This course is truly a problem solving course.  Most of the course time will be spent on limits, derivatives, integrals, ... . You will see again some of the stuff that you are familiar with, but sooner or later you will stumble over some basic stuff that you actually do not know very well.  You should certainly build up on your strengths (the stuff you more or less know), but make sure that you do not neglect working on the weaknesses, as well. Use homework and exams as directions, but you should really guide yourself in the work of filling in the gaps in your knowledge in order to be able to meet the goals set up by the homework and exam problems.  Mathematics is not a spectator sport. It is learned by doing. Viterbo University is striving to be a Learner-centered institution. That entails an expectation of maturity and taking responsibility for their learning on the part of students. I see my job as one helping you succeed in this learning process.  In spite of my best efforts, I may not always manage to say things the way which best leads to your full comprehension. You can also help me by providing as much of a feedback as you can. I will try to do a formal evaluation survey around the middle of the semester. Other than that, I find the questions in class, and especially when someone comes to my office for assistance, very helpful.  As a further assistance to you:  • About a week prior to any exam, you will receive a practice exam which will be, in terms of format and type of problems, very much like the actual exam.  • I am asking you to keep a The Learner's Journal. This is to be a separate notebook that should contain a record of your study/practice on daily basis.  I would also like you to keep a time log - date, hour from-to - for each study session. I would prefer that you use a pen for writing in that journal. If you are going to use pencil, then please do not use erasers, and in any case, do not tear pages out. For a learning to take place, you have to try to do  MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005 3 something. In trying, you are likely to make mistakes. The real learning will start taking place once you start understanding and correcting your mistakes.  You turn that journal in together with your exam, and then you will be graded for the portion of that journal that covers the period preceding that current exam. Up to 30% of the exam score is possible to earn this way.  The elements that will play the key role in grading the journal are  – Organization - readability: In order to evaluate, I have to able to read it first. I should not have a difficult time navigating through those notes.  – Mathematical correctness.  – The quality of the work and the amount of time spent on studying.  • Take-home problems: These assignments should test/help a better integration of material. Some will include more difficult problems. One of those assignments will be a group HW. In general, I encourage you to find some time to study together, but unless stated otherwise, the HW is to be written up on your own.  I will try to space those assignments so that you could have some time to catch up. This should leave significant room for exploring the book on your own, and I encourage you to find your own balance between solving some problems in full, and just sketching solutions to some. You should try to read, meaning to the point where you really understand the question, most of the book problems.  The work in class, your book, HW, and practice exams should give you a pretty clear idea what is that you are expected to learn. It is your job to, perhaps through trial and error, find learning strategies that work best for you. Remember, learning is something you do, rather than something I do to you.  Help. I am used to you asking questions in class, coming to my office, working in groups, asking questions by e-mail. Hope all of that will continue.  There is a growing mount of Internet resources, too. Just go to Yahoo, or Google and search for "real analysis". In particular, you may want to look at  Some of the HW will involve some use of technology (CAS and LATEX). The details will be given later.  One of the writing assignments will be graded in two parts - the second part will require you to come to my office and explain your reasoning, answer some questions.  In all your work, written and oral, it is essential to provide explanations, justify your reasoning.  My grading scale is  A=80%, B=60% , C=40%, D > 30% .  The following exceptions to that scale are possible:  • An A on the final exam (more than 180/200 points) will mean an A for the final grade as well.  4 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005  • If one is passing the course by the time of the final exam, but earns less than 30% points (a score less than 60/200), that will result in an F for the final grade.  3. Some details and examples  Specific Course Goals. To study rigorous foundations of calculus; extend basic knowledge of functions, limits, derivatives and integrals. Students are expected to learn to state definitions and theorems precisely, and be able to prove theorems stated. In particular, the proofs involving the concept of limit are going to be of central importance.  The process of working toward those goals will involve looking back into everything you have learned in mathematics so far, and to subject those concepts to the following key questions:  • What do I really know about ...?  • What does ...mean?  • Is what I just said about ...true?  • How do I know if (why) it is true?  Let me try to clarify this a little bit by looking into an example.  Example: For some Math 155 students, conquering a problem such as  p8 + p32 −  p18 = 3p2  represents a major undertaking; something they consider worth of including into their portfolio for the semester.  Now, when you look at what is involved into justifying the above result, a number of problems present themselves. For example, we have to use the rule  pAB = pApB , A,B 0.  Can you prove that rule?  Another key rule here is  AC + BC = (A + B)C .  How about proving this one It is much more difficult question than one before.  In fact, it is so basic that there is nothing more basic to use as a help in proving it. So, we have to accept that rule as an axiom. Note: I would like to encourage you to read [4, Chapter 4] here!  Moreover, the rules are used by applying them to "existing" mathematical objects (in this case, real numbers). But, what do we mean by p2. Can you prove that such a number exists? What do we even mean by asking a question like that?  The goal of this course is not only to learn how to answer the questions as those (that is how to do certain rigorous proofs), but we would also like to develop the corresponding mathematical awareness, so that we do not overlook those "simple" questions when solving problems.  Ultimately, this kind of training leads to deepening our understanding of what mathematics is about. We would like to use that improved understanding to bring about other two basic goals of this course, which are:  • Move beyond the concepts we are familiar with. We will study the concept of metric spaces.  Fall 1999 - Final. To illustrate the goal of "improving Calculus skills", let's consider the final exam I gave to the Real Analysis class in Fall 1999.  Problem 1. • State the definitions of a lower/upper bound of a set of real numbers.  • State the definition of infimum.  • State the theorem about existence of an infimum of a set bounded below.  • Extra credit: Should I say "the infimum"?  • Prove that the set  S = 3,  5  2,  7  3,  9  4, . . . has an infimum, and find that infimum.  • State the Completeness Axiom.  • Prove that the Completeness Axiom is equivalent to the Infimum Theorem  above.  Problem 2. Define  f(x) =  1Xn=1  n2 + 1  n! xn .  (a) Use the ratio test to show that f is defined for all real x.  (b) Prove that f is continuous at x = 0.  Problem 3. State the definition of the derivative f0(a) of a function f at the point a of its domain.  Use that definition to find the derivative of f(x) = 3x at an arbitrary point of  Df .  Problem 4. Find,  lim  x!0  sin (ln (1 + x))  ln (1 + sin (x)) .  State and prove all the rules used in the process. In the case of L'Hospital's rule, just state it. The proof would be an extra credit.  Problem 5. Probably most of the functions we have encountered so far would be continuously differentiable. That is, if f is differentiable at x = a, then f0 is a continuous function at  x = a.  Is this statement a theorem?  Hint: Show that the function  f(x) = (x2 sin 􀀀1  x , if x 6= 0  0, if x = 0  is a counterexample.  6 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005  A student that has passed a Calculus sequence should have no difficulty in understanding almost all of the questions on that final. Being able to answer them completely is a different matter.  Americans with Disability Act. If

__label__0 Intermediate Algebra, 1e, authored by Sherri Messersmith presents content in bite-size pieces, focusing not only on learning mathematical concepts, but also explaining the why behind those concepts. For students, learning mathematics is not just about the memorization of concepts and formulas, but it is also about the journey of learning how to problem solve. By breaking the sections down into manageable chunks, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle, and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward. Proven pedagogical features, such as You Try problems after each example, reinforce a student's mastery of a concept. While teaching in the classroom, Messersmith has created worksheets for each section that fall into three categories: review worksheets/basic skills, worksheets to teach new content, and worksheets to reinforce/pull together different concepts. These worksheets are a great way to both enhance instruction and to give the students more tools to be successful in studying a given topic. The author is also an extremely popular lecturer, and finds it important to be in the video series that accompany her texts. Finally, the author finds it important to not only provide quality, but also an abundant quantity of exercises and applications. The book is accompanied by numerous useful supplements, including McGraw-Hill's online homework management system, MathZone as well as ALEKS.  MESSERSMITH is rigorous enough to prepare students for the next level yet easy to read and understand. The exposition is written as if a professor is teaching in a lecture to be more accessible to students. The language is mathematically sound yet easy enough for students to understand

__label__0 Edie M. Brown / Academic Therapist  People often say that mathematics is a universal language. It is the essence of cognition - thinking with numbers, imagery, and language. For the people who understand mathematics, the language of numbers turns into imagery, letting them calculate and verify mathematics while seeing its logic. Through multisensory instruction, I integrate all of the senses to help create a mathematical picture of concepts and theories, forming the foundation of understanding.  Mathematics  Math literacy means having the mechanics and skills to perform calculations without looking them up and knowing what situations these skills may be appropriate. The true "math literate" is not someone who can successfully complete a test on recently acquired processes and techniques, but one who can apply those abilities to situations that occur in a variety of situations in the long term.  In secondary and postsecondary math, there should be a broad focus encompassing a wide variety of career choices. This includes common foundations of math ideas and applications. Students should be adept at the integration of mathematical concepts. These areas include algebra, geometry, probability, statistics, calculus, and discrete mathematics.

__label__0 Algebra Unplugged is unlike any math book you have ever read. It explains why algebra problems have to be solved in a particular way. Most textbooks give just a brief introduction to the next set of problems, and then students are expected to complete the practice sets. But how many times has the student (or parent!) not understood what exactly was being asked of them? Understanding the "why" is essential to some children.  The author uses funny, and sometimes odd, comparisons to try to help the student understand the concepts and vocabulary of algebra. I know the author is writing to teens, but some of his comparisons were a little "out there" for me. As the parent of a child with Asperger's who struggles with math, I was glad to have a chance to review this item. I was wondering if it would be able to help him understand algebra a bit better when the time comes in another year or two. I'm going to have to let him be the judge of that. Because he sees things very literally, I'm not sure that he'll understand some of the comparisons.  With more than 250 pages, this book covers any topic you can think of--negative numbers, working with fractions, solving difficult equations, graphing, and much more. If your child needs a little extra help understanding the basic facts of algebra, you may find it helpful to use Algebra Unplugged side-by-side with your chosen textbook. It's often very easy to just "go through the motions" with math and make good grades without understanding what is truly going on, but I don't think that is the best way to learn math. Algebra Unplugged is likely to fill in the gaps for many confused students . . . and probably some parents as well!

In light of this guidance, the study of Logarithmic and Exponential functions plays a very important role in secondary education, particularly in providing a way to model some of the real world problems that students meet outside of the classroom. Such problems are found in diverse places as medicine and finance, as well as, advanced mathematics and politics. More likely than not, if one asked those who studied mathematics in secondary school 25 years ago why they studied exponentials and logarithms, other than to learn about slide rule computation, many would say it was because the topic was a chapter in their textbook that had to be covered. One wonders why something that made a major impact on mathematics four centuries ago became so meaningless to the secondary students of the latter half of the 20th century, the "new math" era. Fortunately, textbooks which embody the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics today reward the student with the theory of exponents and logarithms along with the study of contemporary applications giving meaning to the study. In 1989, the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, which The Principles and Standards for School Mathematics were designed to build upon, were released. The document encouraged that attention be focused "on the need for student awareness of the interaction between mathematics and the historical situations from which it has developed and the impact that interaction has on or culture and our lives" (p.6). There is no doubt that the study of the history of exponents and logarithms is a prime example of how "theoretical mathematics (which) has burgeoned in its diversity and deepened in its complexity and abstraction...has become more ... vital to our technologically oriented society" (p.6). Goals of the Module: 1. To understand the historical background leading to the development of exponents, exponentials, and logarithms and to see how mathematical concepts evolve over periods of time. 2. To provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge of exponents and logarithms to various concrete situations and problems in a historical context. 3. To show students the connection between exponential functions and logarithmic functions, that is the inverse relationship they share with one another. 4. To develop in students an appreciation of the history connected with the development of exponents and logarithms. 4 How to use this module: The authors realize this module contains more material than most teachers can squeeze into an already overcrowded syllabus. It is recommended that the teacher review the material and pick and choose those topics that best fit teacher and students' needs. The material can be made to fit many different types of objectives, and it can be made to fit many different lesson plans. It may even be of interest to teachers of subjects other than mathematics. General historical material may be used for group or whole class discussion. Some quotations and biographical sketches may be more appropriate for introductory material while some are best used within activities. Students should be able to locate the places mentioned on a world map. The written assignments that are required in some of the activities could also include connections with units in social studies, science, economics, etc. If more comprehensive studies are required or desired, the authors have included a bibliography for students and teachers interested in the further study of content in the module. Time Schedule Time needed will depend on the activities and materials the individual teacher chooses to use and the level of the class. The activities may be used to introduce the topic and then further work may be accomplished using exercises found in student textbooks. The teacher is in no way obliged to ask students to perform all these activities; one is not constrained to follow the suggested sequence in which the activities are listed nor to follow the teacher hints. The authors believe that the history will enable students to understand the mathematics better. It is further suggested that the mathematics teacher team teach parts of this module with a history or social science teacher, if such an arrangement can be made. Materials Needed It is highly recommended that the teacher post a world map. Other materials which may be needed in these activities are: machine tape, straightedge, compass, ruler, lined paper, graphing paper, graphing calculator or graphing utility, computers. .Classroom Organization: When using the exploratory activities and projects of this module appears to be the appropriate time to have the class organized into cooperative groups. Using a constructivist approach, the lessons have been created with questions or hints that are designed to guide the student toward "discovering" the relevant results. The quotations of mathematicians may be best presented to the class as a whole on overhead transparencies; copies may be made for personal study by the students. 5 Suggested Courses for Using Module Activities Activity Exponent Notation According to Newton Properties of Exponential Functions Properties of Exponents Compound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase What Will Happen If....?

Lord Moulton, The Invention of Logarithms, Its Genesis and Growth (NTV, 21) The discovery of logarithms is attributed to the Scottish mathematician John Napier; in this section, you will be able to learn about Napier's life, how he formulated the first view of logarithms, and how they were quickly transformed during his own lifetime into something different. The temptation is severe to recast all of Napier's work through the lens of our present interpretation of logarithms, but the actual story is every bit as impressive. Moulton's quote above is useful to keep in mind when we consider the path which Napier took. John Napier was born into an influential and well-to-do family in 1550 in the family estate at Murchiston Castle near Edinburgh, Scotland as the eldest son of Archibald and Janet Napier. Before his death (also at Murchiston) in 1617, he was to become a theologian and an ardent supporter of the Protestant faith, an inventor of weaponry, and an exceptional mathematician. In mathematics, he was known for his work on spherical trigonometry, his invention of an early form of a mechanical calculator, and in particular, his discovery of and work with logarithms. It is also the case that Napier's name was spelled a variety of different ways, including by himself, among them being: Napeir, Nepeir, Neper, Nepper, Naper, Napare, and Naipper. We will adopt the spelling in ordinary usage at the present time. We really know quite little about Napier's early life. It seems he was a student at University of St. Andrews, but he never earned a degree there. He may have traveled abroad, but by 1571 he had returned to the family estates in Scotland where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Stirling in 1572, and after she died in 1579, he married Agnes Chisholm. He had a son and a daughter by his first wife and five sons and five daughters by his second. At this time in Scotland, religious strive was rampant. King James VI of Scotland had designs on the English throne, and there were rumors of the involvement of King Philip II of Spain in those plans. The issue of whether Scotland would become Catholic or Protestant became a widespread concern, and Napier came down very firmly on the side of the Protestants. Scotland suffered through a civil war in 1570-72, and in 1588 the English defeated the Spanish Armada. In 1593 Napier wrote the Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John; to gain a sense of this book, consider the following quote from a letter addressed to King James which formed the dedication: "...let it be your Majesty's continuall study...to reforme the universall enormities of your country, and first...to begin at your Majesty's owne house, familie and court, and purge the same of all suspicion of Papists and Atheists and Newtralls..." (NTV, 42) The book was widely read; between 1593 and 1645 there were 5 English editions, 2 Dutch editions, 5 French editions, and 3 in German. In it, among other things, Napier declared the Pope to be the Antichrist and predicted "that the day of God's judgement appears to fall betwixt the years of Christ 1688 and 1700." 10 There is strong evidence that probably as early as 1594, Napier had begun to investigate certain properties of calculations which would make working with the trigonometric values of sines considerably easier to do in order to facilitate the computations involved in astronomy. The German mathematician Michael Stifel wrote the Arithmetica integra in 1544, and it contained a clear statement relating the arithmetic sequence of integers (1, 2, 3...) with the corresponding geometric sequence of 2 raised to those powers ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 , ...), and this may have suggested the possibility to Napier of using sums to compute products. Stifel even called the powers `exponents' and discussed what we would describe as "when you multiply the numbers, you add the exponents." Napier was also visited by Dr. John Craig, a member of the Scottish royal court, who met had the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1590 and seen some of Tycho's work with prosthaphaeresis. This was a long-known method of using "product to sum" formulas: namely, such trigonometric identities as 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x y). Whatever the impetus, in 1614 Napier published the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) and then posthumously in 1619 the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio (Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) was published. It appears as if Napier wished his work to be as widely accessible as possible, and to this end he aided in Edward Wright's translation of the Descriptio into English in 1616. In this translation he explained that his intent with logarithms was to aid in the calculations involved in multiplication, division, and the taking of roots: Seeing Napier coined the word `logarithm' from the Greek words logos (ratio) and arithmos (number), and his original definition takes some getting used to, compared to our present interpretation of a logarithm. Keep in mind as well that he originally was working strictly with the sines of angles. In proposition 26 in the Constructio he states: "The logarithm of a given sine is that number which has increased arithmetically with the same velocity throughout as that with which radius began to decrease geometrically, and in the same time as radius has decreased to the given sine." (Napier, p. 19) T b g a S i In the figure above, imagine that TS is a line segment of 10 7 units, and that bi is a ray from b. (Napier chose 10 7 for his radius so that he could use values of sines accurate to 7 decimal places but treat them as integers. It is also the case that Napier was one of the first mathematicians to widely use the decimal point as we now write it to separate the integer from the decimal fractional part of a number.) A point g starts at T and moves towards S at a rate 11 equal to its distance from S; at the same time that g starts at T, point a starts at b and moves towards i at the same rate as g's initial velocity. The distance from b to a is then the logarithm of the length from g to S. There are some immediate conclusions that can be reached, stressing the difference from this original view of logarithms and our present perspective. Let Nap. log stand for Napier's definition. First, if g is still at T, then the point a is still at b; therefore, Nap. log 10 7 = 0 and Nap. log is a decreasing function. Second, it can be shown that Nap. log (xy) = Nap. log x + Nap. log y Nap. log 1. Recasting Napier's description in the language of differential equations and x solving, it is possible to demonstrate that Nap. log x = 10 7 log 1 7 ; however, it is critical to 10 e stress that Napier did not interpret his logarithms in anything approaching the modern sense of an exponent for some given base. It may be reassuring to us to solve a differential equation to obtain something more familiar, but Napier's vision clearly did not start there. From the top of the mountain, we can see that Napier's path and our more recent path of regarding logarithms as exponents clearly both get us to the top, but the paths themselves are very, very different. Napier regarded one of the essential properties of logarithms as "the logarithms of similarly proportioned sines are equidifferent." (Napier, p. 23) In other words, for a given k, log (kx) log x = log (ky) log y. This can clearly be considered, in light of the laws of logarithms ky kx which Napier himself knew, as equivalent to log = log . In another interesting side x y note, Napier's proposition 51 states: "All sines in the proportion of two to one have 6931469.22 for the difference of their logarithms." (Napier, p. 38) This statement is closely related to the fact that the natural logarithm of 2 is .693147180. Henry Briggs (1561 1630) was an English mathematician and professor of geometry at Gresham House, London at the time he met Napier; he went on to become the first Savilian professor of geometry at Merton College, Oxford. After having read the Descriptio, he went to Edinburgh in 1615 to meet with Napier. It is somewhat unusual in scientific history, but the two men immediately hit it off and in fact worked with each other until Napier's death in 1617. In 1617 with the publication of Logarithmorum chilias prima and in 1624 with Arithmetica logarithmica Briggs implemented the changes in Napier's logarithmic scheme that he and Napier had considered. Quoting from the preface to the Arithmetica logarithmica: That these logarithms differ from those which that illustrious man, the Baron of Merchiston, must not surprise you...concerning that matter I wrote immediately to the author himself...I journeyed to Edinburgh, where, being most hospitably received by him, I lingered for a whole month. But as we talked over the change in the logarithms he said that he had for some time been of the same opinion and had wished to accomplish it; he had however published those he had already prepared until he could construct more convenient ones if his affairs and his health would admit of it. But he was of the opinion that the change should be effected in this manner, that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and 10000000000 12 that of the whole sine; which I could not but admit was by far the most convenient. (NTV, p. 126) It seems clear that Napier had already begun to consider a more accessible approach to his logarithms, and that Briggs' suggestions helped moved him in that direction. (As Napier himself observed at the end of his table of logarithms in the Constructio: "Nothing is perfect at birth." (Napier, p. 87.)) Since the logarithm of 1 becomes 0, this simplifies greatly the computational algorithms that Napier had already discovered, bringing them in line with our present theorems of logarithms. In the Constructio, an appendix was included "On the Construction of another and better kind of Logarithms, namely one in which the Logarithm of unity is 0." In this, Napier suggested but in fact did not do a revision of his own system, reflecting what he and Briggs had already determined would make computations with logarithms easier. Napier also observed in the Constructio that in this case, "if two numbers with known Logarithms be multiplied together, forming a third; the sum of their Logarithms will be the Logarithm of the third" (Napier, p. 50) (in other words, when you multiply, you add) and went on to state all the other familiar laws of logarithms which we use. He went ahead and then observed "whence the only difficulty is in finding the Logarithms of the prime numbers" (Napier, p. 51). Briggs went ahead with his own work after Napier's death, and the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica contain what is for all intents and purposes the first table of common logarithms i.e., base 10 logarithms. One of the sections of this module discussed how to calculate logarithms somewhat in the method of Napier and Briggs. However, to get a sense of what they went through, consider the following. In constructing his tables, Napier started with the value of his radius 10,000,000 and began successive multiplications of that by 1-10 -7 ; in more modern terms, he generated the terms of a geometric sequence whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -7 . Moulton argues that in performing this process some 100 times, Napier became aware that decreasing a number by the same ratio each time was equivalent to repeatedly decreasing a line segment by the same proportional length, possibly giving rise to Napier's definition of a logarithm. It may have also been the case that through the sheer effort of this work, Napier eventually saw the utility of having (in modern terms) log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 1, but that he needed to go through the tremendous labor of the first construction to reach that conclusion. It is therefore tempting now to claim Napier must have therefore seen that he was constructing a system where the logarithm corresponded to the necessary power of 10 needed to obtain the given number, but that again is our view from the mountain, not Napier's. After working through the first 100 terms (his first table), Napier apparently became aware of the tremendous work left, so he changed to a geometric series whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -5 . He carried this out for 50 more terms, giving a second table. He then created two other series in a third table, one having ratio 1- 1/2000 and one having ratio 1 - 1/100. Using the data he had accumulated with his three tables, he was then able to calculate the logarithm values of numbers from 10 7 to almost exactly 5 x 10 6 . It is small wonder that Napier worked on his tables for 20 years before he published them! In the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs approached the problem differently. He began with log 10 = 1 and then began taking successive square roots, using well-known algorithms for the computations needed for the roots. (For 13 example, if 10 = 3.162277, then log 3.162277 = .5.) Once Briggs obtained the logarithms of the primes, it was easy, using the laws of logarithms, to then generate the values of the logarithms of composite numbers. It may be somewhat astonishing to realize the work required by Briggs to obtain, in Arithmetica logarithmica, the logarithms of all natural numbers from 1 to 20,000 and 90,000 to 100,000, carried out to 14 places. (For example, in his calculations to obtain the logarithm of 2 he took 47 successive square roots.) Adriaan Vlacq a few years later completed Briggs' work and completed a table for all integers from 1 to 100,000 to 10 decimals places. (Until recently, these tables formed the basis of all modern logarithm tables.) Napier also used his idea to construct what were called "Napier's bones", a mechanical multiplication table. Within 7 years, William Oughtred used Napier's ideas to construct the first rectilinear slide rules, basically the first pocket calculator. Some two hundred years after Napier's publication, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace noted that "by shortening the labors, (Napier) doubled the life of the astronomer." Logarithms also present one of the instances when a given discovery must have been in the air; it now seems clear that roughly at the same time Napier was working on his own logarithms, the same essential concept occurred to the Swiss astronomer and watchmaker Joost Brgi (1552 - 1632). While the exact timing of Brgi's work is not entirely clear, he may have in fact worked on the concept before Napier did; however, it is the case that he did not publish his own tables (actually, his were tables of anti-logarithms) until 1620 in Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen. Kepler's statement on the priority issue may be of some interest: "...(this) led the way for Justus Byrgius to the very same logarithms many years before Napier's edition, although this man, a procrastinator and guardian of his secrets, abandoned his child at birth and did not rear it for publicity." (Goldstine, p. 22) Brgi generated the values in his own table by starting with 10 8 and then multiplying by 1 + 10 -4 to obtain the successive terms. The ease with which the discovery of logarithms supported the massive calculations needed for astronomy and navigation generated intense interest among mathematicians. The work of Gregory of St. Vincent and his student A. A. de Sarasa by 1647 made the connection between the natural logarithm of a number a and the area bounded by the x-axis, the vertical a 1 lines x = 1 and x = a (for any a > 0) and the curve y = 1/x, what we would now call dx . x 1 (Natural logarithms are contrasted with common, or Briggsian logarithms by their base. If we use Euler's interpretation of a logarithm as the exponent of a given base, then natural logarithms use the number e = 2.718281828... as their base, while common logarithms use 10.) The Danish mathematician Nicolaus Mercator is usually credited with discovering the formula for the x2 x3 x4 expansion of the natural logarithm of x + 1 as the power series x - + - +... by 1668. 2 3 4 As early as 1664 Newton used this same idea to compute the value of the natural logarithm of 1.1 to 68 decimal places. The ground-breaking work of Newton and Leibniz in the calculus quickly suggested applications of logarithms very far indeed from Napier's original view of the technique. 14 It turned out that the method that was developed to help with computational drudgery held a vital key in the new mathematics of calculus. The logarithm took on a life of its own, separate from the astonishing levels of sheer, brute arithmetic that it both replaced and which were required to establish the first logarithm tables. The logarithm continued to play a major role in computational sciences, but it had already begun to move away from its roots. As the 18th century progressed, mathematicians became increasingly aware of the necessary changes which calculus had brought to the techniques available to them, and also to the changes which were needed in their more basic structures in order to give the methods of calculus a concrete logical base. One of the more central concepts which evolved was that of a `function', namely the ability to regard an operation as the pairing of the number which was to be operated on with the number which resulted from the operation itself. In more abstract terms, it allowed mathematicians to regard the operation as an object itself, more divorced from the immediate numerical relationships. For example, while mathematicians had worked with the numerical relationships expressed in 2 2 = 4, 2 3 = 8, and so forth, they could now consider the relationship between the variables x and y in y = 2 x . This is an example of an `exponential' function, where the variable is the exponent of some positive base. Leonhard Euler, the enormously influential mathematician of the later 18th century, formulated the relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions when he defined log a b = c to be the case if and only if a c = b; therefore, y = a x was equivalent to the statement x = log a y. This was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations. It has provided a gateway into the solutions and analysis of many types of problems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to solve otherwise. An important observation therefore can be made that despite the view of many, both in the past and in present times, mathematics is indeed a changing science. A method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings. Until fairly recently, high school students versed in math and science were given a significant exposure to the computational methods which logarithms opened up and the mechanical devices which logarithms helped create. With the advent of inexpensive hand-held calculators, the computational roots of logarithms have become obsolete, yet the concepts which logarithms have led to continue to be of great utility. We need to be cautious whenever we decide a particular method or approach has reached a dead end; the history of logarithms provides an excellent example of how mathematics grows and develops new relationships for what may appear to be concepts and techniques which have been outgrown, but which can continue to provide important mathematics. It is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined. Vistas open up which are almost unimaginable until you reach the peak, and not only the path up but the ground below takes on a very different appearance. You can marvel at the difficulties of some paths and the ease of others, but it is difficult to not appreciate the sheer 15 effort required along any path to make it to the top, and especially for those who pioneered a particular path. So too it is with the concepts and computations of logarithms; whether it be Napier, Brgi, Briggs, or any of the multitude who followed them, we must continue to remember and appreciate their contributions and exertions. Questions: 1. In Proposition 5 of the Constructio Napier writes "In numbers distinguished thus by a period in their midst, whatever is written after the period is a fraction, the denominator of which is unity with as many cyphers after it as there are figures after the period." (Napier, p. 8) What exactly does this appear to refer to? 2. In Proposition 52 Napier states "All sines in the proportion of ten to one will have 23025842.34 for the difference of their logarithms." (Napier, p. 38) What exactly is Napier saying in modern terms? 3. In an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes "Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c. [or division by 2, 3, & c.]." (Napier, p. 51) Translate the meaning of this statement into more modern terms. 4. In 1617, Napier published the Rabdologi where he described the construction and use of what are now called `Napier's bones' or `Napier's rods'. Find out what these were and what they were used for. 16 John Napier 17 Lesez Euler, lesez Euler, c'est notre maitre a tous. Read Euler, read Euler! He is the master of us all. Pierre-Simon Laplace 1749-1827 18 Leonhard Euler 19 Frontispiece from Euler's Introductio in Analysis Infinitorum 20 Table of Contents from Euler's Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum 21 I soon found an opportunity to be introduced to a famous professor Johann Bernoulli, whose good pleasure it was to advance me further in the mathematical sciences. True, he was very busy and so refused flatly to give me private lessons; but he gave me much more valuable advice to start reading more difficult mathematical books on my own and to study them as diligently as I could; if I cam across some obstacle of difficulty, I was given permission to visit him freely every Saturday afternoon and he kindly explained to me everything I could not understand, which happened with such greatly desired advantage that whenever he had obviated one difficulty for me, because of that ten others disappeared right away, and this undoubtedly, is the best method to succeed in mathematical subjects.

The students may work in groups or individually. If the students need extra time to finish the problems, they could be assigned as homework. It is interesting to read the way that Newton introduced exponents and the terminology that he used. It is also interesting to note that this was part of a lecture Newton gave at Cambridge University - so your students are being exposed to the type of mathematics that was available to university students in the 1680's. An additional assignment would be to have the students write the complete passage in the background information using modern terminology. Bibliography: Newton, Isaac, Arithmetica Universalis, translated by D. T. Whiteside, Cambridge University Press, 1972. 23 Exponent Notation According to Newton Solutions Solutions to questions: 1. 2. If a is a quantity, "If a quantity should multiply itself," means a a. There will be various answers to this. Hopefully most will find it sufficient. The solution to a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3 a2b4 = 42 x 34 = 4 4 3 3 x 3 3 = 1296 It means that the a is to multiplied together 3 times: a a a It means a a a. Since he is naming the powers, like a5 as cube-square, he is adding the powers. So a8 would be square-cube-cube or maybe square-square-square-square. 3. 4. 5. 24 Exponent Notation According to Newton Student Page Historical Background In Sir Isaac Newton's widely read Arithmetica Universalis, many beginning algebraic topics are included. One such topic is that of exponents. This activity comes directly from one of Newton's Arithmetica Universalis, which is a collection of the material covered in his lectures at Cambridge University in England in the 1680's. The following excerpts are from the 1972 translation by D. T. Whiteside from Newton's original Latin. t From page 61: If a quantity should multiply itself, for shortness the number of factors is usually appended. Thus. Here note that a number written immediately between two variables relates always to the preceding one. Thus `3' in the quantity a3b2does not signify the b2 is to be taken 3 times, but denotes that a has twice to be multiplied into itself. Note also that these quantities are said to be of as many dimensions, powers or `dignities' as they comprise factors or quantities multiplying one another, and that the number appended is called the index of their power or dimension. Thus a2 is of two dimensions or powers, while a3, as its appended number `3' indicates is of three. Also a2 is said to be the square, a3 the cube, a4 the square-square (fourth power), a5 the square-cube (fifth power), a6 the cube-cube (sixth power), a7 the square-square-cube (seventh power) and so forth. Exercises 1. Explain what "If a quantity should multiply itself," means. 2. Is the explanation Sir Isaac Newton gave his students in the following enough for you to write terms using exponents? Give your reasons why or why not. Would you be able to evaluate a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3? "Thus." 3. According to Newton what does the `3' in the expression a3b2 mean? 4. What does the phrase "a has twice to be multiplied into itself" mean? 5. Using Newton's method of naming powers, how would he describe the eighth power of a, a8? 25 Properties of Exponential Functions Teacher Notes This activity is a great way to give students the opportunity to graph and observe a variety of exponential functions and then summarize their findings.

Answers will vary, but will be similar to the ones in A through C above. Students might choose negative or zero values for a. If they do, this is a good time to discuss why these values give very strange graphs, graphs which we will usually avoid. In general, in precalculus and calculus classes we generally want to talk just about continuous functions and functions whose inverses are also functions. E. Answers will vary, but will include some of the following observations. All the graphs intersect at the point (0,1). None of the graphs has negative y-values. If a > 0, as z increases, y increases. As a gets larger, the values of y increase faster as z increases. If a < 1, as z increases, y decreases. If a = 1, then y = 1; i.e. the function is constant. If a < 0, the graph jumps back and forth between positive and negative values for y as z increases. F. Answers will vary. Many students will find that their answers include some, if not all, of Euler's observations. 28 Properties of Exponential Functions Student Pages Leonhard Euler wrote the first easy-to-read precalculus book in 1748. First, see how you might figure out properties of exponential functions; then compare your summary to his. Look at a general exponential function, y = a z , and see what happens to the graph as the value of a changes. Use the same scale for all graphs. Also, you may want to use the integers from -3 to 2 for the z-values. The equation uses z instead of x because that is what Euler used. A. Graph y = 2 z and y = 3z using a table of values. z y z y B.

Graph two other exponential equations of the form y = a z to enhance your knowledge of this type of graph. State the equations you are graphing. y= z y y= z y E. Compare the graphs in section A with those in B, C, and D. Summarize what you notice. F. Compare what you have written with the description Euler writes concisely below. 30 Euler gives a magnificent and clear description of an exponential function in his precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite (1748). The values of the exponential a z depend primarily on the magnitude of the constant a . If a = 1 , then we always have a z = 1 , no matter what value is given z to z . If a > 1 , then a will have a greater value if the value of z is greater than it was originally and as z goes to infinity, so also a z increases to infinity. If z = 0 , then a z = 1 ; if z < 0 , then the values of a z become less than 1 and as z goes to z - , a goes to 0. On the other hand if a < 1 but still positive, then the values of a z decrease when z increases above 0. The exponential [ a z ] increases as z 1 increases in the negative direction. Since when a < 1 , we have < 1 , and if we a 1 -z z let = b , then a = b . For this reason we can examine the case when a < 1 a from the case when a > 1 . 31 Properties of Exponents Teacher Notes This activity gives students the opportunity to look at how a master mathematician expressed several ideas about exponents in his great precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite, published in 1748.

Chuquet's secret is the same as our answer to 8e. 33 Properties of Exponents Student Pages What would happen if exponents were numbers other than natural numbers? Islamic mathematicians of the 11th century were the earliest people to use negative numbers as exponents. Nicole Oresme, a French mathematician associated with the University of Paris around 1350, had some ideas about fractional exponents and even tried to explain what it would mean to have an irrational number as an exponent. In 1655, John Wallis, an English mathematician, gave a clearer explanation of fractional exponents and a few years later, Isaac Newton was able to make use of them with ease. Here, however, we look at the explanation of exponents of various types by the prolific mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748: Let the exponential to be considered be a where a is a constant and the exponent z is a variable. Since the exponent z stands for all determined numbers, it is clear at least that all positive integers can be substituted for z to give determined 1 2 3 4 5 6 values for a , a , a , a , a , a , etc. If for z we substitute the negative integers -1, -2, -3, etc. we obtain z 1 1 1 1 1 1 , , , , , , etc. If z = 0, a1 a2 a 3 a4 a5 a6 then we have a0 = 1. If we substitute a fraction for z , for instance 1 1 2 1 3 , , , , , etc., we obtain 2 3 3 4 4 the values more values, since the extraction of roots gives several values. However, we will consider only their primary [now called principal] values, since 1 2 1 3 a, a 3 , a 3 , a 4 , a 4 , etc. These symbols can have two or a a and 3 a ... In like manner we let z take irrational values, even though it is more 7 difficult to understand this concept. ... Thus a has a value which lies between 2 3 a and a ... from Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite by Leonhard Euler Some statements in that selection probably look more familiar than other statements. For example, in the first sentence Euler talks about negative exponents. In the second sentence he 1 tells about square roots so that we understand a 2 z 5 2 lies between is to be thought of as a ... function. For this reason. a 2 = a 1 and by implication, a 3 = 3 a , etc. We can use this to help us rewrite expressions with rational exponents as expressions with radicals instead. Complete the following using Euler's idea to rewrite the expressions using radicals. 34 2 1 1 2 3 = a 3 = a 2 3 = _________________ 1. a ( ) 1 2. a 4 = _________________ 3 3. a 4 =__________________= __________________=__________________ The sixth and seventh sentences refer to situations such as the fact that a given positive number has two different square roots, a positive one and a negative one. But since we want to define an exponential function, we will consider only the positive value. 5 lies between the two 2 7 successive integers 2 and 3. Finally, Euler also suggest that one can estimate the value of a when one knows that 7 lies between the two successive integers 2 and 3. Use this method to estimate the following by stating the numbers between which the given number lies. Example. 4 5 2 3 2 = _______________________________________________________________ 4. 4 2 3 = a number between 4 and 4 , that is, between 16 and 64. 5 2 , since The next sentence suggests a method to estimate the value of a 5. 2 6. 32 5 = ______________________________________________________________ 4 5 = ______________________________________________________________ 3 7. 9 2 = ________________________________________________________________ Clearly this last observation by Euler does not give very precise estimates, but it is insightful! 8. Familiar, Yet Different, Yet Related. You are a mathematics historian; you even consider yourself a detective of sorts! As you read the selection below, think about these questions: What familiar concept is being discussed? The notation looks familiar, but wait, does it have the same meaning? Or is it a little different? 35 Nicolas Chuquet, a mathematician who taught in Lyons, France, wrote these words sometime during the fifteenth century. He invented the notation, but its meaning has evolved somewhat since then. To understand the reason why denomination of number is added to denomination, ..., it is necessary to set down several proportional numbers beginning with 1 and arranged in a continuous sequence, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. or 3, 9, 27, etc. Numbers 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 Denomination 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Now it is necessary to know that 1 represents and is in the place of numbers, whose denomination is 0, 2 represents [...] the first terms, whose denomination is 1. 4 holds the place of the second terms, whose denomination is 2. And 8 is in the place of the third terms, 16 holds the place of the fourth terms, 32 represents the fifth terms, and so for the others. Now whoever multiplies 1 by 1, it comes to 1, and because 1 multiplied by 1 does not change at all, neither does any other number when it is multiplied by 1 increase or diminish, and for this consideration, whoever multiplies a number by a number, it comes to a number, whose denomination is 0. And whoever adds 0 to 0 makes 0. Afterwards, whoever multiplies 2, which is the first number by 1, which is a number, the multiplication comes to 2; then afterwards, whoever adds their denominations, which are 0 and 1, it makes 1; thus the multiplication comes to 21. And from this it comes that when one multiplies numbers by first terms or vice versa, it comes to first terms. Also whoever multiplies 21 by 21, it comes to 4 which is a second number. Thus the multiplication amounts to 42. For 2 multiplied by 2 makes 4 when adding the 36 denominations, that is 1 with 1, makes 2. And from this it comes that whoever multiplies first terms by first terms, it comes to second terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 21 by 42, it comes to 83. For 2 multiplied by 4 and 1 added with 2 makes 83. And thus whoever multiplies first terms by second terms, it comes to third terms. Also, whoever multiplies 42 by 42, it comes to 16 which is a fourth number, and for this reason whoever multiplies second terms by second terms, it comes to fourth terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 4 which is a second number by 8 which is a third number makes 32 which is a fifth number. And thus whoever multiplies second terms by third terms or vice versa, it comes to fifth terms. And third terms by fourth terms comes to 7th terms, and fourth terms by fourth terms, it comes to 8th terms, and so for the others. In this discussion there is manifest a secret which is in the proportional numbers. It is that whoever multiplies a proportional number by itself, it comes to the number of the double of its denomination, as, whoever multiplies 8 which is a third number by itself, it comes to 64 which is a sixth. And 16 which is a fourth number multiplied by itself should come to 256, which is an eighth. And whoever multiplies 128 which is the 7th proportional by 512 which is the 9th, it should come to 65536 which is the 16th. from N. Chuquet, pp. 144, 151-153 a.

Compound interest holds much promise for applying mathematical ideas to relatively important everyday applications, such as the amount of money an investor makes on a particular investment, a notion Americans are familiar with living in a capitalist society. The need to understand compound interest also arises in calculating the interest that accrues on credit card purchases, car, home, and boat loans, and financial investments. In the following activity, a historical example is used as a springboard to discuss compound interest. The historical context is centered on the European colonist's purchase of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Exposure to the compound interest formula is a prerequisite.) Objective: To investigate an application of exponential growth, compound interest, using an situation taken from the historical context of the Dutch "purchase" of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Materials: Student Page; Calculator; Graphing calculator and Internet access (optional) Time Frame: Two 45-minute class periods; extended project would be done outside of class How to Use: To begin the discussion of exponential growth and compound interest embedded in a historical context, provide students with the historical opener on an overhead transparency (see Transparency #1). Have students read and reflect on this historical situation. You might ask students to develop their own questions that arise from the historical situation presented. Be prepared to consider social and historical questions as well as mathematical related questions. A second option would be to use the guiding questions in the student activity to develop the lesson. One way to begin the lesson is to look at question 1 involving compound interest. First, it might be helpful to review the general compound interest formula. You might also show students the derivation for the general compound interest formula. It might be helpful to derive the compound interest formula using an example first. Then show the students the formal algebraic derivation for the compound interest formula. Consider the following example involving compound interest. You have $100. You want to invest your money in a fund that guarantees 8% interest compounded quarterly over six years. You have the following given information: r = 8% = 0.08 annual interest rate t=6 time in years 38 n=4 number of compounding periods per year nt = 24 number of compounding periods P = $100 principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods Because we are looking for the total amount of money at the end of 24 periods, we want to find S 24 . Guide the students through the derivation using the above given information. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is 0.08 S1 = 100 + 100 = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is 0.08 2 S 2 = S1 + S1 = S1 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02)(1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the third compounding period is 0.08 2 3 S3 = S 2 + S2 = S 2 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 Explain to your students that we are looking for S 24 ; that is, the total amount of money we have accumulated at the end of the 24th period. Next guide students to the algebraic derivation of the general compound interest. We have the following given information: r = annual interest rate t = time in years n = number of compounding periods per year nt = total number of compounding periods P = principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods r = interest rate per compounding period n nt = total number of compounding periods. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is r r S 1 = P + P = P 1 + n n 39 The total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is r r r r r r r S 2 = S1 + S1 = P1 + + P1 + = P1 + 1 + = P1 + . n n n n n n n The total amount of money we have at the end of the nt -th compounding period is S nt = P1 + r . n nt 2 Using the derivation of the general compound interest formula, lead students to the exponential equation that describes the situation described in the historical opener. Let P = 24, r = 7%, n = 1 (compounded annually) and t = 372 (the number of years since 1626 this is being calculated for the year 1998) r y = S nt = P1 + n 0.07 y = 241 + 1 nt (1)( 372 ) y = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410 Guide your students to discover that the initial formula for y represents an exponential growth function of the form, f ( x) = ab x where a is the initial amount of money, b is the growth factor, and x is the total number of compounding periods. Stress that because b > 1 in compound interest problems, then the function is an example of exponential growth. Guide students to change a and b in f(x) = abx to see the effect on the curve. Encourage students to examine the function for a > 0, a < 0, b >1, and 0 < b < 1 and to write a complete explanation of the results they found. Have students solve additional examples of exponential growth problems either using variations on the historical opener problem or problems from a textbook. Give students an opportunity to create their own problems and to explain them to the class. 40 Compound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase Solutions 1. As indicated above, y = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410 2. The 3.8 billion dollars is less than the amount found in number 1, so perhaps, Minuit paid too much, or the interest rate is too high, or the tax assessment value is too low. 3. Minuit should have paid a great deal more. Land in the Old World was dear and certainly, an equivalent amount of land, in say Holland or England, would have been very expensive. But given that the amount found in number 1 is higher than the tax valuation in number 2, find a payment that would give the tax valuation. This time solve for the initial amount given that the final amount is 3.8 billion dollars and the interest rate is 7% with 372 years (this solution is being done in 1998) with annual compounding yields: 3.8 10 = a(1.07) 9 372 3.8 10 9 a= .044567 or about 4.5cents.

After the final negotiations were agreed upon, Minuit purchased the island of Manhattan (New York City) by giving them trinkets valued at approximately 60 guilders (currency of the Netherlands), or $24. 1. Suppose that the Native Americans invested the money they received from the purchase of the land at 7% compounded annually. How much money would they have today? 2. Now consider that the current tax assessment value of Manhattan is 3.8 billion dollars. Discuss the implications of the land deal based on this information. 3. Based on question two, what might have been a fair price for Minuit to pay? 4. Find the actual interest rate at the time of the purchase in 1626.

This famous mathematics book was written by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in the middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that this problem appears in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum shows that issues of population growth were of concern to the people living in the eighteenth century. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. However, this activity is designed to solve the problem using exponential functions first. Later, when logarithms and logarithmic functions are developed in the module, you can show students how to solve this problem using logarithms. Showing students how to solve this problem using both exponential and logarithmic functions provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the inherent connection between exponential and logarithmic functions. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objectives: To develop students' understanding of exponential growth functions by using a problem of population growth taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum, which was written in the middle eighteenth century. To show students that mathematics was and is done in specific historical and social contexts.

The above population growth problem was taken from Introductio in analysin infinitorum (Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite) (1748), a famous mathematics book written by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783. The fact that this problem appears in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum shows that issues of population growth were of concern to the people living in the eighteenth century.

Extended Project: Discover where Euler was living in 1748. Determine the population of that area during the time he lived there. After you determine the population in 1748, determine today's population of that area based on the above exponential model. Compare with the actual number of people living there now. How close was your approximation? 52 If the population in a certain region increases annually by one-thirtieth and at one time there were 100,000 inhabitants, we would like to know the population after 100 years.

It helps explain why a mathematical model may need to change with the passing decades. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry (Prerequisites: Using various regression equations on a graphing utility to describe data) Objective: To study various regression equations culminating in the need for the logistic equation to model real-world data Materials: Overhead projector; transparency made from the Population Data; Graphing calculators with regression equation capabilities, including the logistic function Time Frame: One class period How to Use: This activity works very well as a teacher-guided discussion with the everexpanding data set being modeled by successive functions. It helps the students see that as more and more data is available a model may need to change in order to make better predictions. 1. Perhaps begin by asking students which statistics about New York City might be valuable and why. Lead them to realize that population trends might prove useful in city planning in such areas as number and size of schools, sewage treatment and garbage collection, road construction and maintenance. 2. Using the historical information in the lesson discuss past efforts in history to solve similar prediction problems. 3. Ask students to look at the initial data set and imagine that they are city planners for NYC after the 1820 census and that they need to predict the population for the next few decades. Have them enter the data into lists on their calculators or computers, make a scatterplot of the data and fit an appropriate regression function to the data. Then have them predict the population for the next decade. 4. Ask students to pretend that a couple decades have passed and ask if their prediction was good for 1840. Now have them add this data to their previous lists, make another scatterplot incorporating all the data from 1790 through 1880, choose an appropriate regression function and predict the population for the next decade. Some students may try a quadratic regression function. It actually appears to fit the data better than the exponential function. You may want to tell them that fitting the data is not the only criterion for choosing a particular regression equation. For example, the quadratic function would imply that at first the population of NYC would decrease during the first decade under consideration. While that is 54 possible, it doesn't fit the real data that is ever increasing. They may point out that the exponential function overestimates the population in the final decade of this data set. That will point the way to needing a different regression function, a suspicion that is confirmed by the next data set. 5. For the third data set, after plotting additional points, students may suggest that it is composed of several parts, such as exponential for the first third, quadratic for the second third, and logarithmic for the final third. You can then suggest that this S-shape is characteristic of the logistic function and students may use their TI-83 graphing calculators to fit a regression function to the data. 6. For the final data set, after plotting the additional points, students may decide it is best described as a cubic function, but you may want to point out that a cubic equation would have predicted a negative population for the first three decades of the 1800's. 7. A discussion of possible reasons why the population growth rate slows down in the final set is a lively finale to this activity. Students may bring up such possibilities as population density, insufficient water/sewage treatment plants, insufficient medical services for a greater population, not enough roads or public transportation, not enough schools to support a greater population.

We will also consider the entire concept of using mathematics to model a real-world situation. An important use of mathematics is its ability to take current numerical information, or data, and then make predictions of future behavior based on that data. A useful field of investigation is that of population growth, with its obvious impact on city planning, environmental concerns, allocation of resources, and many other areas. Data from previous years can indicate important trends; social scientists, economists, and many other professionals have discovered that one can also use data to predict future growth patterns. We will use data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census on the population of New York City to investigate three different predictive models. One simple possibility for population growth is that the growth is constant; in other words, that the population grows by the same amount each year. The population can then be depicted mathematically with an "arithmetic" sequence, a sequence of numbers where any two successive terms differ by the same amount. An example of an arithmetic sequence is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17... A more complicated model uses the premise that the growth is proportional to the present population; in other words, the larger the population, the more people are added each year. In this situation, we often say that the growth rate, say r%, is constant. The population in this case can be represented by a "geometric" sequence, one where any two successive terms have the same ratio. An example of a geometric sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... A third model uses the idea that the growth of the population will be proportional to two factors: the current population and also how close the population gets to some ceiling or maximal size. This model implies that initial growth may be faster, but as the constraints of resources come into play, then the growth will slow down. The full mathematical development of these three models requires techniques of calculus, and therefore we will not dwell unnecessarily on the methods used to obtain the equations. However, we can briefly summarize the central mathematical conclusions. In the first model the population y will be a linear function of time t, that is, the population y will be given by the familiar formula y = mt + b. The second model results in an exponential model of growth, in which the population y is expressed by y = y 0 e rt where y 0 is some given initial value, r is the rate, t is the time and e is the familiar 2.718... The third model results in the logistic model of c , where for the additional variables, c represents the maximal population growth, y = 1 + ae ( - bt ) which can be sustained (called the "carrying capacity") and a and b are constants which emerge from a particular set of data. 56 Let's consider the use of these three models with the same overall set of data, restricted to different time periods. The U. S. Bureau of the Census contains a myriad of information about populations of various segments of the United States from 1790 until the present. (The Constitution of the United States orders that a count of the population be held every 10 years in order to correctly apportion the seats in the House of Representatives; this raw data can then be used in variety of ways to gain interesting information about patterns of growth in the U. S.) One such set of information is the population of New York City as measured every 10 years in the Census. For the period of 1790 to 1820, the Census gives the following counts: Year Population 1790 33,131 1800 60,515 1810 96,373 1820 123,706 Using your graphing calculator, plot those four points using the Year as the x-coordinate and the Population as the y-coordinate and a suitable viewing rectangle; you should obtain something which resembles Chart 1. It should be pretty clear that these four data points look like they almost fall on a line; you can use the capabilities of your particular calculator to discover the regression equation line which will fit the data which gives you an answer of y = 3075.83x 5,473,441.9. Graph that equation over the set of data to observe how good a fit it is. However, you test a model by not only how well it fits given data but also how well it will predict the future. The count for 1830 was 202,589, and the count for 1840 was 312,710. According to the equation above you should expect the count for 1830 to be 155,327 and the count for 1840 to be 186,085; clearly, the mathematical model is at odds with the real data. The linear model does not account for the complexity of the information and significantly undercounts the real population. Let's consider more of the set of data next; to the data given above for 1790 to 1820, expand the data set to include the following through 1880: Year Pop. 1830 202,589 1840 312,710 1850 515,547 1860 813,669 1870 942,292 1880 1,206,299 Graphing these in a suitable viewing rectangle should yield something resembling Chart 2. This graph should look like the graph of an exponential function, examples of which you have already seen. You can again use the capabilities of your calculator to obtain an exponential function that fits the data, yielding y = (11162 10 -27 )e .040578 x . Graph that function over the data set, and . again note the fit. Using our previous approach, the census count for 1890 was 1,515,301 and the count for 1900 was 3,437,202; our equation predicts that the figure for 1890 should be 2,265,258 and for 1900 it should be 3,398.969. The exponential equation fits the given data well, but again it is less useful when we try to expand it to cover a broader scope. Now we will consider more data; we expand the data set to include the population through 1950: 57 1890 1,515,301 1900 3,437,202 1910 4,766,883 1920 5,620,048 1930 6,930,446 1940 7,454,995 1950 7,891,957 Graph the population from 1790 through 1950, and note how the graph initially increases very rapidly, but then levels off and increases much more slowly. Compare your graph to Chart 3. This `S' shape is highly suggestive of the model of logistic growth. If your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y = . Again, map this function 1 + (12224 10 50 )e ( -.060438 x ) . over the data set, and observe the fit. To get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it. Notice how the curve flattens out. What is the implication of such a graph? Now, let's consider the full range of data through the 1990 census. Include in your data the following: Year Population 1960 7,781,984 1970 7,894,862 1980 7,071,639 1990 7,322,564 The graph of the full set of data is in Chart 4; make sure your graph is similar. Note the strong fit of the curve through the data of 1950, and then how the curve fails to model the data, particularly in 1980 and 1990. Some conclusions: The first matter for us to consider here is the history of some of these models. The simplest concept of growth is one that results in an arithmetic pattern; early scientific consideration of population growth of crops and domesticated animals demonstrated this model was not sufficient to explain the observed growth. Thomas Malthus (1766 1834) was an English clergyman and political economist who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. In there, he wrote that "population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio." When this idea was investigated mathematically, it resulted in the exponential model expressed above. Pierre Francois Verhulst (1804 1849) was a Belgian mathematician and statistician who is credited with first writing about the logistic model of growth in 1845, when he attempted to take into account factors, such as limited resources, that would also tend to slow down growth after time. (Our logistic equation is written in the form y = f(t); Verhulst wrote it in the form t = h(y). This form requires the use of logarithms, and apparently he coined the word `logistic' to suggest the connection between the curve and the characteristic shape of a logarithm.) Next, we need to consider the whole concept of a model in and of itself. First, one point is to recognize that while a mathematical model may fit a particular set of data, it is a somewhat dangerous perspective to feel that the model will always work. We considered three models linear, exponential, and then logistic which did a reasonable job with one set of data, but then became less accurate as the data encompassed a larger time frame. There is a danger in assuming that we can ever exactly describe a living situation with a mathematical model. There are 58 techniques of chaos theory that we could call on to account for the fluctuations in the data we considered in the periods of time following 1950, but what is to say that the future data will fit this model as well? It may be that all we can ever hope for is a rough description of a living entity without ever attaining any sort of permanent exactness. Second, mathematics expands to generate more sophisticated techniques as more data is made available. Malthus had a reasonable perspective, given his time; Verhulst developed a better one, but not necessarily because he was somehow smarter he had access to more information. Complicated models require equally complicated mathematics even to obtain approximate correlation with real-world data. We can even incorporate the new field of chaos theory to further refine our model. Third, we need to be careful about assuming that just because we can describe a set of data mathematically, we have somehow discovered what is creating the data. The Americans Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed independently rediscovered Verhulst's analysis of population growth in 1920. They cautioned: "No process of empirically graduating raw data with a curve can in and of itself demonstrate the fundamental law which causes the occurring change." In other words, do not mistake an ability to describe a set of data with a mathematical formula with understanding what is creating the data itself. It may be that the mathematics helps us to see some underlying principles, but the ability to extrapolate the future from a set of data is at best an inexact procedure. However, in the article which they wrote to discuss the mathematics of logistic growth and its application to population modeling, Reed and Pearl concluded: "...the hypothesis here advanced as to the law of population growth [that of logistic growth]...so closely describes the known facts regarding the past history of that growth, as to make it potentially profitable to continue the mathematical development and refinement of the hypothesis further." It may still be very useful for us to study the particular model, realizing that we still do not have a full mathematical description of the phenomena being studied. In an article appearing in the March, 1998 edition of the journal Primus on the logistic curve, Bonnie Shulman warns that while the difference between the mathematics of a model and the underlying dynamics may be clear to mathematicians, "important policy decisions are made based on the predictions arising from models." It is perfectly understandable that we would use mathematical models to try to predict the future, but those predictions must always be taken with a sense of caution. Biologists have studied population growth of various species extensively, and as such have repeatedly come across examples of logistic growth. Even at that, in Population Biology of Plants, John L. Harper states: "The logistic curve remains central to population biology, not because it describes how populations behave but rather because it provides a standard base of ideal behavior against which the reality can be judged and measured."

An experiment using the CBL to collect data and then mathematics to analyze it could be incorporated here as well; many books, such as the Texas Instruments book by Chris Brueningsen relating mathematics and science using the CBL collection device, are available. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exponential and logarithmic functions; Solving exponential and logarithmic equations; Best fit curves (optional) Objective: The goal of this activity is to give students an opportunity to learn the history behind Newton's Law of Cooling and then to use this law in several exercises. Materials: Graphing calculator; Internet access (optional) Time Frame: This activity can be completed in one class period with the exercises started in the class, the rest to be assigned as homework. The amount of time needed for this activity may be decreased or increased depending on the mathematical level of your students. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss the history of Newton's Law of Cooling with the class after the students have had time to read the information. It might be necessary to do several examples of solving exponential and logarithmic equations before assigning this activity. If additional activities are desired, the teacher should visit the cited websites (or others that may be available) to determine the appropriateness for his/her class. Additionally, if the teacher decides to run an experiment using CBL equipment, there would need to be additional preparation on the part of the teacher. Bibliography: 1. Edwards, G. H. and David E.

Substituting T0 = 340, T(1) = 100, and Tm = 70 into Newton's Law of Cooling gives: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 100 = 70 + (340 - 70)e k (1) 30 = 270e k 30 = ek 270 1 1 = e k ln = k . 9 9 1 k can be left in this form, or it can be evaluated : k = ln -2.1972 9 kt ln(1/9)t ln(1/9) t t b. First notice that e = e = (e ) = (1/9) . Now substitute the values into Newton's Law of Cooling T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 1 80 = 70 + (340 - 70) 9 1 10 = 270 9 10 1 = 270 9 t t t 3 1 1 1 1 = = 3 = 2t t = hours. 2 27 9 3 3 2. This time the Tm is the unknown. T0 = 200, T(10) = 150 and k = -0.05. Substituting into Newton's Law of Cooling yields: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5(10) 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5 Multiply both sides by e0.5 . 150e0.5 = Tm e0.5 + 200 - Tm t 3 2t 63 150e0.5 + 200 = Tm (e0.5 - 1) 150e0.5 + 200 Tm = 72.92 e0.5 - 1 3. a. Using the points (0,0) and (34,100), the slope, m, of the line is m= 100 - 0 50 = . 34 - 0 17 The equation of the line relating the linseed oil temperatures to the centigrade temperatures is 50 C = N 17 b. If we substitute into the previous formula, we get C = 50 (1 2 ) 3 5 .2 9 17 This value is lower than the 37 C that we use. c. Again, substituting the given value for N gives us 50 C= (71) 208.82 17 Newton's value is lower than the actual value. d. There are several possible explanations. One is that Newton's values were approximations; another is that the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures is not linear. A suggested additional activity would be to use the three points (0,0), (12, 37) and (34, 100) in a different model a best fit line or a quadratic equation, for example. And then see how the new model works with the melting point of tin. 64 Newton's Law of Cooling Student Pages History Besides discovering calculus, Newton experimented in chemistry and alchemy. One of the Newton results discovered is what is now called Newton's Law of Cooling. He wrote anonymously "A Scale of the Degrees of Heat" in the 1701 volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Due to Newton's fame, Roger Cotes easily deduced that Newton was the author of the anonymous paper. Using a linseed oil thermometer, because linseed oil has a high boiling point of 240 C, Newton studied the melting points of various metals and alloys. Newton devised a method for measuring temperatures of up to 1000 C. his law of cooling. Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate at which the temperature T(t) changes in a cooling body is proportional to the difference between the temperature in the body and constant temperature Tm of the surrounding medium. If one writes this statement as a differential equation and solves, one gets Newton's Law of Cooling in the form T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)ekt where T0 is the initial temperature of the heated body at time t = 0 and where k is a constant which depends on the item being cooled. Notice that this equation is an example of exponential decay decay since k turns out to be negative because the body's temperature is decreasing. 65 Exercises: 1. When a cake is removed from the oven, it is 340. One hour later, it has cooled to 100. If the temperature of the room is 70, a. find the constant k in Newton's Law of Cooling; b. find how long will it take for the cake to cool to 80? 2. Suppose the constant k Newton's Law of Cooling -0.05. If the temperature of a cup of coffee is 200 when it is poured and 150 10 minutes later, how warm is the room? 3. According to Newton's paper, "A Scale of the Degrees of Heat", he chose the following temperatures using his linseed oil thermometer: the freezing temperature of water was 0 and the boiling point of water was 34. The Celsius temperature for the freezing of water is 0 and the boiling point of water is 100. a. Find the linear equation that represents the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures. Let the linseed oil temperatures be the independent variable. b. Newton said that body temperature using his linseed oil thermometer was 12. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for body temperature. How does this compare with the 37 C that we use? c. Newton found that the melting point of tin was 71. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for the melting point of tin. According to the Smithsonian Physical Tables, the melting point of tin is 232 C. How does this compare with Newton's value? d. From the two examples you just did, how would you explain the discrepancies between the linseed oil thermometer values that Newton obtained, and the Celsius values that we use? 66 Euler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Teacher Notes Introduction: This activity highlights a mathematical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum of 1748. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objective: To develop students' understanding of exponential functions by using a problem taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator; Graphing calculator (optional) Time Frame: One 45-minute class period How to Use: Consider using cooperative groups to do this activity. At the very least, consider pairing up students to work on this activity. If students have not had much work with exponential functions, you might need to help them find the Have students consider the following historical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's highly influential pre-calculus book, Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, written in 1748: If the progression 2, 4, 16, 256, ... is formed by letting each term be the square of the preceding term, find the value of the twenty-fifth term. This example comes from Chapter VI: On Exponentials and Logarithms of Euler's book.. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. We simply want to graph the curve that models this progression. It is preferable to have students graph this curve using a graphing calculator. If there is no access to graphing calculators, have students make a table of values and graph the exponential function on graph paper. A suggested window for graphing is x: (0, 10) and y: (0, 300). Students must first determine the function that models this progression. The students should arrive at y = f ( x) = 2 2 . x 67 A sample table the students may make is as follows: x 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7At this time, students should find the twenty-fifth term is ) f (25 = 22 = 216,777,216. Students will quickly discover this expression cannot be evaluated on a calculator. It is important to stress that Euler solved the problem using logarithms--a topic that will be discussed later and connected with exponential functions. This example is a prelude to logarithmic functions--the inverse of exponential functions. Once the students have discovered the function and curve that modeled Euler's original problem, you can discuss the relationship between this function and the standard exponential function 24 y = f ( x) = 2 x. Then have the students make a comparison between the two functions. Note: Euler's original solution with logarithms to this example is provided (See Logarithmic Functions: Euler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Revisited). Later in the unit when you introduce logarithms, it would be appropriate to revisit this problem and show students its connection to logarithms and Euler's logarithmic solution. This will make students aware of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard, translated. by John D. Blanton.

Transparency 72 Calculating ex Teacher Notes Introduction: We present a slight modification of Euler's method for calculating e x as a power series, a generalized polynomial. Level: Precalculus. A prerequisite is the Binomial Theorem and the calculation of e as in the section "What Will Happen If..." Objective: To show how to calculate the power series for ex Time Frame: One or two class periods, with a homework assignment at the end. How to Use: This is a teacher-directed lesson. The Student Pages should be given to the students, but the teacher will need to present this material and answer questions about it. 73 Calculating ex Student Pages We present here a method of calculating ex by means of a power series, a polynomial of "infinite degree." We first recall the Binomial Theorem: (a + b) n = a n + na n -1b + n(n - 1) n- 2 2 n(n - 1)n - 2) n -3 3 a b + a b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn . You should make up several examples of this for practice. In particular, note that the formula is somewhat simpler when a = 1. We then have (1 + b) n = 1 + nb + n(n - 1) 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2) 3 b + b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn . Next, recall the result, discussed in an earlier section of this module, that e can be found by considering the expression 1 1 + n n and letting n get larger and larger. Today, we generally write this as 1 e = lim 1 + . n n This means simply that as we let n get larger and larger, the given expression gets closer and closer to a particular number, which we have called e. Euler, however, writing before the notion of limit had been explained, would simply write 1 e = 1 + , n where n is an infinitely large number. Today, we do not generally use such concepts, and probably Euler himself knew that such numbers did not really exist. But what he meant by the phrase "infinitely large number" was simply a very very very large number; he used his intuition then to determine what properties such very very very large numbers would have. We will see some of these properties as we work through his argument. n n 74 1 Since e = 1 + , where n is infinitely large, we can also calculate e r . First, we note n that if n is infinitely large and r is a finite quantity, then n/r is also infinitely large. We can therefore rewrite e as 1 e = 1 + n/r It follows that n/r 1 . e = 1 + n / r r r n/r n . By one of the basic rules for exponents, we can rewrite this in the form 1 e = 1 + . n/r r n But we know that 1 r = .. We therefore have, finally, n/r n r er = 1 + , n n again where n is infinitely large. r . Of n course, we know that the binomial theorem is only valid for finite values of n, but we will assume that it is also true when n is infinitely large. After all, we are thinking of such values n simply as very very very large positive integers. However, since we do not know how large n actually is, we will only calculate the first few terms of the binomial expansion and use dots to indicate that this expression simply goes on for a long long time. Technically, this "infinite polynomial" is called a power series. We now apply the binomial theorem to this last expression, taking a = 1 and b = We get 75 r e = 1 + n r n r n(n - 1) r n(n - 1)(n - 2) r n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) r = 1+ n + + + + 1 2 n 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 n n n = 1+ r + n(n - 1)r 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2)r 3 n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)r 4 + + + 1 2n 2 1 2 3n3 1 2 3 4n 4 2 3 4 We want to simplify the various terms of this expression. So we have to use a property of ``infinitely large numbers.'' In particular, we note that if n is infinitely large, subtracting 1 n -1 from n will have no appreciable result. Thus = 1 . Similarly, if we subtract 2 or 3 or indeed n any finite number from n, this will not really change that infinitely large number. We therefore n-k = 1 for any finite number k. What this means, then, is that in the expression above, have n the quantities n, n 1, n 2, n 3, ... in the numerators always "cancel" the factors of n in the denominators. It follows that our expression reduces to er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ( k - 1) k is usually called You may know that if k is any integer, the expression 1 2 3 r k factorial and is written k! Thus, our expression for e , usually called its power series expansion, is written as er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 2! 3! 4! The value of the power series expansion for Euler was that it enabled him to calculate values for e r . In particular, he could calculate the value for e1 = e . We can do it as well, by substituting r = 1 into the series. We get e = 1+1+ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + + + + 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = 1+1+ + + + + + + + 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.166666667 + 0.041666667 + 0.008333333 + 0.001388889 + 0.000198413 + 0.000024802 + 2.718278771 2.71828 76 Your calculator can, of course, calculate e as well as e r , for any r in a fraction of a second. You may wonder how it does it. Although different calculators use different procedures for doing this, one of the ways your calculator may work is, in fact, by using the series for e r ,. Your calculator is basically hard-wired to perform additions and multiplications; since calculating with a power series just involves these operations, all that has to happen is that the calculator must perform very many of these operations very quickly. And that is precisely what it can do. Although a normal graphing calculator can probably only calculate e to 10 decimal places, it has been calculated to far more places by a computer. The first 100 decimal places are as follows: e 2.71828 18284 59045 23535 02874 71352 66249 77572 47093 69995 95749 66967 62772 40766 30353 54759 45713 82178 52516 64274 Like another important number , the number e is irrational and even transcendental. The first statement was proved by Euler in 1737. That e is transcendental, that is, that it cannot be a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, was proved in 1873 by Charles Hermite. Interestingly, these two important numbers are closely related, as we will see in the next activity. Exercises: 1. Use your calculator to determine the decimal form of the next three terms in the series for e, namely, 1/9, 1/10, and 1/11. Add these values to the value already calculated and check that you now have e calculated correctly to 8 decimal places. 2. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1. Namely, replace r by 0.1 in that series and evaluate using your calculator. Check that using the terms through the fifth power term gives you accuracy to 8 decimal places. 3. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. 4. Use the power series for e r to calculate e1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. How many terms do you need to use to get e1 to 8-place accuracy? 77 Equations using e Teacher Notes Introduction: Students are intrigued by e and want to know more about where it is used. Here are two equations that help to satisfy their curiosity. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry (Prerequisites: discussion of e) Objective: to introduce students to two equations using e Materials: Student Pages for each student Time Frame: 20 minutes How to Use: The teacher may want to use this short activity to amplify students' work involving the transcendental number e Bibliography: Kasner, Edward and Newman, James, Mathematics and the Imagination.

Many students will answer parabola. 2. e is the basis of natural logarithms and is used in many real-life applications, such as population growth or radioactive decay. i is the -1 which is used for complex numbers and in many real-life applications, such as electricity. is used, for example, in the area formula for a circle and volume formulas for cylinders, cones and circles. 1 is the identity element for multiplication, just to name one reason it is special. 0 is a place holder, just to name one reason it is special. 79 Equations using e Student Pages 1. Hanging link chains and two brothers Imagine a chain made of identical links, hanging from the two endpoints. You've probably seen such a curve as a barrier around a grassy plot or the wire suspended from telephone poles along a highway. Sketch below the shape of the curve formed by the chain. What shape does the curve look like? ________________________________ You are not alone in thinking about this. Over three hundred years ago two brothers of the famous Bernoulli family of mathematicians tried to figure out the equation that described it. In May, 1691, Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem in a scientific journal, Acta Eruditorum. A year later his younger brother Johann as well as two other famous mathematicians, Christian Huygens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, correctly solved this problem. In fact Jakob Bernoulli was not able to solve it; he and his brother Johann had a strong rivalry as shown in this letter from Johann to a friend. "You say that my brother proposed this problem; that is true, but does it follow that he had a solution of it then? Not at all. When he proposed this problem at my suggestion (for I was the first to think of it), neither the one nor the other of us was able to solve it; we despaired of it as insoluble, until Mr. Leibniz gave notice to the public in the Leipzig journal of 1690, p. 360, that he had solved the problem but did not publish his solution, so as to give time to other analysts, and it was this that encouraged us, my brother and me, to apply ourselves afresh. The efforts of my brother were without success; for my part, I was more fortunate, for I found the skill (I say it without boasting, why should I conceal the truth?) to solve it in full.... The next morning, filled with Joy, I ran to my brother, who was still struggling miserably with this Gordian knot without getting anywhere, always thinking like Galileo that the catenary was a parabola. Stop! Stop! I say to him, don't torture yourself anymore to try to prove the identity of the catenary with the parabola, since it is entirely false." quoted from e the Story of a Number, p. 141 Actually this curve is called a catenary from the Latin word catena meaning chain. The equation e ax + e - ax that describes the catenary is y = where a is a constant that is determined by the 2a density of the chain and the tension as it is held. Calculus is required to prove that this is correct. 80 2. The Most Beautiful Equation e i + 1 = 0 Many consider this to be one of the most beautiful equations ever discovered since it incorporates five of the special numbers of mathematics. It was discovered by Leonhard Euler, a mathematician who studied and contributed to many different branches of mathematics. Why is each of the five numbers special in mathematics? e _______________________________________________________________ i _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________ 1________________________________________________________________ 0________________________________________________________________ To Benjamin Pierce, one of Harvard's leading mathematicians in the nineteenth century, this formula of Euler came as something of a revelation. Having discovered it one day, he turned to his students and said: "Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means.

In these paragraphs, Euler introduces all the information about logarithms that we usually cover in our modern day courses - in two pages!

In the student Activity that follows, the students will read and then do examples demonstrating Euler's explanations on logarithms. It would be good after the students finish the activity to point out that there probably is enough information about logarithms here for mastering the basics of logarithmic functions.

Euler uses "log n" to mean "log base a of n." Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard. Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite Book1. Translated by John D. Blanton. Springer Verlag, 1988 82 Seeing John Napier, A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithms, 1616 83 Introduction to Logarithms Solutions Part 1 1. If az = y, then z = log y. 2. Yes 3. "a" is the base of the logarithm and it must be a number greater than 1. 4. The domain is positive real numbers, if the logarithm is to be real also. Part 2 5. If y = 1 in az = y, then az = 1 which implies that z = 0. But a0 = 1 corresponds to loga 1 = 0. 6. By definition, a1 = a loga a= 1, a2 = a2 loga a2 = 2, ..., an = an loga an = n 7. Since a is a positive number, 1/a, 1/a2, ... will also be positive. 1/a, 1/a2,...are less than one since the reciprocal of a positive number greater than one is a positive number less than one. (There are other explanations.) loga 1/a = loga a-1 and by the definition of logarithms, loga a-1 = y ay = a-1. Therefore, y = -1 = loga a-1. The same argument holds for the other logarithms. Part 3 8. Power rule: log yn = nz Product rule: log vy = x + y = log v + log y Quotient rule: log (y/v) = z x = log y log v 9. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. vy = axaz = ax+z so log vy = x + y. It follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. 10. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. v/y = ax /az = ax-z so log v/y = x - y. It follows that log v/y = x - y = log v - log y. Hence, the logarithm of the quotient of two numbers is equal to the difference of the logarithms of the factors. 84 11. If you know the logarithm of 2 and the logarithm of 3, you know the logarithms of 6 = (2)(3), 9 = 32, 27 = 33,... , 4 = 22, 8 = 23, ..., 1.5 = 3/2, 2/3, ... 36 = 2232,...and an infinite number of other examples using just these two values. See the Student Activity Calculation of Logarithms - Using the Method of Napier and Briggs for more examples. Part 4 12. The only way for the value of a logarithm to be rational is if the number is a power of the base. There are many examples: log4 8 = 3/2 (since 8 = 43/2, i.e. 8 is a power of the base 4). 13. A surd is the square root of a number that is not a perfect square such as 2 , 5 , 7 ,... 14 Part 5 15. The rule usually looks like this: log a n = 16. loga n = p ap = n logb n = q bq = n log10 n log10 a ap = bq a = bq/p Since b, p and q are all constant, a is also a constant and this value has nothing to do with n, the number whose logarithm we are evaluating. 17. Looking for log2 n = q, log10 n = p (we would know this value, since it is a base 10 logarithm) log102 = 0.3010300, also log2 2 = 1 Then p/q= 0.3010300 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277p. So, if every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2. Note that this is equivalent to the usual method you gave in number 15: log10 n log10 n = = (3.3219277) log10 n log 2 n = log10 2 .3010300 85 Introduction to Logarithms Student Pages Part 1 Read paragraph 102. Then answer the questions. 1. In this paragraph, Euler gives the definition of the LOGARITHM of y. What is it? 2. Is this the same definition that you have been given in your class? 3.

Explain why Euler says that, no matter the base, log 1 = 0. (We would write loga 1 = 0.) 86 6. Explain why "log a = 1, log a2 = 2, log a3 = 3, log a4 = 4, etc". 7. Explain why 1/a, 1/a2, ... are positive numbers less than 1 and why their logarithm is negative. Part 3. Read paragraph 104. Then answer the questions. 8. What does Euler say the product rule, the quotient rule and the power rule for logarithms are? 9. Give the explanation Euler uses for the product rule. 10. Give a similar explanation for the quotient rule. 87 11. How can these rules be used to "find the logarithms of many numbers from a knowledge of the logarithms of a few"? Part 4 Read paragraph 105. Then answer the questions. 12. What does the first sentence mean? Give an example of a logarithm of a number that is rational. 13. What is a surd? You may have to use a dictionary. 14. Why, according to Euler, is the logarithmic function a transcendental function? 88 Part 5 Read paragraph 107. Then answer the questions. 15. Give the change of basis rule that you have learned in your class. 16. Translate into your own words: "If". 17. Show that Euler is describing how to change base 10 logarithms to base 2 logarithms his example. in 89 Introduction to Logarithms From Introductio in analysin infinitorum Taken from Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) by Leonhard Euler Chapter VI. On Exponentials and Logarithms 102. Just as, given a number a, for any value of z, we can find the value of y [= az], so, in turn, given a positive value for y, we would like to give a value for z, such that az = y. This value of z, insofar as it is viewed as a function of y, it is called the LOGARITHM of y. The discussion about logarithms supposes that there is some fixed constant to be substituted for a, and this number is the base for the logarithm. Having assumed this base, we say the logarithm of y is the exponent in the power az such that az = y. It has been customary to designate the logarithm of y by the symbol log y. If az = y, then z = log y. From this we understand that the base of the logarithms, although it depends on our choice, still it should be a number greater than 1. Furthermore, it is only of positive numbers that we can represent the logarithm with a real number. 103. Whatever logarithmic base we choose we always have log1 = 0, since in the equation az = y, which corresponds to z = log y, when we let y = 1 we have z = 0. From this it follows that the logarithm of a number greater than 1 will be positive, depending on the base a. Thus log a = 1, log a2 = 2, log a3 = 3, log a4 = 4, etc. and, after the fact, we know what base has been chosen, that is the number whose logarithm is equal to 1 is the logarithmic base. The logarithm of a positive number less than 1 will be negative. Notice that log 1/a = -1, log 1/a2 = -2, log 1/a3 = -3, etc., but the logarithms of negative numbers will not be real, but complex, as we have already noted. 104. In like manner if log y = z, then log y2 = 2z, log y3 = 3z, etc., and in general log yn = nz or log yn = n log y, since z = log y. If follows that the logarithm of any power of y is equal to the product of the exponent and the logarithm of y. For example logy = (z) = (log y), log1/y = log y-1/2 = -(log y), and so forth. It follows that if we know the logarithms of any number, we can find the logarithms of any power of that number. If we already know the logarithms of two numbers, for example log y = z and log v = x, since y = az and v = ax, it follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. In like manner log (y/v) = z x = log y log v, that is, the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished by the logarithm of the denominator. These rules can be used to find the logarithms of many numbers from a knowledge of the logarithms of a few. 105. From what we have seen, it follows that the logarithm of a number will not be a rational number unless the given number is a power of the base a. That is, unless the number b is a power of the base a, the logarithm of b cannot be expressed as a rational number. In case b is a power of the base a, then the logarithm of b cannot be an irrational number. If, indeed, log b = 90 n, then an = b, but this is impossible if both a and b are rational. It is especially desirable to know the logarithms of rational numbers, since from these it is possible to find the logarithms of fractions and also surds 107. There are as many different systems of logarithms as there are different numbers which can be taken as the base a. It follows that there are an infinite number of systems of logarithms. Given two different systems of logarithms, there is a constant which relates the logarithms of the same number. If. If the logarithms of all numbers have been computed in one system, then it is an easy task, by means of this golden rule for logarithms, to find the logarithms in any other system. For example, we have logarithms for the base 10. From these we can find the logarithms with any other base, for instance the base 2. We look for the logarithm of a number n for base 2, which will be q, while the logarithm with base 10 of the same number n will be p. Since for base 10, log 2 = 0.3010300 and for base 2, log 2 = 1, then p/q = 0.3010300/1 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277. If every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2. 91 Development of Logarithms Using Sequences Teacher Notes Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: The students should be familiar with the properties of logarithms and exponents and have at least an intuitive understanding of sequences.) Objective: In this activity, the students will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. Materials/Resources: Student Pages for each student; calculator (optional) Time Frame: This entire activity will probably take the equivalent of three class periods, with part of the activity sheet assigned as homework. Part 4 is the most difficult part and may be omitted if necessary. How to Use: An important thing to keep in mind as you work through this is that John Napier, the inventor of logarithms, was looking for a tool that would simplify complex mathematical calculations which were done laboriously by hand. In this project, you will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. This is an easy-to-follow activity that provides an excellent development of the meaning of logarithms. The teacher may need to do some of the exercises as guided practice to provide a direction for student answers.

S2: 2 4 8 16 32 S2: 21 22 23 24 25 64 128 26 27 256 28 512 29 1024 210 2048 211 4096 212 8192 213 The sequence S1 gives the power of 2 for the number in S2. 2. (8)(32) = 256 (512)(16) = 2924 = 213 = 8192 (128)( 4) = 2722 = 29 = 512 (There are many other possible examples.) The product is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the product of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 3. 8 in S2 corresponds to 3 in S1; 32 in S2 corresponds to 5 in S1; the product 256 corresponds to 8 = 3 + 5 in S1. In the second example, 512 corresponds to 9, 16 corresponds to 4, and the product, 8192, corresponds to 13 = 9 + 4. In the third example, 128 corresponds to 7, 4 corresponds to 2, and the product, 512, corresponds to 7 + 2 = 9. When multiplying the elements of S2, the product will always be an element of S2. This is because 2n2m = 2n+m. In words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. 32/8 = 25/23 = 25-3 = 22 = 8 512/16 = 29/24 = 29-4 = 25= 32 128/4 = 27/22 = 27-2 = 25= 32 4. 5. (There are many other possible examples.) The quotient is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the quotient of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 6. Any two terms in S2 can be divided by considering the exponents, that is, the corresponding numbers in S1, subtracting these numbers, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. 322= (25)2 = 210 = 1026 84 = (23)4 = 212 = 4096 163 = (24)3 = 212 = 4096 7. (There are many other possible examples.) The power of a term in S2 is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the power of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 93 8. Any term in S2 can be raised to a power by finding its exponent, that is, the corresponding number in S1, multiplying this number by the power, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. The easiest way would be to rewrite the number or numbers in S2 as powers of 2 and use the rules of exponents to evaluate the answer. When multiplying the numbers, add the exponents; when dividing the numbers, subtract the exponents; when raising to a power, multiply the exponent by the power. 9. Part 2 Extending the Results 10. Yes the results from part 1 hold here also. The rules of exponents hold no matter what the base is. Let u = bn and v = bm in each of the following: L(u) + L(v) = L(bn) + L(bm) =n+m = L(bn+m ) = L(bn bm ) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(bn)/L(bm) = n/m = L(bn/m ) = L(bn /bm ) = L(u/v) L(uk) = L((bn)k) = L(bnk) = nk definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u rules of exponents definition of the function l 11. 94 = k L(bn ) = k L(u) definition of the function l definition of u Part 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier 12. If we read sequence S3 from right to left, each number is 1 smaller than the one to its right. Thus we can extend it to the left by putting 0 to the left of 1 and then the negative integers to the left of 0. If we read sequence S4 from right to left, we see that each number comes from the one to its right by dividing by b. Since the number in S4 under 1 is b, the number to be put under 0 must be b/b = 1. Similarly, the number to be put under -1 must be 1/b. The number under -2 is then (1/b)/b = 1/b2, and so on. Yes the results from number 10 still hold. The rules of exponents hold for all integers. There are many examples that would be appropriate. We write 1/b as b-1; then 1/b2 = b-2. In general, we have 1/bn = b-n, because 1/bn in S4 is under -n in S3. The 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 can be written as 1 = b0. So a 0 exponent always means 1, while a negative exponent means 1 over the corresponding positive power of the base b. log 31 = __0_ log381 = __4_ log33 = _1__ log31/3 = _-1__ log39 = __2_ log3 1/243 = __-5_ log327 = _3__ log31/2187 = _-7 13. 14. 15. Part 4: Filling up the sequences 16. 1.0000001 1.0000002 1.0000003 1.0000004 1.0000005 Raising 1.0000001 to a small power seems just to be 1 with 6 decimal places after the 0 and then the small power, although with more decimal places, we would find more distinctions between the numbers. In any case, these numbers are very close together, differing by only .0000001. To get to 3, however, we would need to find n such that (1.0000001)n = 3. The calculator shows that n needs to be something near 11,000,000. It is therefore not very feasible to continue the sequence in this way. 17. We must have tt = 2 because the 1 (from + ) in S1 corresponds to 2 in S2. The solution to the equation t2 = 2 is t = 2. The calculator shows that this is equal approximately to 1.414. And since we use exponents of 2 to designate numbers in S2, we also have t = 21/2. That is, 21/2 = 2. Then log2 t = log2 2 = . Since u3 = 2, we have u = 3 2 = 1.260 = 21/3. Since v3 = 4, because 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 2 and 2 in S1 corresponds to 4 in S2, we get v = 3 4 = 1.587 = 22/3. We could also find v by 18. 95 noting that v = u2, because 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. It follows that v = ( 3 2 )2. So there are two different ways of expressing v in radical form. Also, log2 u = 1/3 and log2 v = 2/3. 19. The number corresponding to is 4 2 = 1.189 = 21/4. The number corresponding to is 4 8 = ( 4 2 )3 = 1.682 = 23/4. The number corresponding to 3/2 is 8 = (2)3 = 2.828 = 23/2. The number corresponding to 4/3 is 3 16 = ( 3 2 )4 = 2.520 = 24/3 and the number corresponding to 5/4 is 4 32 = ( 4 2 )5 = 2.378 = 25/4. The logarithms to the base 2 of these numbers are, in each case, the fraction that we began with. The number in S2 which corresponds to the fraction m/n in S1 is 2m/n. Since the nth power of this number is 2m, corresponding to the fact that the product of m/n by n is m, we can write this number as n 2 . Also, since m/n is m times 1/n, we know that 2m/n is 21/n raised to the power m. Since 21/n is equal to n 2 , we can also write 2m/n as ( n 2 )m. The calculator shows that 2317/200 = 3 (to three decimal places) and also that 2306/109 = 7 (also to three decimal places). The sum of 317/200 and 306/109 is 95753/21800 and 2 raised to that power is equal to 21, again to three decimal places. Thus 95753/21800 in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. Answers may vary. 20. 21. 22. 96 Development of Logarithms Using Sequences Student Pages Part I: Relationships Consider the two following sequences: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192 1. Rewrite the numbers in sequence S2 as powers of a single number. How are the sequences related? 2. Note that when two terms of S2 are multiplied, such as 64 and 128, their product, (64)(128) = 8192, is another term of S2. Pick a few pairs of your own to multiply. Is the product always another term of S2? You may have to extend the terms in each sequence to verify your observations. 3. Note that the number in S1 corresponding to 64 is 6, while the number in S1 corresponding to 128 is 7. The number corresponding to their product, 8192, is 13, the sum of 6 and 7. In other words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. Check that this holds for the other pairs you picked in exercise 2. 4. In a brief paragraph, summarize what you have observed. Most importantly, give a justification for your results using rules of exponents. We will now see if similar laws hold for other mathematical operations. In particular, we will examine the operations of division and taking powers. 5. Take any two terms in S2 and divide the smaller one into the larger. Do at least three cases. In each case, check the corresponding numbers in S1 of your two terms as well as their quotient. 6. After trying several pairs of terms in S2, describe how you could divide any two terms in S2 without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand. 7. Take any term in S2 and raise it to a positive integer power. Do at least three cases. Again, observe the corresponding numbers in S1 of the terms you choose and calculate. 8. After trying several cases, describe how you could raise any term in S2 to a positive integral power without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand. 97 9. From the previous problems, we have seen how to multiply, divide and raise to powers by relating terms in S1 and S2 in appropriate ways. Assume that you had no calculator or computer device at your disposal. How would these relationships help you to make complex computations? Explain! Part 2 Extending the Results At this point, we should try to generalize our findings and describe them with some more general mathematical symbols or notation. To do this, let's look at the two following sequences where b > 0. S3: S4: 1 b 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 b5 6 b6 7 b7 8 b8 9 ... b9 ... n bn We begin by defining a function, L(x), which has as its domain the elements of S4. The "value" of L(x) is its corresponding term in S3. For example L(b6)=6. In general, L(bn)=n for any positive integer n. 10. Review your results from Part 1 of the project. Do you think they hold here? In particular, use the general terms of S3 and S4 to check if the properties hold. Use algebra only to show that they are true. (Do not plug in values for b. That way, you will be showing the general relationships hold.) 11. Verify that your conclusions in number 10 are actually the following in function notation. Let u and v be terms in S4. Use algebra to show the following three properties hold. L(u) + L(v) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(u/v) L(uk) = k L(u) Part 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier Now extend the Sequence S3 and S4 to the left as follows: S3 ... -5 -4 5 S4 ... 1/b 1/b4 -3 1/b3 -2 1/b2 -1 1/b 0 1 1 b1 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 ... b5 ... 12. Why is it reasonable to extend S4 to the left in the way we did? In particular, why should the number in S4 under 0 in S3 be 1? And why should the numbers in S4 under the negative values in S3 be 1 divided by powers of b? Your explanation may well be by analogy to the development of the sequences initially. 98 13. Do the general results from number 11 still hold? Test them out by trying a few terms in S3 and S4. Show your examples. Move on when you're convinced that the rules hold for the extended sequences. 14. How can you write the quotients at the left side of S4 in exponential notation? How would you write the 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 in exponential notation? Give a brief definition of what a negative exponent means and what a 0 exponent means. At this point, recall our original sequences, S1 and S2: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192 John Napier, the Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms, called the terms of the sequence S1 the "logarithm" of the corresponding terms of the sequence S2. The word "logarithm" is a translation of the Greek word logarithmos which comes from the Greek words meaning ratio and number; it therefore means "the number that counts the ratios." For example, he called 7 the logarithm of 128. This example shows how many ratios are required for the term 128 to be found. (Note that Napier did not use base b = 2 as in S2, but the ideas are the same.) The function developed in number 11 above is a logarithmic function for base b = 2. We now replace our L notation relating numbers in S1 to those in S2 by the new notation "log2" (read as logarithm to the base 2). Thus we have the following results: log21 = 0, log22 = 1, log24 = 2 , log28 = 3, etc. 15. Use this "log" notation above to associate the corresponding terms of the following two sequences: S5 S6 0 1 1 3 2 9 3 27 4 81 5 243 6 729 7 2187 Find the following... log 31 = ___ log381 = ___ In general, log33 = ___ log31/3 = ___ log39 = ___ log3 1/243 = ___ log327 = ___ log31/2187 = ___ logba = c if and only if bc = a. This is the classic modern definition of a logarithm. 99 At this point it is very important to remember that Napier did not use this kind of notation! What we are doing here is trying to see the link between our modern logarithms and the theoretical ideas behind Napier's logarithms. Again, Napier started with two related sequences and then went in a very different direction than we do. Part 4 Filling up the sequences Recall that Napier's original motivation for developing logarithms was to replace multiplication and division by addition and subtraction. The use of these sequences enable us to do this on a very limited scale. We can, for example, by the use of sequences S1 and S2 replace the multiplication 16 times 32 by the addition 4 plus 5. And we can replace the division of 256 by 64 by the subtraction of 6 from 8. But what happens if we want to multiply 3 by 7? Neither of these numbers is in S2 and will not be even if we extend the row further to the left or right. What can we do about this? What we need is to have more numbers in S2. One way to accomplish this and this is essentially Napier's idea is to use a base much closer to 1 than our base of 2. Napier, in fact, used 1.0000001. So the first few terms of his sequences, which we will label S7 and S8 looked like the following: S7 S8 1 1.0000001 2 (1.0000001)2 3 (1.0000001)3 4 (1.0000001)4 5 (1.0000001)5 16. Use your calculator to rewrite the numbers in S8 in decimal form. What do you notice about these numbers? Given that we wanted to multiply 3 by 7, about how many numbers would we need to take in the sequence S8 in order for 3 (or even a number very close to 3) to appear? Is this feasible? Napier used some very clever ideas to shorten what looks like an impossible task. Yet he nevertheless worked over twenty years on his table. We will look a somewhat different method for putting more numbers in S2. We will first fill in S1 and then try to figure out the appropriate correspondences. We begin by putting in between the 0 and the 1. We now must determine what the corresponding number in S2 must be. We will call it t. S1 S2 0 1 1 t 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 17. To determine t, we need to use the properties of these sequences. In particular, we know that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2. Therefore, since + = 1 in S1, we must have tt = 2. (Why?) We can rewrite this equation as t2 = 2. What is t? Write the answer in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. In terms of the log2 notation, what is log2 t? 18. Now put 1/3 and 2/3 in their appropriate positions in S1. Let u be the number in S2 corresponding to 1/3 and v be the number corresponding to 2/3. Again using the property 100 that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, write an equation which u must satisfy. Solve the equation to determine u in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Then determine v similarly. (Note that instead of using the property that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, you may wish to use the property that multiplication in S1 corresponds to taking powers in S2.) What are log2 u and log2 v? 19. Now put and in their appropriate positions in S1. As in question 18, determine the corresponding numbers in S2 in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Do the same for the numbers 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 in S1. Determine the logarithm to the base 2 of each of the numbers you have now found in S2. 20. By analogy to your solutions to problems 17, 18, and 19, determine in exponential form and in radical form the number in S2 corresponding to the fraction m/n in S1. Use explicitly one or more of the properties relating S1 to S2. Since we have now filled in S1 with as many fractions as we like, we have also filled in S2 with lots of numbers. If we want to multiply 3 by 7, we now need to determine the numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 in S2. 21. The numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 are log2 3 and log2 7, respectively. Show that log2 3 is approximately equal to 317/200 and that log2 7 is approximately 306/109. You will need to use your calculator and the general definition of a logarithm. Find the sum of 317/200 and 306/109. Show that this number in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. 22. Find two other numbers to multiply by the method of exercise 21. You may have to experiment a bit with your calculator to do this. 23. Consult at least two reliable sources (other than the Internet) in the library and write a short biography of John Napier. Your account should include information not contained in this document. Also, find at least one major application of logarithms (not discussed in class) and briefly describe it. Your write up must be typed and be no more than two pages doublespaced. See me if you need resources to consult. 101 Calculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Teacher Notes Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Properties of exponents; Properties of logarithms; Definition of logarithm) Objective: The purpose of this activity is to give the students an opportunity to investigate, on a introductory level, one way that logarithms can be calculated. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator (optional) Time Frame: One class period with homework assigned to finish the student activity. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss briefly the included Historical Background with the class. The teacher may also want to review the definitions and properties of logarithms and exponents. It would be a beneficial for the teacher to work the activity before presenting it to the class especially to think about different ways to get the solutions, since some of the methods of solution are not unique. Additionally, the order in which to calculate the logarithms is not necessarily the numerical order, so the teacher will want to warn the students of this fact and perhaps give some hints about what to do when. Also note that these are base 10 logarithms that are being calculated. Bibliography Katz, Victor J., A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, Addison Wesley, 1998. 102 Calculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Solutions Part I: log 1 log 1 = y 10y = 1 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 1 y = 0. Therefore log 1 = 0 (this is true for logarithms of any base) At this point it might be best to find log 10 next since it is also easy to calculate: log 10 = y 10y = 10 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 10 y = 1. Therefore log 10 = 1 log 2 Consider the following relationship: 210 = 1024 1000 = 103 210 103 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 210 log 103 Now use the power property of logarithms: 10 log 2 3 log 10 And solve for log 2: log 2 (3 log 10)/10 = (3 1) / 10 = 0.3 So log 2 0.30 log 3 Consider the following relationship: 37 2187 2 1093 2 103 37 2 103 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 37 log (2 103) Now use the sum property of logarithms: log 37 log 2 + log 103 103 Now use the power property of logarithms: 7log 3 log 2 + 3log 10 Solve for log 3: log 3 (log 2 + 3 log 10)/7 (0.30 + 31)/7 = 3.3/7 = 0.47 So log 3 0.47 log 4 Since 4 = 22, So log 4 0.6 log 5 Since 5 = 10/2, log 5 = log (10/2) = log 10 log 2 (by the difference property of logarithms.) 1 0.30 = 0.70 So log 5 0.70 log 6 Since 6 = 23 , log 6 = log (23) = log 2 + log 3 (by the sum property of logarithms.) 0.3 + 0.47 = 0.77 So log 6 0.77 log 7 Consider the following relationship: 72 = 49 50 = 102/2 72 102/2 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 72 log 102/2 Now use the difference property of logarithms: log 72 log 102 log 2 Now use the power property of logarithms: 2 log 7 2 log 10 log 2 Solve for log 7: log 7 (2 log 10 log 2)/ 2 (21 0.30 )/2 = 1.70/2 = 0.85 So log 7 0.85 log 4 = log 22 = 2 log 2 2(0.3) = 0.6 104 log 8 Since 8 = 23, So log 8 0.90 log 9 Since 9 = 32, So log 9 0.94 log 10 log 10 = 1 (see above) Solutions for Part 2: 1. 2. Since log 1 and log 10 are exact values, an equal sign is used and since the other values are approximations, the approximately equal sign is used. Since the other numbers, such as 4, 6 and 8 are products of these prime numbers, we are able to use the approximate values for the logarithms of 2, 3 and 7. Another reason would be that there is no easy way to use the definition of logarithm to find, say log 2 since by the definition, log 2 = y 10y = 2. (Suggestion for additional activity using a graphing calculator, find the intersection of the graphs of y1 = 10x and y2 = 2, to find a value for log 2.) The values are not the same because of the approximations used in the calculations in the project. The values are not exact since approximations were used for log 2, log 3 and log 7. As an example, log 6 was found using both of the approximations for log 3 and log 2. Using a calculator, log 6 = 0.7781513, while the approximation is 0.77. The difference in values is more than 0.008. Using the calculator, log 3 = 0.4771213 and log 2 = 0.30103 while the approximations were log 3 0.47 and log 2 0.30. Both of these approximations were closer to the calculator values than that of log 6. There are many examples of other relationships such as 72 = 49 = 5 10 and so on. 5. The estimate for log 2 is too large because 210 is larger than 103 log 9 = log 32 = 2 log 3 2(0.47) = 0.94 log 8 = log 23 = 3 log 2 3(0.30) = 0.90 3. 4. 105 The estimate for log 5 is too small because the approximation for log 2 is too large and this value is subtracted from an exact value resulting in an approximation that is too small. 6. There are many approaches. One possible solution is that 112 = 121 120 = 456 Taking the log of both sides gives : 2 log 11 = log 456 = log 4 + log 5 + log 6 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.77 = 2.07 So log 11 2.07/2 log 11 1.035 (the calculator value is 1.0413927) 106 Calculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Student Pages Historical Background Briggs and Napier each spent many years in doing lengthy computations to determine logarithms. Since Napier did not use base 10 for his logarithms, but Briggs did, this project will demonstrate Briggs' approach. Keep in mind though, that we will be finding approximations for only a few common logarithms and will not have nearly the accuracy that Briggs found when he was developing his logarithm tables. Recall the definitions and properties that you know for logarithms: Definition: logb x = y by = x Sum Property of logarithms: logb(xy) = logb x + logb y Difference Property of logarithms: logb(x/y) = logb x - logb y Power Property of logarithms: logb xn = n logb x Part 1: Find approximations for the common logarithms for the positive integers 1 through 10. Recall that common logarithms are base 10 logarithms. To help get started, there are several hints of approaches to use for finding the logarithms of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 7. log 1 = _________ log 2 __________ log 2  The Fundamental Theorem (Part 2)Let f (x) be continuous and nonnegative on [a, b] and let A(x) be the area under the graph of y = f (x) over the interval [a, x].

__label__0 Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad 2011  These resources from the United Kingdom Mathematics Trust (UKMT) include the Intermediate Mathematical Olympiad and the international Kangeroo challenges.  The Olympiad is open to students in Years 9, 10 and 11 who have been invited to participate due to their being in the top 500 students in each group in the Intermediate Challenge.  The questions for Year 9 and below are to be found in the Cayley paper Year 10 in the Hamilton paper and Year 11 take the Maclaurin version.  The guidance notes are provided as an informal guide and show how it is possible to attack a difficult problem which may be unlike anything the students have ever seen before.  Some general guidance as well as three sample Olympiad questions which are discussed in detail, in an attempt to explain some of the thought processes needed when tackling them - these are not intended to be 'model' solutions!  The European Kangaroo Foundation is an international organisation based in Paris which organises the Europe-wide European Kangaroo. The name sounds strange, but recognises the fact that the European organisation was inspired by the Australian Mathematics Trust. Each year over three million school pupils across Europe (and beyond) take part at various levels. The UKMT has been involved in Kangaroo activities for several years and uses the hour-long multiple-choice papers as an extension to the Intermediate Challenge.  The solutions to all the papers are collected together in the solutions booklet

__label__0 You are here  Tips to help make Math Simple  Frustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word "Math"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.  Read the Book  Read the assigned sections over carefully and look closely at the sample problems. Decide if you benefit more by reading before or after the instructor covers the material.  Develop a Sound Math Foundation  Because most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.  Time Management  Complete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.  Calculator  Learn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.  Show Your Work  Avoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.  Organise Your Work and  Write Legibly  Write all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.  Spaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.  Be sure to line up the terms in each step of the solution, and write steps one below the other rather than to the right or left. Use lined paper or graph paper to help organise the problems on your page. Don't scrunch! Use plenty of paper to work each problem. Recycle the paper at the end of the term if you are concerned about wasting paper.  Support Services and Materials  Find out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!  Preparation and Supplies  • Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:  • Complete any previously assigned homework assignments  • Compile a list of questions about the previous assignments to ask the instructor

__label__0 Graphs are mathematical entities whose theory facilitates the discussion of the relationships between the elements of a set. Introduced about 1870 by the pioneers of combinatorics who were then still known as geometers, graphs have recently been recognized as the most adaptable tools for certain organizational problems. After first being used in operations research, graphs have now been introduced into information theory where they have proved to ba of use in many different areas. ...  This book stresses the connection between, and the applications of, design theory to graphs and codes. Beginning with a brief introduction to design theory and the necessary background, the book also provides relevant topics for discussion from the theory of graphs and codes. ...Algorithmic Graph Theory and Perfect Graphs, first published in 1980, has become the classic introduction to the field. This new Annals edition continues to convey the message that intersection graph models are a necessary and important tool for solving real-world problems. It remains a stepping stone from which the reader may embark on one of many fascinating research trails.  As graph theory continues its explosive growth, conjectures are proved and new theorems formed. The techniques involved, which have applications in a broad spectrum of mathematics, ranging from analysis to operations research, have become more sophisticated if not more manageable. This new edition, therefore, includes new theorems (e.g. the Perfect Graph Theorem, due to Lovasz) as well as new proofs of classical results. A number of sections have been significantly revised. ...  Graphs and Matrices provides a welcome addition to the rapidly expanding selection of literature in this field. As the title suggests, the book's primary focus is graph theory, with an emphasis on topics relating to linear algebra and matrix theory. Information is presented at a relatively elementary level with the view of leading the student into further research. In the first part of the book matrix preliminaries are discussed and the basic properties of graph-associated matrices highlighted.The Graphs and Models series by Bittinger, Beecher, Ellenbogen, and Penna is known for helping students "see the math" through its focus on visualization and technology. These books continue to maintain the features that have helped students succeed for years: focus on functions, visual emphasis, side-by-side algebraic and graphical solutions, and real-data applications.  This book is concerned with the relations between graphs, error-correcting codes and designs, in particular how techniques of graph theory and coding theory can give information about designs. A major revision and expansion of a previous volume in this series, this *** includes many examples and new results as well as improved treatments of older material. So that non-specialists will find the treatment accessible the authors have included short introductions to the three main topics. This book will be welcomed by graduate students and research mathematicians and be valuable for advanced courses in finite combinatorics. ...

__label__0 Book Description  Release date: August 5, 2008 | Age Range: 11 and upEditorial Reviews  About the Author  Best known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar is also an internationally recognized mathematician. She was chosen as ABC World News Tonight's "Person of the Week" for writing Math Doesn't Suck and has recently been featured in Newsweek and The New York Times, and on the CBS Early Show, and NPR's Science Friday. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this titleThis funny math book teaches girls that it's OK to be smart, and that they are perfectly capable of kicking a little pre-algebra butt.  McKellar takes a lightweight approach to math, but is deadly serious about it. In the prologue, she writes that "lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college." Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.  And it's not just fear. Girls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school. Testimonials in Kiss My Math fight this. Stephanie Perry, the finance director for Essence magazine, explains how she uses algebraic formulas to stay on top of the magazine's financial performance. Jane Davis, financial strategist at Polo Ralph Lauren, was hired as an assistant buyer because of her facility with math. She describes determining inventory over time by finding the mean of a list of numbers.  McKellar -- famous for playing Winnie Cooper in the "The Wonder Years" but also a summa cum laude math graduate from UCLA -- uses simple language and lots of illustrations to teach pre-algebra. Each chapter covers a single topic, such as the distributive property or exponents. She clearly explains each topic, and includes problems for the reader to solve (answers are in the back). The author is generous with helpful notes and shortcuts.  A lively, breezy writing style makes it seem as if McKellar is sitting next to the reader. She uses examples girls can relate to, like clothes shopping, working on the school play, blind dates, parties, kissing and breath mints. It's like having the perfect math tutor. (I'm not a middle school girl, of course, but I just got finished having one. My daughter is starting high school this month.)  Especially good are the entries called Danica's Diary, which are true stories from the author's life as a student, actress and mathematician. One is titled: Dumbing Ourselves Down for Guys: Why is it so Tempting? McKellar gives practical advice on how girls can avoid this common pitfall.  I can't think of a better book to buy for a girl taking pre-algebra.  Here's the chapter list:  Part 1: Number Stuff Chapter 1: Breath Mint, Anyone?

Do You Sudoku?  I am a mother that went back to college later in life. One of my classes was algebra. I had math anxiety and tried to find way to wiggle my way out of this class. The algebra class was very difficult for me. I could not understand the instructor or the book. I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both). So I had a six week break before I had to take the algebra class again. I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!  Danica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school.
__label__0 MATH 320 Number Systems, Statistics and Probability (5) Continuation of the development of the real numbers including applications and models of rational numbers, irrational numbers, percent, and proportional reasoning. Introduction to the basic notions of chance and probability. Introduction to data analysis and statistics. This course involves substantial use of 2- and 3-dimensional concrete materials in a cooperative learning setting. Prerequisites: A grade of C- or better in MATH 221. (4 units lecture and 1 unit activity).  Objectives: Mathematics 320 is the second of a sequence of three courses designed to help students gain the mathematical knowledge, skills, and understanding that are essential for those pursuing a Multiple Subject Credential as prescribed by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Students will identify and prioritize relevant and missing information in mathematical problems. They will analyze complex problems to identify similar simple problems that might suggest solution strategies. They will explain their mathematical reasoning through a variety of methods, such as words, numbers, symbols, charts, graphs, tables, diagrams, and concrete models. They will use appropriate mathematical notation with clear and accurate language. They will explain how to derive a result based on previously developed ideas and explain how a result is related to other ideas.  Demonstrate an understanding of functions with domain the rational numbers.  Demonstrate an understanding of decimals and operations on decimals.  Demonstrate an understanding of nonterminating decimals.  Demonstrate an understanding of real numbers.  Demonstrate an understanding of ratios, proportions and proportional reasoning.  Demonstrate an understanding of percents.  Demonstrate an understanding of probabilities.  Perform experiments with tree diagrams and geometric probabilities.  Using simulations in probability.  Demonstrate an understanding of odds, conditional probability and expected value.  Draw sensible conclusions from displayed data.  Demonstrate an understanding of measures of central tendency and variation.  Demonstrate an understanding when statistics is abused.  Note: Although some attention will be given to how to teach mathematics effectively to children, this is a content course, not a methods course. Methodology is the primary focus of the Credential Program.  Class Meetings: MW: 10:50-12:30 pm, Science III 103.  Th: 10:30-12:30 pm, Science III 103.  Textbook (required): Custom edition of A Problem Solving Approach to Mathematics for Elementary Teachers, 10th ed, Part 1, by Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott, and a packet of labs taken from Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers An Activity Approach, by Bennett, Burton, and Nelson. Sections of the text being covered in lecture should be read prior to coming to class. Lectures will not cover all topics from each section, but students will be responsible for all topics in the section.  Supplies: In addition to the textbook, each student must have a scientific calculator, several colored pencils, and 1/4-inch graph paper. These should be brought to class with you each day.  Homework: Mathematics is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Although homework assignments will not be collected, it is assumed that you will do the homework necessary for success in this class. We will spend considerable time at the beginning of each lecture working out homework problems. Answers to most of the assigned problems are in the back of the book. If you are not able to solve a particular problem, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates will be grateful.  Readings: The student is responsible for reading at least twice each section of the book covered in class: Before and after the lecture. The student will be told in advance what sections of the book are to read. If you are not able to understand something in the book, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates will be grateful.  Quizzes: There will be seven quizzes, each of them administered most Thursdays at 10:35 pm; the student will be able to drop the lowest score. Quizzes may not be made-up. If you miss a quiz you will get a score of "0" (zero) recorded. You may take any quizearly with the instructor's permission. Problems will be similar to those in the homework or in the preceding activity. The primary purpose of these quizzesis to provide you with frequent evaluation of your content acquisition and to help you to reduce math anxiety. Quiz work is individual, see Note 2 below.  Activities: Seven activity assignments will be collected; the student will be able to drop the lowest score. Activity attendance is required: Most Thursdays 10:50-12:30. The student should work in groups of at least 3 people and 4 at most. During activity sessions the student will work on an activity sheet and each member of his/her group should hand in a report at the beginning of next Thursday at the latest. Activity work must be turned in on the activity pages from the packet. Late reports and reports from students absent from even one meeting will not be accepted. A report should be neat and readable; solutions should follow an increasing numerical sequence. Each member of a group will receive the same number of points, so it is your responsibility to write down in each report only the names of those who substantially contributed to the activity.  Exams: There will be two Midterm exams and a cumulative final. Questions and problems will deal with concepts discussed in lectures, homework, textbook, and activities. Exchange of information, calculators, and supplies is absolutely prohibited during exams! To clarify a particular situation, the instructor reserves the right to a further examination, written or oral. Exam work is individual, see Note 2 below. Midterm exams may not be made-up. If you miss an exam you will get a score of "0" (zero) recorded. You may take any exam early with the instructor's permission.  Partial Credit: Only substantial contributions to the solution of a problem will count for partial credit. Mere restating of a problem or the quoting of an incorrect fact, for example, will not make you eligible for it. Students must watch out for logical mistakes, and must make sure that all the hypotheses are met before recalling a particular theorem.  Grades: Your final grade is a function of the total of points awarded on the activities indicated above. Group homework is very helpful and greatly promoted in this course. However, it is necessary for college graduates to demonstrate individual competency on the subject. Therefore, regardless of your total of points, in order to get a D- or better in this course all of the following should be fulfilled at least:  (a) To have scored at least 200 points in the 2 Midterm exams combined.  (b) To have scored at least 105 points in the final exam.  Generally, the following guidelines for grades apply:  960 -1000 A 900 - 959 A-  870 - 899 B+ 840 - 869 B 800 - 839 B-  770 - 799 C+ 740 - 769 C 700 - 739 C-  670 - 699 D+ 640 - 669 D 600 - 639 D-  0- 599 F  If you entered the liberal studies program on Fall 2011, you are required to get a C or better in all classes that you are taking for your major - this includes Math 320.  Notes:  1) It is the student's responsibility to find out what (s)he missed if (s)he did not attend class. Office hours are not meant for tutorial courses, but rather to clarify particular situations or problems occurring during lectures, homework, labs, assignments or readings. Students are encouraged to make use of the Office Hours.  3) The instructor will hold graded papers for one week at most. After this period, he will trash old papers. Contact him as soon as you foresee a problem picking up your paper(s).  4) All handouts (with solutions) will be in the internet (follow the link Math 320 in   5) Beepers, cell phones, i-pods, laptops and similar electronic devices must be turned off at all times during class or lab time. If not, the student will have to leave the room without being allowed to return.  6) Students can be at most 10 minutes late. Students cannot leave the room, unless it is for medical reasons.

__label__0 Statistical Mechanics  The theory of knots and models of simple magnets have suddenly become interwowen over the last two decades. Both fields have benefitted from this interaction - with ideas in one helping solve problems in the other. This course shows how progress in pure mathematics can help understand problems in apparently totally unrelated branches of science - this interaction is typical of modern mathematical physics which has blurred the distinction between pure and applied mathematics on many fronts. No pre requisites from applied mathematics or statisics courses are necessary for this module.
__label__0 The book I used in my 'proofs' class was "Doing Mathematics: An Introduction to Proofs and Problem Solving" by Steven Galovich, here on Amazon.  The class was called "Mathematical Structures", which is an apt name since the class wasn't solely about learning to prove things. It was learning to prove things in the context of learning about basic mathematical objects. It starts with basic logic, but after it introduces sets, relations, functions, equivlance relations and the like, it goes onto to develop the ideas of cardinality, including Cantor-Bernstein. It also has a couple other topics, like some basic combinatorics, the constructions of number systems, or looking at consequences of the field axioms.  It was a great introduction to what math is "really about" coming after some mostly computational calculus and linear algebra courses. The price is about $50, so it is a little more than you were looking for. But it is absolutely a book worth having.

Learn more  Book DescriptionMore About the Authors  Product Description  Review  "This beautifully written book can be recommended to any cultivated person with a certain sophistication of thought, and also to the practicing mathematician who will find here a vantage point from which to make a tour d'horizon of his science." --Publ. Math. Debrecen "This is an unusual book, being more a book about mathematics than a mathematics book. It includes mathematical issues, but also questions from the philosophy of mathematics, the psychology of mathematical discovery, the history of mathematics, and biographies of mathematicians, in short, a book about the mathematical experience broadly considered… The book found its way into "Much for liberal arts students" courses and into education courses directed at future teachers. Term paper topics, essay assignments, problems, computer applications, and suggested readings are included. This new material should greatly enhance the usefulness of this very creative book. The range of topics covered is immense and the contents cannot easily be summarized. The book makes excellent casual reading, would make a good textbook, or could easily be used as a supplement to nearly any course concerned with mathematics." -Zentralblatt Math "This is a people-centered book about mathematics, and as such it provides an opportunity to explore fundamental issues that are typically absent from the experience of most college and university students (as well as their teachers). This new edition provides an excellent initiation of students into some of the more challenging aspects of mathematics…The study edition of The Mathematical Experience will help its readers acquire a real understanding of mathematics." -Notices of the AMS "Two distinguished mathematicians...have written a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor..." --The New Yorker (1984 American Book Award Edition)  Back in the early 90's when I was an almost-penniless mathematics student I was standing in front of a bookshelf in my local bookstore and had to choose between this and Gödel, Escher, Bach. I chose this book and I still don't regret it. [I have also subsequently bought GEB :-)] Driven by their obvious love of the subject, the authors do a credible job of tackling just what it is about mathematics that makes mathematicians love it so much, often to the bafflement of the rest of the world. A particular personal favourite is the series of four conversations between an "ideal mathematician" and, respectively, a University Public Information Officer, a philosophy student, a positive philosopher and a sceptical classicist. I would recommend this book to students of mathematics at any level beyond the elementary, especially those with an interest in the foundations of their subject. The authors do however acknowledge that some parts of the book will seem alien to the layman.  If you are the kind of person who enjoys Horizon and other science programs but wishes they were less stripped of technicalities and more in depth: if you are very curious about physics and mathematics, you may find this a very stimulating read. After all you don't need to be a good comedian to enjoy watching comedy, so with little mathematical knowledge you can enjoy this very wide ranging discussion of many exotic fields of maths and gain a sense of the range and significance and methodologies of this field at the outer limits of human abstract thought. This very readable, demanding, though provoking book that can occupy you for weeks and sustain several re-readings.  Around my early to mid teens, finding the mathematics I was being taught easy but also puzzling I started to have philosophical questions that were just not properly addressed. I later hoped (naively I now know) my Science/Engineering degree would answer those questions. It didn't. I had wanted to dig deeper into what mathematics is but instead was taught increasingly obscure and complex "results" that were useful to my discipline. Had I known it at the time this book would have answered my questions (often answering them with more questions, true). It appears to give an excellent framework to the consideration of any uneasiness you might feel with mathematics especially if you find/found school levels maths easy.  If after reading this you still feel uneasy then you know you need to proceed further into philosophy.

__label__0 3: Communicate the breadth and interconnections of the mathematical sciences  Every course should strive to:  Present key ideas and concepts from a variety of perspectives;  Employ a broad range of examples and applications to illustrate and motivate the material;  Promote awareness of connections to other subjects (both in and out of the mathematical sciences), and strengthen each student ability to apply the course material to these subjects;  Introduce contemporary topics from the mathematical sciences and their applications, and enhance student perceptions of the vitality and importance of mathematics in the modern world.  Key Ideas and Concepts from Varied Perspectives  Project Intermath is an interdisciplinary mathematics project that is creating curricula at the United StatesMilitaryAcademy, CarrollCollegeGeorgiaCollege & StateUniversity, HarveyMuddCollege, MacalesterCollege, University of Redlands, and the Texas Southern Consortium. By working with professors from science, engineering, mathematics and computer science departments, the project aims to foster the creation of interdisciplinary courses that demonstrate the interdependence of mathematics and science. For example, at the United StatesMilitaryAcademy , first semester students study the concept of change from both a discrete and a continuous point of view. At the end of the semester students must model and solve particular problems by using a discrete dynamical system and by using a differential equation. Students then compare and discuss the appropriateness and the results of the two approaches. Within the four-course core program, students at the United States Military Academy also examine mathematical topics from the perspectives of linear versus nonlinear and stochastic versus deterministic. At Carroll College, a 4-class core consisting of a total of 18 credit hours covers many of the topics seen in the first two years of a traditional curriculum, including differential and integral calculus, multivariable calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The core also includes topics not usually seen early, if at all: discrete dynamical systems, partial differential equations, probability, and statistics. Concepts are threaded together in and between classes to help students develop a deeper understanding of how different branches of mathematics are intertwined. The website contains complete texts for over 40 modeling problems developed at the United StatesMilitaryAcademy site.  Although a number of the textbooks produced during the calculus reform movement are no longer in print, both mainstream and reform texts now consider the concepts of calculus from a variety of perspectives: not only the symbolic, but also the graphical, numerical, and verbal. The Calculus Consortium at Harvard Newslettersdiscuss issues involved in teaching calculus. Many calculus texts now come with software to enhance student understanding from a variety of perspectives.  A good source of ideas on how to teach linear algebra from various perspectives is Resources for Teaching Linear Algebra, edited by David Carlson, Charles R. Johnson, David Lay, Duane Porter, Ann Watkins, and William Watkins, MAA Notes vol. 42.  The concept of function can be regarded from many different perspectives and is important in all undergraduate mathematics courses. The editors of The Concept of Function: Aspects of Epistemology and Pedagogy (Harel & Dubinsky, 1992) contributed to the body of research on learning the function concept in order to assist in instructional approaches. Key Aspects of Knowing and Learning the Concept of Function by Marilyn Carlson and Michael Oehrtman is a recent online article that provides a broad view of the subject.  Victor Donnay, BrynMawrCollege, developed a PowerPoint presentation describing how computer visualization can be used to give an intuitive understanding of complex ideas in modern mathematics.  Promote Awareness of Connections between Mathematics and Other Subjects  Applications  Dan Maki (Indiana University Bloomington) and Bart Ng (Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis) co-direct the NSF-funded project Mathematics Throughout the Curriculum. The website includes links to a prototype course Analytical Problem Solving and a set of Home Pages for Developing Courses, which contain additional information about courses that relate mathematics to the life sciences, business and economics, the humanities and social sciences, and the physical sciences and engineering. A newsletter provides additional information about the project.  The MAA'sJournal of Online Mathematics and its Applications (JOMA) contains peer-reviewed articles, class-tested, web-based learning materials, and self-contained, dynamic, single-purpose learning tools. Many of these illustrate a range of examples and applications and connections between mathematics and other subjects. Some recent articles are Special Relativity and Conic Sections, Designing Attribute Acceptance Sampling Plans, and Art and Design in Mathematics.  DukeUniversity's Connected Curriculum Project collects and develops interactive learning materials for mathematics and its applications, with applications to biology, chemistry, economics, engineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, and physics. Each application is keyed to the level of mathematics used.  The MAA'sDigital Classroom Resources provides a select collection of learning materials that are available without charge through the site. These materials have been classroom tested and peer reviewed. Many items in the library include editorial reviews and links to a moderated discussion group focused on the materials.  The entry for the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) in the bibliography contains additional information about incorporating real-world applications into mathematics courses.  History  The MAA's online journal Convergence is a new online magazine that provides resources to help teach mathematics using its history. ReinhardLaubenbacher, David Pengelley, Jerry Lodder, and others at New MexicoStateUniversity have developed a large collection of instructional materials to teach mathematics using original historical sources. Other books that link mathematical topics with their history include William Dunham's Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics and The Calculus Gallery, Simon Singh's Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem and The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography, Rudy Rucker'sInfinity and the Mind: The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite, and Marcia Ascher'sEthnomathematics. A Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas. Judith Grabiner of PitzerCollege developed two general education courses with an emphasis on history: Mathematics, Philosophy, and the 'Real World,' and Mathematics in Many Cultures.  Art  In a note to Project NExT participants, Doris Schattschneider, Moravian College, gave the following list of websites for courses linking mathematics, art, and design: * Survey course on mathematics in art and architecture by Paul Calter at Dartmouth College * Course on Mathematics in Art by HelmerAskalan * Course in Mathematics and Art by Marc Franz * Jill Britton's website on Symmetry and Tessellations, with annotated links to many other sites on these and related topics * Totally Tessellated (can be accessed from Britton's site) * A mini-site on Escher's work and related math * An exhibit by artists whose work has been influenced by M.C. Escher featured at the Escher Centennial Congress in Rome in 1998 * A website about harmony and proportion by John Boyd-Brent, M.A, Royal College of Art * This website, related to a 'technical' paper by D. Schattschneider and N. Dolbilin, has Java applets that allow users to manipulate flexible tilings.  Most textbooks for general education mathematics courses include sections that connect mathematics with other fields. For instance, The Heart of Mathematics: An invitation to effective thinking by Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird discusses the mathematics of bar codes, cryptography, geometry and art, fractals and chaos, and the likelihood of coincidences. A syllabus for an interesting course that makes some use of this text is from Sarah Greenwald, Appalachian State University. Another text, Using and Understanding Mathematics by Jeffrey O. Bennett and William L. Briggs, University of Colorado at Boulder, contains sections on financial management, modeling a variety of real-world situations, mathematics and art, mathematics and music, mathematics and politics, and mathematics and business. See also the listings in this section under "Introduce Contemporary Topics."  Introduce Contemporary Topics  Robert Devaney, BostonUniversity, is a leader in promoting instruction in the contemporary topic of dynamical systems. In addition to his books and articles, talks, and professional development institutes, he has been director of the National Science Foundation's Dynamical Systems and Technology Project since 1989. The goal of this project is to show students and teachers how ideas from modern mathematics such as chaos, fractals, and dynamics, together with modern technology, can be used effectively in the high school and college curriculum.  The University of Maryland University College offers Mathematics – Contemporary Topics and Applications as both an in-class and distance-learning first-year course. The course is a survey of contemporary topics in mathematics, centering on applications and projects. Topics include measurements, rates of growth, basic statistics, the mathematics of political power, the geometry of the solar system, and computer arithmetic. The goals state that after completing this course a student should be able to cite elements of good statistical design, undertake elementary statistical analysis, and recognize and explain the shortcomings of unsound methods of statistical analysis; mathematically analyze situations involving the weighting of power in various voting structures and implement apportionment of power strategies; and use the Pythagorean theorem and properties of similar triangles to calculate sizes of and distance between objects, including astronomical objects.  StetsonUniversity offers a wide variety of courses that meet the general mathematics requirement, including many that discuss contemporary topics such as chaos and fractals, game theory, and cryptology.  Both of the popular texts For All Practical Purposes, produced by the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications, and Excursions in Modern Mathematics by Peter Tannenbaum and Robert Arnold aim to convey insight about topics in contemporary mathematics and its applications to undergraduate students who have limited mathematical backgrounds. Topics in these books include the mathematics of voting, fair division, and apportionment, applications of graph theory to management science, fractal geometry, and statistics.  At Mount Holyoke College George Cobb teaches a course on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC), "a very general and powerful method for computer simulation of situations that are too complicated to handle using more conventional mathematical methods. MCMC has become a very active area of research at the interface of computer science and statistics, and has had a powerful impact on the practice of data analysis. As a method for computer simulation, MCMC has very broad applicability. As a branch of mathematics, MCMC offers a number of compelling surprises – structures that on a concrete level seem quite different, but, viewed at the right level of abstraction, turn out to be different versions of the same idea."  In the article "Geometric Photo Manipulation" Tom Farmer shows how calculus and linear algebra can be used to manipulate photographs, a contemporary application with which many students have experience, thanks to currently available software.  G.H. Hardy once proudly asserted that number theory would never be applied. Yet today number theory has a range of important applications. Among these are cryptography (see, for example, lecture notes from two cryptography courses by Ed Schaefer at Santa Clara University, the RSA website, and recent textbooks in number theory and discrete mathematics), and error detection using check digits and error-correcting codes (see, for example, Numbers and symmetry: An Introduction to Algebraby Bernard L. Johnston and Fred Richman and Contemporary Abstract Algebra by Joseph Gallian).  Enhance Perception of Vitality and Importance of Mathematics  The World Wide Web provides a wealth of examples of the use and applicability of mathematics, but searching for appropriate illustrations can be time consuming. There are several sites that focus on providing good examples for instructors: Plus, an Internet magazine that aims to introduce readers to the beauty and the practical applications of mathematics; Mathematical Moments, an AMS program that offers a series of pdf files and podcasts to promote appreciation and understanding of the role mathematics plays in science, nature, technology, and human culture; and the Math Forum, a center that provides resources, materials, activities, person-to-person interactions, and educational products and services to enrich and support the teaching and learning of mathematics.  Chance News is a monthly, on-line newsletter that provides abstracts of articles from current newspapers, the media, and journals, and suggests discussion questions for class use. It also includes links to related resources at other web sites. Since 1992, Chance News has been maintained by J. Laurie Snell of DartmouthCollege. The examples are current and can be used for student motivation, for class discussion, and as exercises in an introductory statistics course or probability course. The website contains all issues of Chance News as well as information on signing up for the newsletter by e-mail.  Additional Resources  Additional information and resources on communicating the breadth and interconnections of the mathematical sciences are in Part 2, Section C.3.
__label__0 MAT 230 - Discrete Mathematics  Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. That is, in contrast to the real numbers that vary continuously, the objects of study in discrete mathematics take on distinct, separated values. Topics include operations on sets, logic, truth tables, counting, relations and digraphs, functions, trees and graph theory. A significant goal of this course is to improve students' critical-thinking and problem-solving skills.

__label__0 Purchasing Options  Features  Presents a thorough but accessible introduction to real analysis by starting with extensions of calculus before introducing the axiomatic method  Uses a historical perspective to make real analysis more interesting and less intimidating  Supplements the main development with auxiliary topics, such as formal logic, infinite products, continued fractions, rearrangement of infinite series, and root finding  Assists learning with numerous exercises, figures, and tables  Supports an optional one-semester introduction to analysis, allowing stronger students to join in the second semester  Summary  Most volumes in analysis plunge students into a challenging new mathematical environment, replete with axioms, powerful abstractions, and an overriding emphasis on formal proofs. This can lead even students with a solid mathematical aptitude to often feel bewildered and discouraged by the theoretical treatment. Avoiding unnecessary abstractions to provide an accessible presentation of the material, A Concrete Introduction to Real Analysis supplies the crucial transition from a calculations-focused treatment of mathematics to a proof-centered approach.  Drawing from the history of mathematics and practical applications, this volume uses problems emerging from calculus to introduce themes of estimation, approximation, and convergence. The book covers discrete calculus, selected area computations, Taylor's theorem, infinite sequences and series, limits, continuity and differentiability of functions, the Riemann integral, and much more. It contains a large collection of examples and exercises, ranging from simple problems that allow students to check their understanding of the concepts to challenging problems that develop new material.  Providing a solid foundation in analysis, A Concrete Introduction to Real Analysis demonstrates that the mathematical treatments described in the text will be valuable both for students planning to study more analysis and for those who are less inclined to take another analysis class.
__label__0 The skills that students are practicing in related rates problems are:  Differentiating a known equation implicitly with respect to time.  Interpreting the time derivative of a quantity as a rate of change.  The main reason that related rates problems feel so contrived is that calculus books do not want to assume that the students are familiar with any of the equations of science or economics. Every related rates problem inherently involves differentiating a known equation, and the only equations that the calculus book assumes are the equations of geometry.  Thus, you can find related rates problems involving various area and volume formulas, related rates problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem or similar triangles, related rates problems involving triangle trigonometry, and so forth. A few of these problems are compelling -- for example, computing the speed of an airplane based on ground observations of its altitude and apparent angular velocity -- but most of them do feel a bit contrived.  The reality, of course, is that students are familiar with many of the basic equations and concepts of science and economics, and there's no rule against using these in problems. For example, you can make up all sorts of compelling related rates problems by starting with any physics or chemistry equation and imagining a situation where you might want to take its derivative:  The kinetic energy of an object is $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the object is accelerating at a rate of $9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2$, how fast is the kinetic energy increasing when the speed is $30 \;\text{m}/\text{s}$?  An ideal gas satisfies $PV = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R \approx 8.314\;\; \text{J}\; \text{mol}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}$. Give the rate at which the temperature and volume of the gas are increasing, and then ask about the rate of change in pressure when the volume and temperature reach certain amounts.  The total energy stored in a capacitor is $\frac{1}{2} Q^2 / C$, where $Q$ is the amount of charge stored in the capacitor and $C$ is the capacitance. Give the value of $C$ and the rate at which $Q$ is decreasing, and ask about the rate at which the capacitor is losing energy when the energy is a certain amount.  In astronomy, the absolute magnitude $M$ of a star is related to its luminosity $L$ by the formula $$ M \;=\; M_{\text{sun}} -\; 2.5\; \log_{10}(L/L_{\text{sun}}). $$ where $M_{\text{sun}} = 4.75$ and $L_{\text{sun}} = 3.839 \times 10^{26} \text{watts}$. (Note that, by convention, brighter stars have lower magnitude.) If the absolute magnitude of a variable star is decreasing at a rate of $0.09 / \text{week}$, how quickly is the luminosity of the star increasing when the magnitude is $3.8$?  It's easy to make these up: just think of any equation in science or economics whose derivative might be interesting. Wikipedia and/or science textbooks can be helpful for finding equations from a wide variety of fields.

__label__0 Mathematics  Many of our students are destined to be leaders in fields where analytical and problem-solving skills are invaluable and specific applications of mathematics are often indispensable. In the Mathematics Department, we give each student the necessary tools to understand theories and appreciate applications. True problem-solving strength calls for a wide repertoire of knowledge. Students acquire a strong knowledge of mathematics through the study of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus.  This ability to solve problems is further strengthened by learning to discern relationships between particular skills and concepts and the fundamental principles that unify them. Students learn to formulate key questions, analyze data, and apply learned strategies to new situations. In doing so, students are equipped not only to solve mathematics problems, but also to use an analytical, well-thought-out approach in seeking solutions in other areas of life.  Algebra I  This class introduces the basic principles of future mathematics courses. Students transition from the concrete to the abstract through a wide range of problem-solving situations. The class emphasizes the concept of functions and covers the real number system, operations with positive and negative numbers, simplifying algebraic expressions, solving and graphing linear equations and inequalities, applying rules of exponents, understanding operations involving polynomials, simplifying rational expressions and square roots, and solving both rational and quadratic equations.  Algebra II  This second-year course in algebra aims for a mastery of the manipulative skills in real-number algebra as well as further develop problem-solving skills. Students review and extend their ability to manipulate polynomial and rational expressions and to solve linear, quadratic, fractional, and radical equations and inequalities. The course includes the study of irrational and complex numbers and concludes with an introduction to exponential and logarithmic functions. Placement in this course is based on teacher recommendations following the completion of Algebra I and Geometry.  Algebra II Trigonometry  This second-year course in algebra aims for a mastery of the manipulative skills in real-number algebra. Students review and extend their ability to manipulate polynomial and rational expressions and to solve linear, quadratic, fractional, and radical equations and inequalities. An introduction to the concepts of rational exponents, functions, logarithms, sequences, and series is provided. The course concludes with instruction in elementary trigonometry.  Algebra II Honors  Emphasis in this course is on step-by-step solutions. The pace is set to challenge students with high mathematical abilities. To participate, students must have a strong recommendation from their previous mathematics teachers. This second year of algebra begins with a review of the principles learned in Algebra I and proceeds into greater complexities, with subsequent introduction of the elements of exponents, functions, logarithms, trigonometry, sequences, and series.  Geometry  This course introduces students to concepts in geometry and teaches how to write a two-column proof. Basic algebraic skills are reinforced throughout this course with special emphasis on applications of congruence and similarity of triangles, properties of circles, areas of plane figures, and volumes of solids.  Geometry Honors  Geometry Honors is a course for students who have genuine interest and high aptitude in mathematics. In this course, students gain a greater appreciation of the nature of a mathematical system through the study of mathematical proofs. Other topics emphasized are application of congruence and similarity of triangles, properties of circles, areas of plane figures, and volumes of solids. Also, inductive and deductive reasoning are discussed, and algebraic concepts are reinforced through the study of coordinate geometry.  Nature of Math  This course will provide students with the opportunity to broaden their mathematic experience, to learn what mathematicians do, and to understand how mathematical thinking may be useful to them in their daily lives. This course is designed for students who have successfully completed Algebra II and wish to further their mathematical studies. Though an interactive exploration of mathematics, students will study and appreciate various aspects of mathematics: the internal structure, the history, problem-posing and problem-solving techniques, and the inherent connections with other disciplines. In addition, students will study the properties of geometric structures through building polyhedra. This will enrich their spatial intuition, and enable them to communicate the joy of artistic creation through mathematics.  Statistics  The aim of the Statistics course is to introduce students to the major concepts or traditional and modern statistics, to gain the tools for collecting, properly analyzing and drawing conclusions from statistical data, and to gain an understanding of statistical methods relevant to an interdisciplinary application. Descriptive statistics, elementary probability theory; laws of probability, and random variables are among the themes explored in the class. The course is paced in such a way that solid math students will be challenged.  Pre-Calculus  This course is an introduction to analysis. The intent is to utilize all the mathematical concepts developed in previous mathematics courses and to sum up the basic concepts of mathematics. In preparation for college-level calculus, Pre-Calculus integrates a number of topics, including functions, inverse functions, theory of logarithms, functional trigonometry, polynomial equations, probability, and statistics.  Pre-Calculus Honors  Pre-Calculus Honors offers a challenging introduction to the study of analysis after a brief review of basic mathematical concepts. As a sequel to Algebra II Honors, prerequisites include successful completion of the preceding honors courses or a strong recommendation from the algebra teacher in collaboration with the Mathematics Department. This course integrates a number of topics, including an in-depth study of functions, theory of logarithms, trigonometry, polynomial equations, and statistics. Students are also introduced to limits and the interpretation of computation of derivatives.  Calculus  Calculus provides students with solid preparation for college-level mathematics courses. It begins with a brief reinforcement of skills learned through Pre-Calculus. Major concentration for the rest of the year centers on the study of limits, derivatives, integrals, and their respective applications.  Calculus AP AB  Calculus Advanced Placement AB offers students the opportunity to take a college-level mathematics course and receive college credit with success on the Advanced Placement examination. Using both a calculus textbook and a syllabus set forth for Calculus AB in the College Board's Acorn Book, this course challenges students at a level that prepares them to take advanced mathematics courses in college.

Customer Reviews:  I doubt that there's a better supplemental DE book out there  By Fugazi - September 22, 2004  I used this book for an introductory differential equations course. With the help of this book, I was completely prepared for everything the professor threw at us and more.  Some of the problems are simple and should help to reinforce the basic concepts learned from another book. Learn the fundamentals from some other book (or even a professor), and refine your thought processes using this one. There are some basic explanations of concepts and problem types, but most of the space is devoted to problems and solutions, as you may have guessed. If I had trouble with a problem from another book, I could almost always find a similar one in the REA book. A few problems are extremely difficult or involved, but the book leads you through every step of every problem. I was blown away by the depth of a few problems, but following the reasoning in this book really helped me to develop a better "feel" for the subject.  Excellent  By A Customer - July 1, 2001  This is an excellent supplement to any Differential Equations class. It starts out with easy and straight forward problems and progressively gets to the more advanced problems. All steps are worked out in an easy to understand way. Most importantly this book shows the algebraic steps in obtaining solutions, which is ussually where students have trouble. This book is a must have for any science major.  An Excellent Resource!  By A Customer - June 15, 2001  If you are studying DEs, get this book!

What's inside... Feature Math and Science Magnet Prepares Students for Algebra and Beyond What's New  Math and Science Magnet Prepares Students for Algebra and Beyond Algebra is an important foundation for building the critical thinking skills we need for solving everyday problems. Picture yourself at the local video rental store getting ready to pay for your selection. The clerk tells you that you have a choice of paying a $25 annual membership fee, plus $1.50 per rental, or paying no membership fee and $2.75 per rental. Would you have imagined that an understanding of algebra and linear equations could help you decide which is the better deal? Or perhaps you have a job offer that requires you to move across the country from Buffalo, N.Y. to San Francisco, Calif., but you would have to cover the cost of gas for approximately 2600 miles in a moving van. If the national average for gasoline is $3.25 per gallon, how much money would you need to save to cover the cost of the move? Would you have believed that when you learned to solve algebraic expressions it would help you find the answer to this unknown variable, too?  There is concern throughout the country that many American students lack the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in algebra. Those students may not only have greater difficulty solving some of the "real world" problems listed above, but they also may need remedial course work in college and may have a lesser chance of becoming the next generation of American scientists, inventors, and engineers. And with research showing that students who complete Algebra II in high school are more than twice as likely than students with less mathematical preparation to earn a 4-year college degree, we must ensure that students are ready to tackle the more advanced mathematics courses in high school and beyond.  To compete in the 21st century global economy, proficiency in mathematics is crucial. To help ensure our nation's future competitiveness and economic viability, President George W. Bush created the National Mathematics Advisory Panel in April 2006. The Panel was charged with making recommendations on the best use of scientifically based research to advance the teaching and learning of mathematics. During the past two years, the Panel held meetings around the country, reviewed more than 16,000 research studies, received public testimony from 110 individuals, and considered written commentary from numerous organizations and individuals. In addition, the Math Panel conducted, in partnership with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), a national survey of Algebra I teachers to determine what practices will best prepare American students to succeed in algebra. On March 13, 2008, the 24 expert panelists, including educators, cognitive psychologists, and leading mathematicians, released a report with actionable steps, containing 45 findings and recommendations on numerous topics. Some of these topics included instructional practices, materials, professional development for teachers, learning processes, assessments and research policies, and mechanisms. The report calls for students to attain a strong foundation in basic mathematical skills and for Americans to redefine how they view mathematics, shifting from a belief that particular people cannot learn mathematics to a belief that hard work and effort can pay dividends in achievement.  Some of the report's key findings include: 1.) there should be a systematic progression in mathematics curricula from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with an emphasis on student mastery of each step; 2.) it is critical to understand and be able to work with fractions (including decimals, percents, and negative fractions), for such proficiency is foundational for algebra; 3.) it is crucial for students to demonstrate quick recall of computational facts if they are to be successful in mathematics; 4.) a student's effort in the learning process is an important factor to ensuring achievement; and 5.) teachers must have a strong understanding of mathematics both prior to and beyond the level they instruct, if students are to succeed.  The K J Clark Middle School of Mathematics, Science & Technology in Chickasaw, Ala., is a magnet school that provides a curriculum rich with many of these recommendations, and the school is producing impressive results for its students. Clark offers a rigorous and relevant mathematics curriculum with a multitude of hands-on activities to get students excited about learning. As the National Math Panel report recommends, the school's approach is systematic and emphasizes conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem-solving skills.  Under the leadership of Principal Dianne McWain, a 2007 U.S. Department of Education Terrell H. Bell award recipient, fourth through eighth grade students throughout the Mobile County are being prepared to succeed in mathematics and science in high school and beyond. McWain notes, "We accelerated learning a few years ago. Now our students are so much better prepared. We integrate mathematics into the curriculum everyday and in every class."  The mathematics program allows students to see what is important, according to Math Department Chair Julie Boren. For example, in one algebra class, the students work in groups as they tackle a question involving which one of three candidates won the school's student council election, and by how many votes. "They know we are not going to skip the word problems just because they are difficult. We meet challenges head-on," she said.  The school prepares students for algebra by providing a "core plus" curriculum. The "core plus" takes place in grades four through six, during which time the mathematics instructors teach the grade level county curriculum but add skills from the next grade level as well. By accelerating instruction, all seventh grade students are prepared for the foundations of algebra and all eighth grade students are taught Algebra I for high school credit. Clark also offers geometry for more advanced eighth graders. "We add skills in the sixth and seventh grade that students may need to ensure they take and pass Algebra I in eighth grade," said Boren.  Clark also offers an after-school tutoring program, an in-house tutoring program that removes students from their scheduled classes to obtain extra help, and one-on-one sessions during class with the teacher to ensure that all students, even those who are struggling initially, succeed in the rigorous math program. "It is critical that our students be competitive - it opens doors for them so they can take calculus and upper level math in high school," Boren asserts.  Student enrollment at Clark is determined by a lottery in which there are no academic requirements for admission other than passing the grade the student is in at the time of application. Students come to Clark from parochial or private schools and as many as 60 public elementary schools across the county. The students also arrive with very different backgrounds and levels of academic ability. Teachers work collaboratively to bridge the gap between students' initial levels of knowledge and experience and Clark's standards of proficiency required for promotion.  The U.S. Department of Education named Clark a No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Blue Ribbon School in 2007 in part because it is a high achieving school regardless of its student demographic. Although 58 percent of Clark's student population consists of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, all students have improved their performance on state assessments. Beginning in 2003, Clark began disaggregating information on student performance, in alignment with NCLB's accountability measures and focus on data to drive instruction. By looking at the data on student performance, Clark was able to identify subgroups of students that were not performing as well as the school average and implemented strategies detailed in its Title I School Improvement Plan to close the achievement gap. The data showed that the subgroups that needed more attention were their black students and students eligible for free and reduced-priced lunch. Clark faculty members worked diligently to address the educational needs of those students, and data from the 2006 SAT-10 and Alabama Reading and Mathematics Test (ARMT) showed the progress students had made; on those tests there was little difference between the scores of students in the "black" and "free and reduced-priced lunch" subgroups and students in any other subgroup. In some instances, students in the "free/reduced lunch" subgroup outperformed students in the "paid lunch" group and black students outperformed non-black students.  High-performing schools often share similar characteristics. For example, teachers work collaboratively; there are numerous opportunities for professional development; and data drives instruction and further assessment. All of these characteristics are present at Clark, where teachers use a hands-on approach to address the learning needs of all students. Most importantly, the school's faculty has high expectations, an approach that is paying off for teachers and students.  Teacher Knowledge Is Critical  Consistent with the Math Panel's recommendation that teachers must know in detail the mathematical content they are responsible for teaching and its connections to other important mathematics, Clark aims to increase its teachers' knowledge of math to positively influence student achievement. The district provides in-service training for teachers, and Clark's Math Chair Boren encourages her teachers to be active in professional organizations. Recently some teachers took an online course on differentiating learning strategies and used the strategies to help students use their strengths to master concepts. Clark also sends some teachers to conferences sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). Those teachers share what they learn with others at departmental meetings. Principal McWain explains that opportunities for professional development abound at Clark. "We are always on the cutting edge. We try to think outside the box. We incorporate this into the curriculum by giving students new techniques and strategies to succeed. The teachers work cooperatively together-including rewriting and enhancing the curriculum."  Clark aims to increase their students' knowledge with each grade level. A good example of early work with the foundations of algebra is apparent in fourth grade when students study fractions. The fourth grade goal is to expose students to equivalent fractions and basic operations with fractions of like denominators. Some of the activities in the classroom might include making fraction bars and grids, and the elementary teachers use different colors with the bars and grids to help students "see" the fractions.  In fifth grade classes, students use operations with like and unlike denominators. Teachers also expose students to canceling when multiplying fractions and putting fractions in lowest terms. Operations with mixed numbers also are introduced, and by the end of fifth grade, teachers expect students to be proficient with operations with fractions of like denominators and to be able to find equivalent fractions. The sixth graders are expected to master these skills, in addition to changing fractions to decimals and then changing decimals to percents. In the "core plus" curriculum, teachers begin the process of teaching students to work with positive and negative fractions and mixed numbers early. In the seventh grade, students aim to master these skills.  Typical classrooms use a hands-on approach to help students understand key concepts. All of the teachers use games with fractions and white boards in the classroom to encourage students to be proficient. Sixth grade math teacher Angela Rocker said that her students enjoy "Fraction Face-Off," in which a small group of students will be given a fraction problem and race to get the correct answer. The winner of the game will face a new group of challengers. Students use white boards to check for understanding. All of the students in the class are required to do a specific problem and hold up their answer on the boards. According to Boren, "This is a quick way to make sure that all students are focused and understand how to complete the problem. Our students enjoy using these boards!"  Parents also see the advantage of Clark's approach to math. As one parent remarked, "My daughter doesn't even realize she's learning math. They integrate it throughout all the subjects and it's important because we can use it at home in real situations, like sewing skirts for our theater group and determining the circumference of the waists without a pattern. They also have everything a parent needs for the tools to help their child and for the child to work and get whatever they want in life."  U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings announced a new pilot program under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) aimed at helping states differentiate between underperforming schools in need of dramatic interventions and those that are closer to meeting the goals of NCLB. As part of the new pilot program, states that meet the four eligibility criteria may propose a differentiated accountability model. These eligibility criteria are based on the "bright line" principles of NCLB. (March 18)  During testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor hearing on "Ensuring the Availability of Federal Student Loans," Secretary Margaret Spellings launched a new brochure, Federal Aid First, a resource for students and families that encourages them to maximize more affordable Federal student aid options before pursuing other options. To access the brochure and additional information about federal student aid, please visit  (March 14)  Education Secretary Spellings announced the release of the final report of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel, and the findings were passed unanimously at the panel's meeting at Longfellow Middle School in Falls Church, Va. The panel reviewed the best available scientific evidence to advance the teaching and learning of mathematics and stressed the importance of effort, algebra, and early math education. (March 13)  Secretary Spellings joined Intel Chairman Craig Barrett to honor Intel Science Talent Search (STS) finalists. STS is America's oldest and most prestigious high school science competition. The top prize this year went to Shivani Sud of Durham, N.C, who developed a model that analyzed the specific "molecular signatures" of tumors from patients with Stage II colon cancer. She used this information to identify patients at higher risk for tumor recurrence and propose potentially effective drugs for treatment. (March 13)  Following a visit to Van Duyn Elementary School in Syracuse, N.Y., where Secretary Spellings highlighted progress toward NCLB goals in New York and across the nation, she joined Representative Jim Walsh (R-NY) and school officials at an education roundtable to discuss the state's accountability plan, standards, and assessments. She also discussed the new tool recently released by the Department known as Mapping New York's Educational Progress 2008. (March 10)  Continuing the dialogue on NCLB and priorities for 2008, Secretary Spellings convened an education roundtable at the West Virginia State Capitol Building with Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), First Lady of West Virginia Gayle Manchin, West Virginia State Superintendent Steve Paine, and state education leaders and policymakers. She also visited Saint Albans High School in Saint Albans, W.V., and delivered remarks recognizing the progress of the school's students under NCLB. (March 7)  Secretary Spellings continued her national tour to discuss No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in North Carolina, where she addressed the North Carolina State Board of Education in Raleigh and discussed how the federal government can support and facilitate further academic gains made by the state's students under the law. She also participated in a roundtable with educators and school administrators. (March 5)  Secretary Spellings delivered remarks at the Reading First State Directors Conference and declared that with the help of the Reading First program, there have been dramatic gains in student and school achievement. She called on Congress to restore funding for the program to $1 billion, as requested in the President's fiscal year 2009 budget. (March 6)  The March edition of Education News Parents Can Use featured the work of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel and included a discussion about the Panel's final report and how its findings will lead to more effective math instruction in classrooms nationwide. The show also spotlighted what the Department and other key partners are doing to promote math and science literacy through the American Competitiveness Initiative and showcased the work of high-performing schools around the country that are excelling in math education and effectively implementing the Panel's recommendations.

From the Office of Innovation and Improvement  The Full Service Community Schools (FSCS) Program is recruiting peer reviewers for its upcoming grant competition. This program encourages coordination of educational, developmental, family, health, and other services through partnerships between public elementary and secondary schools and community-based organizations and public or private entities. Grants are intended to provide comprehensive educational, social, and health services for students, families, and communities. To obtain additional information or to submit resumes, contact the program at FSCS@ed.gov, using the subject "Reviewer Information."  American History  Students at Henry E. Lackey High School in southern Maryland have developed one of the most comprehensive oral history projects of black life in the region. Students interviewed several of the region's oldest black residents and are creating an hour-long DVD that will be aired during Charles County's 350th anniversary celebration this summer. The project is one of several recent efforts to expand students' knowledge about the black population in Maryland's oldest counties. (March 6)  Elizabeth R. Varon, distinguished lecturer with the Organization of American Historians (OAH), writes in the OAH Newsletter about her experience visiting teachers who participate in the OII-funded Teaching American History (TAH) Program in Rockford, Ill. She notes, "The first thing that struck me was the dedication of the 60 or so teachers who were willing to give up their Saturdays… for a day of intensive collaboration." The Rockford Public School system is in its last year of a fiscal year 2004 TAH grant. (February 2008)  Arts Education  March is Arts in the Schools Month, and to bring attention to the importance of the arts in K-12, the American Association of School Administrators is putting the arts at "center stage" in its March edition of The School Administrator. Among the journal edition's features available to online readers are perspectives on the role of the arts in fostering innovation and the acquisition of skills needed in a knowledge-based economy, stories of schools and districts keeping the arts strong as part of leaving no child behind, and suggestions for policy leaders about the complete curriculum. (March 2008)  The Art of Collaboration: Promising Practices for Integrating the Arts and School ReformPDF (1.53 MB) is a new research and policy brief from the Arts Education Partnership. The brief describes promising practices for building community partnerships that integrate the arts into urban education systems. The publication resulted from a roundtable discussion among the directors of eight demonstration sites that are participating in The Ford Foundation's Integrating the Arts and Education Reform Initiative. (March 24)  Findings from studies by neuroscientists and psychologists at seven universities are helping scientists understand how arts instruction might improve general thinking skills. Learning, Arts, and the Brain, a Dana Consortium report on arts and cognition, does not provide definitive answers to the "arts-makes-you-smarter" question, but it does dispute the theory that students are either right- or left-brained learners. It also offers hints on how arts learning might relate to learning in other academic disciplines. (March 2008)  Charter Schools  Synergy Charter Academy in South Los Angeles was named Charter School of the Year at this year's California Charter School Conference. Caprice Young, former president of the Los Angeles Unified School Board who is now chief executive of the California Charter Schools Association, said, "[Synergy Charter] should be credited with not only closing the achievement gap, but eliminating it." The school was the highest-performing school in South Los Angeles in 2006 and 2007, and was named a National Charter School of the Year last year by the Center for Education Reform. (March 3)  Students in South Carolina might be interested in a new virtual charter school that will open this fall. South Carolina Connections Academy will be the state's first virtual charter school, and will enroll 500 students in its online K-12 program. Connections Academy, a company that runs schools enrolling 10,000 students in 14 other states, will manage the new school. (March 3)  The Center for Education Reform (CER), a Washington-based education reform advocacy group, recently ranked each state based on the strength of its charter school laws and found significant differences among the states. For example, Minnesota had the strongest charter laws in the country, while Mississippi had the weakest. Each state received a letter grade, "A" through "F," based on criteria developed by CER. (Feb. 13)  As charter schools across the nation gear up for lotteries, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools is offering a free PDF (168 KB) "Charter School Lottery Day Tool Kit." Lottery days can present opportunities to: draw media attention to the demand for quality charters; create awareness among families of school choice, and create an opportunity for charters to communicate their success. Charter school staff can use the tool kit to create their own lottery day event. Materials on preparation, messaging, recruitment, media outreach, timelines, and costs are included. (February 2008)  Closing the Achievement Gap  Each year since the 2005 National Education Summit and the founding of the American Diploma Project (ADP) Network, Achieve has issued an annual report based on a 50-state survey of efforts to close the "expectations gap" between high school requirements and the demands of colleges and employers. Closing the Expectations Gap 2008 reveals that while a majority of states have made closing the expectations gap a priority, some states have moved much more aggressively than others. (February 2008)  Education Reform  Publicschoolinsights.org is a new online resource aimed at building a sense of community among individuals who are working at the local level to strengthen their public schools. The site also features a variety of success stories from U.S. schools and districts that have adopted effective strategies for addressing key challenges in education. (March 2008)  Mathematics and Science  Nearly three out of five U.S. teens (59 percent) do not believe their high school is preparing them adequately for careers in technology or engineering, according to the 2008 Lemelson-MIT Invention Index, an annual survey that gauges Americans' attitudes toward invention and innovation. The good news is that 72 percent believe technological inventions or innovations can solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as global warming and water pollution. Sixty-four percent of those surveyed are confident that they could invent the solutions. (Jan. 16)  Raising Student Achievement  Fifty-nine exemplary middle schools across the country have been named "Schools to Watch" as part of a recognition program developed by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. Each school was selected by state leaders for its academic excellence, responsiveness to the needs and interests of young learners, and commitment to helping all students achieve to high levels. In addition, each school has made a commitment to assessment and accountability to bring about continuous improvement, teachers who work collaboratively, and strong leadership. (March 14)  A nonprofit organization has launched a national campaign called "Ready by 21" that will work to help youth become better prepared for college, work, and life. Run by the Forum for Youth Investment, the initiative is intended to help state and local leaders improve education and social services during the first two decades of children's lives. The initiative urges leaders to work together on interrelated problems such as drug use, teenage pregnancy, and school dropouts. (March 2008)  Legislation under consideration in Maryland and many other states is intended to ease the transition for students whose parents serve in the military. These students change schools an average of six to nine times between kindergarten and 12th grade. A proposed PDF (341 KB) multi-state compact supported by the Pentagon is intended to reduce the complications involved with these school transfers. (March 2008)  California students who fail to earn a high school diploma before they turn 20 years old cost the state $46.4 billion over the course of their lives. Each year, about 120,000 students in the state drop out. The high cost associated with these dropouts is related to greater rates of unemployment, crime, and dependence upon welfare and state-funded medical care, as well as lost tax-revenues, according to a report from the California Dropout Research Project. (February 2008)  Teacher Quality and Development  Attrition would be lessened if schools offered new teachers more support and guidance, according to an Alliance for Excellent Education PDF (93.9 KB) issue brief. The report found that teachers who graduated from very selective colleges, or who had high SAT scores, were more likely to leave the teaching profession before retirement or transfer to higher-performing schools. (February 2008)  Charter Schools A mayoral change in Indianapolis, the only city nationwide in which the mayor's office authorizes charter schools, has not changed support for that city's 17 charter schools. The new mayor, Greg Ballard, voiced strong support for the charter movement created by his predecessor, Bart Peterson, at a recent conference of charter school leaders. The charter schools, according to Mayor Ballard, are in no danger, and they offer an important choice for parents and a way to improve education in the city. [More—Indianapolis Star] (Feb. 22)  The proposition that teacher quality is a more important variable than class size and other factors will be put to the test next school year, when the Equity Project, a new charter middle school in New York City, is slated to open. Its creator and first principal, Zeke Vanderhoek, plans to pay the school's expected teachers $125,000 annually, plus potential bonuses based on school-wide achievement. Because that is nearly twice as much as the average teacher in the city earns, the experiment will no doubt garner more than just local attention. For their high salaries, Equity Project teachers will work a longer day and year and will accept some duties that fall to administrators in other schools. [More—The New York Times] (March 7) (free registration required)  Mathematics and Science Two members of the USA Today's 2007 All-USA Teacher Team find ways to inspire their high school students in economics and mathematics. An economics teacher at the California Academy of Math and Science, where many students are the children of Asian or Hispanic immigrants, taps into students' creativity. The teacher uses techniques such as student playwriting to illustrate economic principles to semester-long assignments in which students develop a proposed start-up company. In College Park, Ga., at Benjamin Banneker High School, 63 percent of students are eligible for free- or reduced-priced meals, and many students already have children of their own or wear ankle bracelets that allow law enforcement officials to monitor their movements. It is at this school that one teacher has inspired his students to learn advanced mathematics and use education as a tool to improve their lives. The school's pass rate on the state graduation exam has jumped from 85 percent to 95 percent between 2005 and 2006.

For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) is a catalyst for both public and private investments in science and technology programs in high schools, not only in Minneapolis, but across the state of Minnesota. Driving the investment among such private-sector contributors as Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and the 3M Foundation is a desire to encourage future engineers. The Minnesota Department of Education has increased its funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) initiatives statewide as well, providing more than $4 million to school districts between 2006 and 2008.

College Board spokesperson Jennifer Topiel, while noting that test scores often decline with increases in the number of test takers, observed, "Students should not be placed into AP classes without better preparation." The analysis also revealed a widening gap over the past four years between black and white students earning at least a three on the exams.

This belief is based on a national study of students' reading and mathematics test scores and the students' degree of involvement in physical education between kindergarten and fifth grade. According to the CDC researchers, the connection was most notable for girls receiving the highest levels of physical education (more than 70 minutes per week), who scored consistently higher on the tests than those who received less than 35 minutes a week in physical education.

__label__0 Editorial Reviews  As far as math goes, McKellar knows her stuff. With two girlcentric, best-selling titles under her belt (Math Doesn't Suck, 2008, and Kiss My Math, 2009) and a degree in mathematics from UCLA, it is almost easy to forget that she was Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years. Facing down a 432-page book devoted to algebra could give even math whizzes pause, but McKellar makes it work, taking the textbook-meets-Seventeen approach by mixing the explanations and equations with boy talk, quizzes, and testimonials from successful women. While a tutor might use this title as a teaching aid, teen girls will want to explore it on their own. Navigation is easy; students are encouraged to hop from chapter to chapter as their homework demands. The breakdown of equations is effective and certainly unconventional—explaining functions in terms of sausage factories, for example, or exponents in terms of whip-bearing female executives (makes sense in the book, promise)—and while McKellar keeps her focus on how to solve math problems, her approach is both readable and even entertaining. --Courtney Jones  About the Author  BestMore About the Author  Best known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from UCLA, went on to co-write a published math theorem, and continues to be an outspoken role model for young women to excel in math.  McKellar's 3rd and latest math book encourages teenage girls to outclass the boys in algebra. This can be an especially tough subject and she tackles it in a way that invites the outlandish idea of actually enjoying math.  She rejects the notion that excelling in algebra is all about natural gift. Rather, it's about determination and making an effort.  While the sex-appeal of the book might be in question, ultimately this is a book broken down into straightforward language, easy charts and memorable reminders of the process of algebra.  Additionally, you'll find motivating stories from youthful female adults who've struggled with math, but learned to conquer their struggles. Danica proclaims. "I'm here to tell you that giving up on ourselves because of our own stereotypes and limited imaginations is a far more destructive force than any challenge or obstacle 'out there,'"  One bonus in the book is the inclusion of good tables and charts. These can be worth the price of the book alone. These succinctly explain the meaning of math terms such as fractions, coefficients and variables.  A surprising aspect of the book is the authors inclusion of advice on how to choose the right guys to date. While she doesn't provide a mathematic formula for this it does seem she dispenses some basic common sense.  What a great book to help tutor teen girls in math! It is organized well, so it is easy to navigate and you don't have to read it straight through. You can pick your topic and go back and forth with ease. The author is obviously a great teacher and knows her stuff. She combines that with her ability to reach out and grab the attention of teen girls and make math fun. A must have to share with the girls in your life!  At last, a book that teaches middle-school students and their parents in simple terms how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square and to solve the quadratic equation in standard form in X (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) to come up with the quadratic forumla. Most colleges and high schools do not teach this -- they just expect the student to know it.  The charter school I support plans to use Hot X: Algebra Exposed in concert with the first two books to ensure most or all Grade 8 students attain an A (93 or higher) in Algebra I.  Danica McKellar needs to continue writing math books. Since these are such outstanding books, few state departments of education will adopt them for use, which means parents, other major care givers, and supportive businesses will have to come up with the funds to help schools with the purchase of these books. Not only should the schools have these books for use as textbooks, but individual students should have their own copy to help learn the material initially and to refresh key points as they complete Algebra II and beyond.  Danica also has web sites that provide additional information for each book. Check out [...]. If you wish to provide input to Danica, you may send it to her at: share@danicamckellar.com.

__label__0 Just the math skills you need to excel in the study or practice of engineering  Good math skills are indispensable for all engineers regardless of their specialty, yet only a relatively small portion of the math that engineering students study in college mathematics courses is used on a frequent basis in the study or practice of engineering. That's why Essential Math Skills for Engineers focuses on only these few critically essential math skills that students need in order to advance in their engineering studies and excel in engineering practice.  Essential Math Skills for Engineers features concise, easy-to-follow explanations that quickly bring readers up to speed on all the essential core math skills used in the daily study and practice of engineering. These fundamental and essential skills are logically grouped into categories that make them easy to learn while also promoting their long-term retention. Among the key areas covered are:  With the thorough understanding of essential math skills gained from this text, readers will have mastered a key component of the knowledge needed to become successful students of engineering. In addition, this text is highly recommended for practicing engineers who want to refresh their math skills in order to tackle problems in engineering with confidence.
__label__0 So I was having a lot of medical issues my freshman year, and I pulled a C+ in second quarter calculus and a C- in third quarter calculus (integration and multivariable calculus, respectively.) I still have one more quarter of calculus entitled "Vector analysis." I'm wondering if my poor performance (and poor understanding of the material) is going to negatively affect me later on. Will I have a chance to relearn some of the material in my other classes, or should I self study to get myself up to par? Just so you know, as of right now I'm leaning towards a Mechanical Engineering major, but I may switch into Civil (though highly unlikely.) This upcoming quarter I'm taking Vector Analysis, first quarter Calculus-based Physics, and a MATLAB course (I have absolutely zero programming experience.) Physics and MATLAB both require integral calculus as a prerequisite. I need a B in physics to switch into MechE. Should I be self studying the calculus that I don't quite understand?  Also, will these grades kill my chances of getting into grad school? They're my only grades below a B, and I hopefully won't have many (any?) more C's in my college career.  To understand the computational part of engineering you need to understand differential equations, which is where you use the calculus skills. You then use DEs to describe all kinds of physical phenomena. So, the basic calculus skills are very important to understanding engineering.  Thanks HPuck. So would it suffice to get down integration and partial derivatives and their applications? Or should I learn other things like Taylor Polynomials and Convergence/Divergence (the stuff that tripped me up most)?  Calculus is one of the few subjects you really need to put in the effort to learn well. Study all of it until you have a strong conceptual understanding of it. Bad grades are bad grades, but calculus is important.  Calculus will be used in physics. Multivariable calculus will become important when you take the physics course with electricity and magnetism. Differential equations will become important in many places.  Try and improve on basic integration/misc techniques (integration by parts, partial fraction decomp, trig int, partial derivations, etc) because these will be very important in DE. A lot of questions will have a lot of nested integrals/nasty integrals and you don't want to get stuck in the middle of the question. Freshen up on Taylor and Maclaurin series. When you take linear alg practice matrix techniques, translation matrices, etc. (will be used in systems of differential equations)There are only two subjects you absolutely have to know, without constantly consulting a reference: calculus and physics. Yeah, it will come back to haunt you if you don't put in the effort to get the hang of it. Get on that, no matter how much work it takes.1 year left of Engineering school. Taylor series rarely comes into play. The only time it did show up, it was just mentioned as part of the proof and we didn't have to do anything with it. But yes, calculus is EXTREMELY important, if not for the pure concept of what it means to take the integral/derivative. Also, so so many people don't have a good grasp on all the material that came before calculus too, especially trig. Know your trig, it will help you out, a lot.

__label__0 Specification  Aims  The unit aims to introduce the basic ideas of differentiable manifolds.  Brief Description of the unit  Differentiable manifolds are among the most fundamental notions of modern mathematics. Roughly, they are geometrical objects that can be endowed with coordinates; using these coordinates one can apply differential and integral calculus, but the results are coordinate-independent.  Examples of manifolds start with open domains in Euclidean space R^n , and include "multidimensional surfaces" such as the n-sphere S^n and n-torus T^n , the projective spaces RP^n and CP^n , and their generalizations, matrix groups such as the rotation group SO(n), etc. Differentiable manifolds naturally appear in various applications, e.g., as configuration spaces in mechanics. They are arguably the most general objects on which calculus can be developed. On the other hand, differentiable manifolds provide for calculus a powerful invariant geometric language, which is used in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications.  In this course we give an introduction to the theory of manifolds, including their definition and examples; vector fields and differential forms; integration on manifolds and de Rham cohomology.  Learning Outcomes  On completion of this unit successful students will be able to:  deal with various examples of differentiable manifolds and smooth maps;  have familiarity with tangent vectors, tensors and differential forms;  work practically with vector fields and differential forms;  appreciate the basic ideas of de Rham cohomology and its examples;  apply the ideas of differentiable manifolds to other areas.  Future topics requiring this course unit  Differentiable manifolds are used in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications, including physics and engineering. The following course units are specifically based on MATH31061/MATH41061 Differentiable Manifolds: MATH41122 Differential Geometry; MATH41101 Geometric Cobordism Theory  Syllabus  Manifolds and smooth maps. Coordinates on familiar spaces. Charts and atlases. Definitions of manifolds and smooth maps. Products. Specifying manifolds by equations. More examples of manifolds.  Integration. Orientation. Integral over a compact oriented manifold. Independence of atlas and partition of unity. Integration over singular manifolds and chains. Stokes theorem.  De Rham cohomology. Definition of cohomology and examples of nonzero classes. Poincaré Lemma. Examples of calculation.  Textbooks  No particular textbook is followed. Students are advised to keep their own lecture notes. There are many good sources available treating various aspects of differentiable manifolds on various levels and from different viewpoints. Below is a list of texts that may be useful. More can be found by searching library shelves.

__label__0 will provide activists with self-standing lessons and online support so they can apply and share mathematical thinking to address globalization and its consequences, notably climate change.  We will create a set of 30 self-standing math lessons for self-learners . Each lesson will present a classic math problem and a deep idea which it illustrates. We will organize an online support center for tutoring and consulting, but especially for supporting "math in action" for analysis and communication of challenges and solutions in our changing world, focusing on climate change. We will publish a paperback, worksheets, a wiki and YouTube videos, all in the Public Domain.  Our age of globalization is propagating rapid changes and dramatic instabilities. Will we match this with an ability to think and talk and act decisively and independently? We need to appreciate the connection between our local choices and the global picture. Mathematics is a language for talking about the subtle but profound distinctions of the models that may be at play. It helps us care about each other's situation around the world. We're all potential climate refugees. Math help us learn to share with each other. It helps us exchange our wisdom as climate patterns shift and disrupt our agriculture, our water supply, our built environment. We need to think deeply and learn rapidly. We need ideas and problems that are to the point and can be spread freely. We need math lessons on-demand!  Andrius Kulikauskas is since childhood a lifelong learner on a quest to know everything and apply that knowledge usefully. At the University of California at San Diego, he studied mathematics as a tool for conceptual thinking. He was appointed senior teaching assistant, responsible for training the first year teaching assistants. He earned his Ph.D. in 1993 for this thesis "Symmetric Functions of the Eigenvalues of a Matrix".  Andrius taught a Precalculus class at UCSD for students who were ill prepared for Calculus. He knew the dismal state of mathematics teaching. High school teachers generally don't think mathematically. Truly, mathematics should be a tool for thinking, where the point is first to understand the relevance of various models, and only then to calculate. Unfortunately, textbooks are full of contrived, irrelevant problems which hinder mathematical intuition. Andrius taught from his own notes:  He identified the key ideas leading up to Calculus, and surveyed them all in thirty one-hour lessons. His students did very well!  In 2008, Andrius taught algebra as a Professor at American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He taught 90 business students, many of whom were unmotivated because they thought math was irrelevant, and yet they rated him an outstanding teacher. He concentrated on teaching them a few dozen classic problems which were difficult but insightful. For example, suppose that the price of a barrel of oil goes up by one-third this week, but then goes down by one-third next week. What is the overall change in price? Many people suppose that the two changes cancel out and the price is the same. But actually, if the barrel of oil costs $90, then it goes up to $120, but down to $80! And, in general, it goes up from X to 4/3 X and then down to 8/9 X. This is a very thoughtful problem and it illustrates a very deep idea, which is that algebra is the study of thinking step-by-step. If you don't think step-by-step, you can't solve this problem, because you won't know what "one-third" means. Most books and teachers don't and can't teach step-by-step thinking because it's a lot of work to grade. But if the problem is truly relevant, then the effort is worth it!  Here are some of Andrius's favorite problems:  * The world's population is doubling every thirty years. Suppose that was always true. When was Adam created? and Eve? It may be shocking to learn that they appeared only 1,000 years ago! This shows the power of exponential growth, but especially, is a great illustration of how a model (and perhaps every model) breaks down at a certain point. * What is 10 + 4? The answer is 2! At least the clock says it is! Ten o'clock plus four o'clock is two o'clock. This problem shows that there is more than one mathematical system, but also suggests that we can't write down everything we need to know about a system. * All parabolas have the same shape! Some may look skinny and others fat. Yet by zooming in and out, flipping them upside down, moving left or right or up or down, we can see that they have the same shape. This teaches us the basics of transforming any graph. * "A right triangle is half a rectangle". Thus the shape of a right triangle is given by the ratio of the two sides of the rectangle. But you also know the shape if you know one of the right triangle's acute angles. We can switch back and forth between these two ways of looking at the shape. This "bijection" is the basis for trigonometry! * "Four times a right triangle is the difference of two squares." This geometric fact makes for a quick proof of the Pythagorean theorem, but also shows the theorem's relevance for switching coordinate systems, which is to say, points of view.  Imagine if all of math education was organized around such classic problems. Andrius will write an essay for every such problem to show why and how it's interesting for a mathematician and philosopher. Each lesson can include many variants of the problem along with applications and exercises. A few dozen problems are enough to survey all of algebra. They could fit in a paperback of 150 pages or so.  Such a paperback would allow parents to master the mathematics which they'd like to help their children learn. After reading such a paperback, they would feel confident taming the monstrous 500 page textbooks used at school.  Imagine if people could use such materials without restriction! Ours will be in the Public Domain so they might be shared, adapted and improved! A teacher in Africa might print out one lesson at a time, think up a game that teaches the concept, and then write a letter how it went. People could share examples and applications from around the world!  Indeed, we can set up a wiki to collect classic problems, ideas and examples in math and other subjects. A wiki is an online tool with which individual problems could be easily edited and linked together into a pattern language, as in Christopher Alexander's "A Timeless Way of Building". Yet each lesson can also stand on its own.  We're living in a world with many new issues linking people of very different cultures. We need to be able to understand subtle but profound implications of our decisions. Activists need math to analyze and communicate the choices we have. We can support them online with a chat room and related venues. We can help them find the right lesson to apply to their challenge and to teach the public and the powers-that-be. They can present their lesson with a short video of "math in action".  We have many opportunities to apply math in our world. We can develop math intuition based on real problems, not contrived exercises. We can organize an online community to create learning materials in the Public Domain that encourage self-learners to understand mathematics in terms of its deep ideas and practical applications. As we face global challenges, including our current economic crisis, we find social and business opportunity in recognizing what is truly worth learning, and making that available for all to share freely. We offer a Baltic and Nordic team to start up this activist approach to education.  Andrius will start by identifying noteworthy math problems from his own notes, from websites, from discussion groups, from colleagues online and from mathematics textbooks, especially intuitive books such as "Applying Arithmetic: A Handbook of Applications of Arithmetic" by Zalman Usiskin and Max Bell and "How to Lie with Statistics" by Darrell Huff. He will continuously look for new problems and invite others to contribute them. He will relate each problem with a deep idea that it illustrates. He will select what he thinks are the thirty or so pairs of problems and ideas which most completely and profoundly present mathematics. He will write an essay for each problem/idea.  Andrius will also create a general format for writing up each problem, idea and related examples, illustrations, applications and exercises. He will adapt the wiki at worknets.org with templates and navigation which accomodate the contributing, polishing and organizing of these problems for self-learners.  Early in our project, Andrius will travel to Tampere, Finland to work for one month with filmmaker Teemu Takatalo at the Hirvitalo community centre. Andrius will work with activists to understand what math ideas might be relevant for their campaigns. Teemu will coach them on using video to communicate these ideas.  Andrius will also travel to Latvia to work with open source publisher Didzis Veinbergs. Didzis will find one or more designers and/or illustrators to help with designing the website and illustrating the mathematical ideas. They will also provide images for our video makers in Finland.  Mihkel Pilv and Miksike will find adults who are interested in learning mathematics, perhaps in order to help their children learn. Andrius will visit them in Estonia for one month and tutor them. He will also organize online tutoring at  by chat, email and Skype to help them and others around the world.  Midway into our project, Andrius will start publishing individual lessons online. Miksike's adult learners will test the lessons and help create related worksheets. Andrius will return to work with them.  As the videos are completed, they will be published online and also made available through our wiki. Didzis Veinbergs will promote them and the activist's campaigns along with the upcoming book. Andrius Kulikauskas will visit him in Latvia and they will publish and promote a short paperback of "Classic Math Problems".  We will adapt the book and translate it from English into Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian and publish and promote electronic versions.  All of the materials created for our project will belong to the Public Domain.  Description of partnership("who does what")  Our project includes four partners from Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Finland.  Minciu Sodas is the coordinator for our project. It is a sole proprietorship registered in Vilnius, Lithuania. Andrius Kulikauskas is the founder, sole proprietor and Direktorius. Minciu Sodas is an online laboratory for serving and organizing independent thinkers around the world. We have about 150 active and 1,500 supportive participants. Our most spectacular project so far was the Pyramid of Peace  in 2008 in Kenya. We organized 100 peacemakers on-the-ground and 100 online assistants to avert genocide during the post-election turmoil. We used our wiki, mailing lists and chat room, all in the Public Domain, to coordinate our work.  Andrius Kulikauskas will select the problems and ideas, author the essays, the lessons and the paperback, and code the wiki and help room. This work is the heart of this project. He will be supported by Minciu Sodas's team of online assistants who will collect interesting examples and tutor self-learners.  Miksike is a pioneer in educational crowdsourcing.  More than 1,000 volunteers have created 30,000 worksheets used by 120,000 students, see: lefo.net Miksike is a Private Limited Company based in Estonia. Mihkel Pilv is the director. He is an innovative entrepreneur, ever discovering new business opportunity. Mihkel and Andrius met on a flight to the MIT Media Lab ThinkCycle's Development by Design 2002 conference in Bangalore, India to which they both won travel awards for their papers about their work.  Pispalan kulttuuriyhdistys ry (Pispala Cultural Association) runs the Hirvitalo center of contemporary art in Tampere, Finland. Hirvitalo is a base for artistic and cultural activists, including gardens and permaculture. Markus Petz is now the European Voluntary Service coordinator there. He first met Andrius on a road trip they took together to visit UK independent thinkers. Markus organized a video bridge from Hirvitalo in 2008 with Andrius about his paper "An Economy for Giving Everything Away".  Pispala Cultural Association will organize ten activists addressing the consequences of globalization, especially climate change. Each activist will create a YouTube video illustrating "math in action" in their campaigns. Teemu Takatalo will coach them in video skills.  Ūdenszīmes (Signs of Water) is an NGO from Jēkabpils, Latvia, that is working towards improving the possibilities of education for children and young people in Latvia, thus helping create an educated, ethical and responsible society. It was founded in 2007, and its founding members have been active in other NGOs since 1997. Ūdenszīmes will host Didzis Veinbergs's work to publish our Classic Math Problems as a paperback in the Public Domain. Didzis and Andrius met in 2008 at BarCamp Baltics. Andrius invited Didzis to Vilnius for the workshop "Ethical Public Domain: Debate of Questionable Practices" which Minciu Sodas organized for COMMUNIA, the European Union's thematic network for the Public Domain. Didzis spoke there about his plan to publish books with free licences. Didzis will publish, promote and distribute Andrius's book as well as provide designers and/or illustrators for related websites.  Minciu Sodas will translate the book into Lithuanian, Ūdenszīmes into Latvian and Miksike into Estonian.  Of our total budget of 82,000 EUR, which includes our co-financing and our administrative fee, we ask for 60,000 EUR of which 30,000 EUR is for Minciu Sodas, 10,000 EUR for Miksike, 10,000 EUR for Pispala Cultural Association and 10,000 EUR for Ūdenszīmes.  Each of the partners will contribute co-financing in terms of the work of their many volunteers who will collect examples and staff our help room and translate into Lithuanian (Minciu Sodas), try out our lessons and create worksheets (Miksike), apply our math lessons to climate change and other global challenges (Pispala Cultural Association) and promote and distribute our book (Ūdenszīmes).  Expected outcome(Please describe the expected results of your project, who will be effected and how, directly and/or indirectly)  Our project will result in a wealth of learning materials in the Public Domain.  We will publish a short, readable, popular book "Classic Math Problems" with essays on about 30 math problems and the deep ideas they illustrate, along with applications and exercises, and an introduction that weaves them all together. There is a chance that our book will become a classic. "How to Lie With Statistics" was first published in 1954 and today ranks in the top 7,000 books at Amazon.com  We will organize a thriving where such problems are suggested and polished by completing a template for them. Our wiki will link together the problems by various threads. We will establish a new paradigm for creating learning materials.  We will also include links to 10 videos that show our "math in action". We will have helped 10 activists use math to make their case to the public and relevant institutions. We aim for at least one of them to achieve a success that affects or inspires at least 100,000 people.  We will jumpstart an online help room  In our first year we will personally help more than 100 people develop their mathematical thinking.  We will create worksheets for use through Miksike and other venues. In particular, we will create one-page worksheets, each dedicated to one lesson, so that a teacher can print them out on-demand when they prepare for their class.  We will publish CDs and/or USB flash drives with all of the above materials for use in remote areas such as Africa with computers such as the One Laptop Per Child XO.  Our materials will be primarily in English, but also some lessons and worksheets in Estonian and possibly other languages.  All of the content which we create for this project will be in the Public Domain.  We will have a team of enthusiasts in the Nordic and Baltic countries and around the world interested in further developing learning materials for mathematics but also other subjects.  Dissemination of results(Please focus on sharing the results with individuals, organisations or groups who are not your partners this project)  We will have electronic versions of the book and associated learning materials in English, Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian.  We will print at least 1500 copies of the English version of our book. We will sell at least 1,000 copies in stores in the Nordic and Baltic countries and also by mail.  We will distribute our printed book to at least 500 people around the world who will help promote the printed and/or online versions, bring attention to them and open up business opportunity. We're especially interested in parents, especially homeschoolers, who would like to learn math better so they could teach their children, and also activists who might benefit from applying mathematics and thereby raise public interest in our classic math problems. We expect at least 7,000 people to read or hear lessons from the printed book and that a second printing be profitable.  In the first year that the book is available, we expect at least 10,000 people in the Nordic and Baltic region to download the electronic book in English, Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian. We expect 100,000 people around the world to download the English version and another 100,000 people to learn from it through the One Laptop Per Child program with which we have links through Edward Cherlin's Earth Treasury, a working group of Minciu Sodas.  We hope to attract media attention to our activists's campaigns in Finland and encourage other activists in the Nordic and Baltic countries to make use of our math lessons.  In Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and other Mikiske Learning Folder countries, we would like our math lessons to be a key resource for Miksike's large community of teachers and students.  We expect that Earth Treasury initiative  will organize the creation of open source educational software and animations based on lessons in our book.  We expect our wiki to be a growing repository of math lessons and our chat room helproom.org to be the center of lively tutoring and consulting services, for free and for pay, in math and other areas.  Minciu Sodas has many contacts in Africa. We're very excited that they might use and share our math learning materials.  In all of our efforts, our materials will spread more easily and widely because they are in the Public Domain for all to freely share, adapt and improve.  How will you evaluate that your project has met its objectives  We evaluate our project in terms of the relationships which we create, especially the people we include.  We expect, at the end of our project, to have a thriving wiki system with a well structured template, a core team of contributors and a growing collection of lessons and applications in math but also other fields.  We wish to find an eager market for our book so that we can fund a second printing of our own resources. We will note any interest that our book be translated, republished by others, and printed on-demand.  We will be excited to see individual lessons being copied and circulated. We will note the most popular sites for getting our book and note the download statistics.  We will be delighted if our materials are used by teachers and there are students learning math without standard textbooks, but especially in poor countries, such as in Africa.  We would like to see one or more of our lessons receive attention in the press thanks to its significance for some activist campaign. We would like one or more of our videos to be popular at YouTube. We will make up for each lesson a "tag" (like "halfrectangle") which can be used on YouTube, Flickr and other sites to note the uses of our classic math problems that all are encouraged to share. We would be excited to see people using such a tag system.  We plan for an active online help room with regular tutoring activity and potential business opportunity.  We wish to encourage a growing number of people that math's deep ideas and classic problems are truly relevant for thinkers and activists, especially for global issues such as climate change. We will know that we are having an impact on globalization and climate change if our lessons are adapted locally.

__label__0 Algebra I  COURSE DESCRIPTION  Algebra I is one of the most critical courses that students take in high school. Not only does it introduce them to a powerful reasoning tool with applications in many different careers, but algebra is the gateway to higher education. Students who do well in algebra are  better prepared for college entrance exams and for college in general, since algebra teaches them how to solve problems and think abstractly—skills that pay off no matter what major they pursue.  Because algebra involves a new way of thinking, many students find it especially challenging. Many parents also find it to be the area where they have the most trouble helping their high-school-age children. With 36 half-hour lessons, Algebra I is an entirely new course developed to meet both these concerns, teaching students and parents the concepts and procedures of first-year algebra in an easily accessible way. Indeed, anyone wanting to learn algebra from the beginning or needing a thorough review will find this course an ideal tutor.  Conquer the Challenges of Learning Algebra  Taught by Professor James A. Sellers, an award-winning educator at The Pennsylvania State University, Algebra I incorporates the following valuable features:  Drawing on extensive research, The Great Courses and Dr. Sellers have identified the biggest challenges for high school students in mastering Algebra I, which are specifically addressed in this course.  This course reflects the latest standards and emphases in high school and college algebra taught in the United States.  Algebra I includes a mini-textbook with detailed summaries of each lesson, a multitude of additional problems to supplement those presented in the on-screen lessons, guided instructions for solving the problems, and important formulas and definitions of terms.  Professor Sellers interacts with viewers in a one-on-one manner, carefully explaining every step in the solution to a problem and giving frequent tips, problem-solving strategies, and insights into areas where students have the most trouble.  As Director of Undergraduate Mathematics at Penn State, Professor Sellers appreciates the key role that algebra plays in preparing students for higher education. He understands what entering college students need to have mastered in terms of math preparation to launch themselves successfully on their undergraduate careers, whether they intend to take more math in college or not. Professor Sellers is alert to the math deficiencies of the typical entering high school graduate, and he has developed an effective strategy for putting students confidently on the road to college-level mathematics.  Whatever your age, it is well worth the trouble to master this subject. Algebra is indispensible for those embarking on careers in science, engineering, information technology, and higher mathematics, but it is also a fundamental reasoning tool that shows up in economics, architecture, publishing, graphic arts, public policy, manufacturing, insurance, and many other fields, as well as in a host of at-home activities such as planning a budget, altering a recipe, calculating car mileage, painting a room, planting a garden, building a patio, or comparison shopping.  And for all of its reputation as a grueling rite of passage, algebra is actually an enjoyable and fascinating subject—when taught well.  Algebra without Fear  Professor Sellers takes the fear out of learning algebra by approaching it in a friendly and reassuring spirit. Most students won't have a teacher as unhurried and as attentive to detail as Dr. Sellers, who explains everything clearly and, whenever possible, in more than one way so that the most important concepts sink in.  He starts with a review of fractions, decimals, percents, positive and negative numbers, and numbers raised to various powers, showing how to perform different operations on these values. Then he introduces variables as the building blocks of algebraic expressions, before moving on to the main ideas, terms, techniques, pitfalls, formulas, and strategies for success in tackling Algebra I. Throughout, he presents a carefully crafted series of gradually more challenging problems, building the student's confidence and mastery.  After taking this course, students will be familiar with the terminology and symbolic nature of first-year algebra and will understand how to represent various types of functions (linear, quadratic, rational, and radical) using algebraic rules, tables of data, and graphs. In the process, they will also become acquainted with the types of problems that can be solved using such functions, with a particular eye toward solving various types of equations and inequalities.  Throughout the course, Professor Sellers emphasizes the following skills:  Using multiple techniques to solve problems  Understanding when a given technique can be used  Knowing how to translate word problems into mathematical expressions  Recognizing numerical patterns  Tips for Success  Algebra is a rich and complex subject, in which seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome, often with ease, if one knows how to approach them. Professor Sellers is an experienced guide in this terrain and a treasure trove of practical advice—from the simple (make sure that you master the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to the more demanding (memorize the algebraic formulas that you use most often). Here are some other examples of his tips for success:  Learn the order of operations: These are the rules you follow when performing mathematical operations. You can remember the order with this sentence: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. The first letter of each word stands for an operation. First, do all work in parentheses; then the exponents; then multiplication and division; finally, do the addition and subtraction.  Know your variables: It's easy to make a mistake when writing an algebraic expression if you don't understand what each variable represents. Choose letters that you can remember; for example, d for distance and t for time. If you have sloppy handwriting, avoid letters that look like numbers (b, l, o, s, and z).  Use graph paper: You'll be surprised at how the grid of lines encourages you to organize your thinking. The columns and rows help you keep your work neat and easy to follow.  Pay attention to signs: Be very careful of positive and negative signs. A misplaced plus or minus sign will give you the wrong answer.  Don't mix units: If you are using seconds and are given a time in minutes, make sure to convert the units so they are all the same.  Simplify: Straighten out the clutter in an equation by putting like terms together. Constants, such as 7, -2, 28, group together, as do terms with the same variable, such as 3x, x, -10x. Then combine the like terms. Often you'll find that the equation practically solves itself.  Balance the equation: When you perform an operation on one side of an equation—such as adding or subtracting a number, or multiplying or dividing the entire side by a quantity—do the exact same thing to the other side. This keeps things in balance.  Above all, check your work! When you have finished a problem, ask yourself, "Does this answer make sense?" Plug your solution into the original equation to see if it does. Checking your work is the number one insurance policy for accurate work—the step that separates good students from superstar students.  By developing habits such as these, you will discover that solving algebra problems becomes a pleasure and not a chore—just as in a sport in which you have mastered the rudiments and are ready to face a competitor. Algebra I gives you the inspirational instruction, repetition, and practice to excel at what for many students is the most dreaded course in high school. Open yourself to the world of opportunity that algebra offers by making the best possible start on this all-important subject.  LECTURES  36Lectures  Professor Sellers introduces the general topics and themes for the course, describing his approach and recommending a strategy for making the best use of the lessons and supplementary workbook. Warm up with some simple problems that demonstrate signed numbers and operations. Continue your study of math fundamentals by exploring various procedures for converting between percents, decimals, and fractions. Professor Sellers notes that it helps to see these procedures as ways of presenting the same information in different forms. Continuing your exploration of rational expressions, try your hand at multiplying and dividing them. The key to solving these complicated-looking equations is to proceed one step at a time. Close the lesson with a problem that brings together all you've learned about rational functions.  Examine the distinctive graphs formed by rational functions, which may form vertical or horizontal curves that aren't even connected on a graph. Learn to identify the intercepts and the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of these fascinating curves. Pattern recognition is an important and fascinating mathematical skill. Investigate two types of number patterns: geometric sequences and arithmetic sequences. Learn how to analyze such patterns and work out a formula that predicts any term in the sequence The Pennsylvania State University Ph.D., The Pennsylvania State University  Dr. James A. Sellers is Professor of Mathematics and Director of Undergraduate Mathematics at The Pennsylvania State University. He earned his B.S. in Mathematics from The University of Texas at San Antonio and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Penn State.  In the past few years, Professor Sellers has received the Teresa Cohen Mathematics Service Award from the Penn State Department of Mathematics and the Mathematical Association of America Allegheny Mountain Section Mentoring Award.  More than 60 of Professor Sellers's research articles on partitions and related topics have been published in a wide variety of peer-reviewed journals. In 2008, he was a visiting scholar at the Isaac Newton Institute at the University of Cambridge.  Professor Sellers has enjoyed many interactions at the high school and middle school levels. He has served as an instructor of middle-school students in the TexPREP program in San Antonio, Texas. He has also worked with Saxon Publishers on revisions to a number of its high-school textbooks. As a home educator and father of five, he has spoken to various home education organizations about mathematics curricula and teaching issues.  VIDEO OR AUDIO?

__label__0 8th Grade Algebra I - Mrs. Loch  Welcome to my website which is designed to inform you of the procedures, events, and learning activities for the 2012-2013 school year.  My name is Mrs. Loch and I am the Math teacher for the 8th grade Red Team.  This year 8th grade students will gain knowledge in the areas of number sense, geometry, expressions and equations, functions, statistics and probability. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of algebraic concepts. Students will begin to explore patterns, relations, and functions. They will learn to represent and analyze mathematical situations using algebraic symbols and graphing in preparation for high school. The course will emphasize problem-solving strategies and incorporate applications to real world situations while aiding students in becoming 21st century learners.  This year we will be utilizing the "Flipped Classroom" concept. Students will watch instructional videos at home at their own pace. Class time will be spent communicating with peers and the teacher in discussions about the video, completing practice problems related to the topic, and doing interactive activities to illustrate the concept. For more information regarding the "Flipped Classroom," see "What is the Flipped Classroom?" in the document section to the right.  For valuable information regarding algebra class, assignments, or to see what we have coming up in class, please view the content below or the links listed in the "classroom pages" section to the right.

Math on the job:  In general the math skills Tracy uses in her job are basic math, algebra, and geometry.Of course, averaging and normalizing scores is a big part of her paper work.Tracy found many of the projects she was involved with during her internships interesting, but her favorite dealt with proportions and scale.The class was split up into small groups and was told to take accurate measurements ofa Barbie doll.Through the lesson, the students not only learned how to use scale and proportion, but they also learned just how unrealistic Barbie is.  Tracy's background:  Tracy graduated from NortheasternStateUniversity with a B.S. degree in Secondary Mathematics Education in December, 2004.She says that she will be calling upon all the math skills she has acquired through both school and 20 years of tutoring.When asked what other skills are needed, she simply said, "There are too many to name."  Advice for students:  Her very important advice to leave with any high school or college student interested in pursuing mathematics is to "hang in there and form study groups whenever possible.Do your best to really understand the material that is being presented because it is more important to learn than to make an A."
__label__0 Excellent resource for the class! I like your style and I'm interested in your products and store! I'm your new follower! You can visit my store and leave a comment if you wish! hugs and Happy Easter! Hernan  This lesson is the introduction to a unit on Functions for Algebra 2 Honors students. The lesson is taught at the beginning of the school year when students may not be quite prepared for the rigor of Algebra 2 Honors. It is just a general review of the basic vocabulary that will be needed throughout the unit. While we may think the lesson is touching only at the surface, students continue to struggle throughout the school year with domain, range, and function notation. It is interesting to discuss the ideas of continous domains and discrete domains for Example #3 and the idea that function notation indicates the coordinate. Both of these ideas are introduced to students in this textbook here and the understanding continues to grow through the next two courses. I would be glad to send you another lesson for your dissatisfaction. Contact me at jean.adams@ocps.net  no, you can teach the lesson by just placing the Foldable under a document camera. I use a wireless slate and the smart notebook software. This way I can use the lesson repeatedly and write on the smart lesson fresh each class. I believe there are other ways that smart software can display. possibly with an iPad and splashtop software. you might ask a tech person in your school.  May 21, 2013  Julie Larsen re: ALG 2 UNIT: Sequences and Series FOLDABLES ONLY  The quality of the notes is great. My big question is...how do I tell which is page 1, 2, 3, etc. It seems essential in order to copy the pages correctly to make the foldable. I can figure some out based on the example numbers, however, is the Arithmetic Sequences with the vocab page 1, 2, etc. What page number is the Arithmetic sequences with the formulas?  The foldable was created in order. If your printer copies on two sides, you can choose to flip them on the short side and they copy double sided in the correct order. The vocabulary is always the first or front page and the side with the blank sheet on the third page of the document will be the last sheet or page 8 on the foldable. My students glue this blank page into their composition books to save them in order of their textbook lessons. In this particular lesson, the formulas appear on the 5th page of the foldable. If you need more assistance, you can email me at jean@j-adams.com  You might think this is a crazy question, but I am trying to figure out something. On problem B, which has 2Z + B = ____, if you only have say 6 brown or Z M&M's, how are you showing the 2 times Z with the M&M's? My husband and myself are both math teachers and we are trying to use this lesson as a dynamic lesson in an 8th grade math classroom. We love the idea. Thank you! my email is acawood@roaneschools.com or avols845@hotmail.com  Amy, If I understand your question correctly, I think you mean since Z=Brown M&M's and B=Blue M&M's if you have 6 brown the question in the B prompt has two equations 2Z + B = ___ and Z-B = ____. Students would write 2Z + B = 6 and Z-B=6. Now, say that the students bag had only 3 blue M&M's, and had 6 brown M&M's. Their system would now read2Z+B=9 and Z-B=3. When students use substitution method or elimination method, they will get Z=6 and B=3 for the answer if their algebra is correct. Hope this helps.  Yes, each lesson has a full answer key. Whether you purchase the single lesson or the set of handouts only or Smartboard Lessons only, each has the answer key provided.  April 7, 2013  mhilvert  I recently bought the Families of Functions Foldable book and am having a hard time figuring out how to put it together correctly. Do you have any suggestions? Everytime I put it together the 'summary of transformations' page is between #5/6 and #7/8? Thanks  I have uploaded a more detailed assembly directions for you which shows the layout for printing. You can see this free document at Foldable Assembly Directions. If you still have trouble, please let me know. Thanks.  My colleague and I bought this unit but we are having a hard time with the foldables. I've created this type of booklet before. I tried to create yours several times but the pages are all out of order. The question I have is about the copies. Is there a certain way these need to be copied?  Yes, the copies should be double sided. If you have a printer that prints on both sides of the paper, you can choose to flip the paper on the short side to create the proper order. If you print the four pages single-sided and us a copy machine, orient the pages so that page 1 and page 3 are up and pages 2 and 4 are down. I will send you a snapshot personally, if you will send me your email address. I'm sorry you are having difficulty. pre-calculus and calculus threeThat's a good question. I use Smart Notebook 11 software to write my lessons for display. They are shared with my students through a projector but I use an wireless slate in order to teach the lessons "Live" to my students. The smart file that I sell is a blank document. You need to have the ability to work the problems on some wireless writing tablet. There are many that are compatible with Smart Technology products. I don't believe just a projector will work for this product. You can purchase the foldables only for this unit and write on that document under your document camera to display through the projector. If this is confusing, ask an "IT" person at your school. Unless you have a wireless tablet it would waste your money. Thanks, Jean Adams  Hi Chris, Thanks for the vote on my clean writing style. Yes, I do sell the whole Quadratics Unit as a set. You can purchase the Foldables only at  or Smart Notes only, as well.  My students buy a small composition book at the beginning of the school year. The last page of each Foldable is blank so they apply glue and glue them into their book each day. I have some students who work their homework after each lesson in the composition book. They use two books each year in that case. Then, I have some students who store their lessons in a Gallon-Sized Zip-Lock Bag. I really see "ownership" in what they do by the way they protect each document and never want me to skip any example.  Hi Amy, Yes they will. I've got three more to finish. Hopefully, today. There are nine in all. I got behind with Thanksgiving and Christmas. Sorry. I know you are waiting. I'm working on them now. Thanks for your loyalty. Jean  Yes, it should include 5 documents, a cover page, the foldable as a PDF file, the Final notes as a PDF File, the SmartBoard Lesson, and direction for making the foldable. I'll repost the files for you. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks for letting me know. Jean Adams  Is it intended that the section of student notes on Extrema on an Interval is missing some information and examples that are in the filled in teacher version? The other units I have purchased matched up exactly to one another...  I'll check into that for you. Thanks for the watchful eye. Jean Yes Amy, Actually my students had a difficult time with this idea last year. They forgot to check the endpoints, so we went back to the notes, revisited the procedure, thought about a few "What if" situations, and I just left that in the presentation to give a little extra while we talked and taught the lesson. So it is intentional.  November 26, 2012  mkesselman re: Blank Unit Circle Small  You have an extra degree symbol at both 90 degrees and at 270 degrees.  Two questions: The file '4 Real Zeros of Polynomial Functions Cover.pdf' is generating an error message from Adobe that the file is damaged and cannot be repaired. What program is needed to open the file with the 'notebook' extension? Is this a SmartBoard file?  Yes, the *.PDF file was corrupt. I have uploaded a version that should work now. Please let me know if it doesn't. The notebook extension is a SmartNotebook 11 document. You can open with a Smart Notebook 11 software, and I believe it is compatible with Prometheus products also. I personally use my presentation files only with the Smart Airliner Wireless slate.  No, I don't. I have a Smart Airliner Wireless Slate. It costs about $200 and allows me to walk around my room. I actually had an older model of SmartBoard and gave it up when the Wireless slate came out about 3 years ago. I love it. I'm no longer tied to the front of the classroom. Even my students can write on the slate from their seats. The software SMART NOTEBOOK 11 is a separate item, I write the lessons with that software and use the slate to teach the lesson.

__label__0 Our middle school math program has 3 levels: honors, average, and 6th grade math. All students study pre-algebra topics in 6th grade. This includes exemplars, geometry topics and ISAT test preparation.  In 7th grade, a majority of students (all honors and regular levels) begin algebra 1. Half of the algebra curriculum is taught in 7th grade and the remaining algebra 1 curriculum is taught in 8th grade. These students then enter into geometry classes as freshmen in high school.  The 7th grade (honors and pre algebra) Algebra 1 curriculum includes: properties of real numbers, solving linear equations and inequalities, and graphing in the x-y coordinate plane, some geometry, as well as ISAT test preparation and an introduction to the use of the graphing calculator.  Students that do not take algebra in 7th grade continue with a general middle school math program in 7th and 8th grades. Their curriculum includes the study of fractions, decimals, signed numbers, percents, and selected geometry topics and ISAT test preparation.
__label__0 Topology is a major branch of modern mathematics. Topology is often described as rubber sheet geometry. In geometry objects are considered rigid with fixed distances and angles, but in topology distances and angles can be deformed. In topology objects are treated as if they are made out of rubber, capable of being deformed. Objects are allowed to be bent, stretched or shrunk but not allowed to be ripped apart or cut.  For example, in topology a coffee mug and a doughnut are the same! This kind of equivalence is cleverly illustrated by the following animated gif written by Lucas V. Barbosa.  In this course we will develop the mathematical framework to understand some of these ideas.  The authors of our textbook write:  Topology is generally considered to be one of the three linchpins of modern abstract mathematics (along with analysis and algebra). In the early history of topology, results were primarily motivated by investigations of real-world problems. Then, after the formal foundation for topology was established in the first part of the twentieth century, the emphasis turned to its abstract development. However, within the past few decades there has been a significant increase in the applications of topology to fields as diverse as economics, engineering, chemistry, medicine, and cosmology.  When your instructor was a student (in the middle of the last century) topologists never talked about applications – it is exciting to see the range of applications that have been found for this abstract subject. Because we have limited class time, our emphasis will be an introduction to the theory of point-set topology (text chapters 0-7). Students may wish to pursue some of these applications for individual projects.  Course Objectives  Most of the work you will need to do in this class will require reading the textbook and solving homework exercises (these will focus on creating and explaining mathematical arguments). I expect you to work collaboratively with other students and I hope you will talk to me about any exercises you are unsure about (either face to face or via email). I will try to give sufficient lead time to make this possible. Although I encourage you to work with others, I want you to write up your solutions individually.  In addition to reading your homework exercises and talking with you in class, I'd like you to take a few minutes each weekend to send me a brief update on how things are going (an email journal). I won't grade these critically but I hope they will give me some guidance on how things are progressing and I will record that you have sent them.  After we've worked through some preliminary definitions, I'd like you to think about possible topics for an individual project. There are many topics in the textbook that I will not have time to discuss in class and you might want to choose one of these. (We'll start putting together a list of topics and scheduling presentations after the first six weeks.) An individual project should include a 15-20 minute presentation to the class and a short writeup (3-5 pages).  Both the midterm and the final exam will include take-home as well as in-class questions.
__label__0 Qualification through placement, or a grade of C or better in Math 111 or 115.  Text:  Applied Calculus by Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, Lock, Flath, et al.  Calculator:  Each student is required to have a graphing calculator. My instructions will predominantly be for TI-83 which is the preferred calculator for this course.  Overview: One of the main objectives of this course is for you to understand the basic concepts of calculus well enough to know when, how, and why to apply them in real-world situations and to be able to interpret and communicate the results. To achieve this goal will require practice at a variety of numerical, graphical, and algebraic methods.  The preface of the book provides additional detail and insight into the methods you will encounter in this course. Page xii is particularly well-written but the entire preface is worth reading.  We will work through most of chapters 1 -- 5, and parts of chapter 6.  Attendance: You are expected to come to every class on time and stay until the end of class. If you miss one day of class during the summer session, it's almost as bad as missing an entire week during the fall or spring.  Work Load: A standard rule of thumb for math classes is that you should study 2-3 hours outside of class for each hour spent in class. We are scheduled to meet 9 hours per week in class. This leaves an additional 18-27 hours per week to study outside of class.  Grading: There will be daily reading and homework, but your grade will only be based upon your score on the 4 tests. No make-ups will be given for any of these tests. If you miss a test for any reason, you will get a 0 on that test. There will be an optional cumulative test on the last day of class which can replace the lowest of your 4 test scores. There will be no final exam.

__label__0 Elementary Algebra for College Students: Early Graphing, Second Edition  Glossary  The distance between that number and zero on the number line. When we find the absolute value of a number, we use the notation. To illustrate,  Absolute value inequalities  Inequalities that contain at least one absolute value expression.  Addend  When two or more numbers are added, the numbers being added are called addends. In the problem 3 + 4 = 7, the numbers 3 and 4 are both addends.  Additive identity element  0.  Additive inverses or opposites  For any number a, its additive inverse is -a.  Algebraic expression  An algebraic expression consists of variables, numerals, and operation signs.  Algebraic fraction  An expression of the form , where P and Q are polynomials and Q is not zero. Algebraic fractions are also called rational expressions. For example, are algebraic fractions.  Altitude of a geometric figure  The height of the geometric figure. In the three figures shown the altitude is labeled a.  Altitude of a triangle  The height of any given triangle. In the three triangles shown the altitude is labeled a.  Amount of a percent equation  The product we obtain when we multiply a percent times a number. In the equation 75 = 50% x 150, the amount is 75.  Approximate value  A value that is not exact. The approximate value of , correct to the nearest tenth, is 1.7. The symbol is used to indicate "is approximately equal to." We write  Area  The total surface area within a figure's boundaries.  Associative property of addition  The property that tells us that when three numbers are added, it does not matter which two numbers are added first. An example of the associative property is 5 + (1 + 2) = (5 + 1) + 2. Whether we add 1 + 2 and then add 5 to that, or add 5 + 1 and then add that result to 2, we will obtain the same result.  Associative property of multiplication  The property that tells us that when we multiply three numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we group together first to multiply; the result will be the same. An example of the associative property of multiplication is 2 x (5 x 3) = (2 x 5) x 3.  Asymptote  A line that a curve continues to approach but never actually touches. Often an asymptote is a helpful reference in making a sketch of a curve, such as a hyperbola.  Asymptotes of a hyperbola  Two lines through the center of the hyperbola that help in graphing the hyperbola.  Augmented matrix  A matrix derived from a linear system of equations. It consists of the coefficients of each variable in a linear system and the constants. The augmented matrix of the system is the matrix . Each row of the augmented matrix represents an equation of the system.  Axis of symmetry  The imaginary line about which a graph is symmetric.  Axis of symmetry of a parabola  A line passing through the focus and vertex of a parabola, about which the two sides of the parabola are symmetric. See the sketch.
__label__0 Subject : Mathematics  Awarding body: Edexcel:  There are two routes for attaining an A level in Mathematics. The standard route is outlined below but those who wish to take Further Mathematics will need to complete all six units in Year 12.  Course content and examination requirements:  AS Level Course content:  At this level you will study two pure mathematics units (C1 and C2) and a statistics unit (S1).  In pure mathematics algebra and trigonometry are continued in greater depth and the techniques of Calculus are further developed.In statistics, there is work on probability and representing data. New topics such as correlation, regression, discrete randomvariables and the Normal distribution are introduced.  A2 level Course content:  Three further units are studied, two pure units (C3 and C4) and an applied unit (usually a mechanics unit (M1) Units C3 and C4 extend the topics studied at AS level and vector theory is introduced. In mechanics, basic principles of Newtonian Mechanics are introduced and topics such as equations of motion, moments and momentum are covered.  A2 Level Assessment:  Each unit is assessed by one examination paper lasting 1 hour 30 minutes. Each paper has equal weighting (16.67% of A level).  C1 is a non-calculator examination  Year 12 - AS Units  Year 13 - A2 Units (full GCE)  Unit C1  Unit C1: One hour thirty minutes examination (33.33% of AS/16.67% of A level). No calculator may be used.  Unit C3  Unit C3: One hour thirty minutes examination (16.67% of A level).  Unit C2  Unit C2: One hour thirty minutes examination (33.33% of AS/16.67% of A level).  Unit C4  Unit C4: One hour thirty minutes examination (16.67% of A level).  Unit S1  Unit S1: One hour thirty minutes examination (33.33% of AS/16.67% of A level).  Another applied unit  One hour thirty minutes examination (16.67% of A level).  Entry requirements:  A minimum GCSE Grade A in Mathematics is required.  Relevance to further studies and careers:  An A level in Mathematics is not only useful for all those interested in the Sciences, Business and Economics, Medicine and Geography, but it also provides a broader education for those interested in Arts subjects.  Choosing Mathematics at an advanced level opens many career opportunities and an A level Mathematics qualification is highly regarded by Universities.  Teaching staff / further information:  Please contact Mrs M Collett (Head of Mathematics).  All members of the department are involved in the teaching of Mathematics A level.
__label__0 Specification  Aims  To give an introduction to Lebesgue's theory of measure and integration on the set of real numbers R. To use this to find an appropriate setting in which to understand the convergence of Fourier series.  Brief Description of the unit  It is often convenient to represent functions as Fourier series. However, the convergence of such series is a delicate issue closely related to the theory of integration. A standard approach to integration on the real line, formalised by Riemann, is based on partitioning the domain into smaller intervals. (This theory was described in MATH20101 but is not a prerequisite for the course.) This approach works in many situations but there are simple examples for which it fails. In the early 1900s, H. Lebesgue produced a better theory in which the key idea is to extend the notion of length from intervals to more complicated subsets of R. This started an area of mathematics it its own right, called Measure Theory. Most generally, this is about how one may sensibly assign a size to members of a collection of sets. One application of Lebesgue's ideas is that one can introduce a vector space of functions in which Fourier series appear in a natural way.  This course will appeal to students who have enjoyed MATH20101 or MATH20111 and MATH20122. It will be useful to student taking probability course courses in years three and four since the ideas of measure theory have a central role in probability theory.  Learning Outcomes  On successful completion of this course unit students will  understand how Lebesgue measure on R is defined,  understand how measures may be used to construct integrals,  know the basic convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral,  understand the relation between Fourier series and the Hilbert space of square integrable functions.

__label__0 The new Math 100-110 sequence was designed by the math department to accomplish two things: 1) offer students a two-semester sequence of courses that would allow students to master the same academic content one would find in the one-semester college algebra course Math 140; and 2) do so in a way that recognizes that not all students arrive on campus prepared to do college-level work in mathematics. Though a student can earn college credit by taking Math 100, only Math 110 satisfies the general education requirement. Students may not enroll in Math 110 without first completing Math 100 with at least a grade of C.  Math 100 was offered for the very first time in Fall 2011. In this colloquium talk, Curtis and Barbara will report on the department's first outing with this course.  Purpose: The University of Tennessee, Martin, Department of Mathematics and Statistics holds colloquium talks several times each semester. These talks are open to the general public, and we encourage all interested parties to attend. The colloquia are intended to provide a friendly, informal, and scholarly forum for presenting and discussing topics relevant to mathematics and statistics

__label__0 In this Unit we deal with trigonometric identities. These identities are particularly useful in doing the algebra of trigonometry. In this application of the identities complex expressions are simplified and converted into different equivalent forms. This algebraic nature of trigonometry is taught at secondary school level, not only as a stepping stone towards further tertiary studies, which may require some form of trigonometry knowledge, but also as a tool to develop learners' logical reasoning.  Often learners don't know how to start to prove an identity without any hint, even if they know every trigonometric formula. In this unit we will explore some general ideas to prove an identity, and in doing so provide an opportunity for you to pass this on to your learners, in order to improve their mathematics problem solving skills.  The usual approach to identities is the memorisation of the basic identities with little or no reference to the graphical meaning of the identities. The learners are then expected to be able to substitute and manipulate to prove given more complex identities. In this module we will try to give some graphical interpretation of the use of identities.

For anyone who has ever felt intimidated by a page of numbers, Quick Arithmetic, Third Edition has the answers!  Customer Reviews:  A bad start  By Robert Patton - August 30, 2006  This book looks decent on the whole, but it gets off to an annoyingly bad start. The way it is structured is that your ability to answer or not answer questions guides you to different sections within the book. The first chapter starts off with a preview quiz, to get you started on your path. Yet the very first question on the quiz has the wrong answer. So when you check your results and think you got it wrong - try it again. The answer given is off by 20. This would be unbelievable in a self teaching guide if I didn't have it right in front of me. I can understand a mistake here and there, but the very first question??!! And, of course, no way to contact the authors to see if they have released accurate answers or let them know. Now the entire book is suspect. There is also some confusion shortly after as the authors draw a clear distinction between a digit as a representation of an idea, then give a question using characters (which are the same, representations of sounds)... read more  A great math refresher course  By M. kelton - January 6, 2007  I found myself floundering while trying to help with Algebra ll homework.

__label__0 Mathematics  The Mathematics curriculum is structured to best address the broad needs of students. All courses are designed for students who learn best in an applied approach. The department advances five major goals for students:  Learn to value mathematics as a tool to explore relationships between mathematics and the many disciplines it serves.  Gain confidence in using mathematical power to make sense of new problem situations and the world we live in.  Develop ability in solving problem situations independently and in a cooperative group setting.  Given opportunities to read, write and discuss ideas, use the signs, symbols and terms of mathematics.  Gather evidence, make conjectures, develop and support rationale using mathematical reasoning.  The Mathematics department also applies the six guiding Principles of the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks:  Guiding Principle 1: Learning  Mathematical ideas should be explored in ways that stimulate curiosity, create enjoyment of mathematics, and develop depth of understanding.  Guiding Principle 2: Teaching  An effective mathematics program is based on a carefully designed set of content standards that are clear and specific, focused, and articulated over time as a coherent sequence.  Guiding Principle 3: Technology  Technology is an essential tool that should be used strategically in mathematics education.  Guiding Principle 4: Equity  All students should have a high quality mathematics program that prepares them for college and a career.  Guiding Principle 5: Literacy Across the Content Areas  An effective mathematics program builds upon and develops students' literacy skills and knowledge.  Guiding Principle 6: Assessment  Assessment of student learning in mathematics should take many forms to inform instruction and learning.  Students are required to successfully complete the objectives of six credits of mathematics coursework but may elect up to eight credits. Aspects of mathematics that emphasize real-life situations are integrated regularly throughout all the mathematics courses. All courses are college preparatory and fully address the goals and objectives of the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks.  The Honors mathematics pathway moves from Algebra II to Geometry to Advanced Algebra and Pre Calculus with senior year expectation of Calculus. Additional electives are available dependent upon student career plans. The majority of students follows a college preparatory pathway beginning with Algebra I but may elect Honors-level courses.  The need for technological proficiency is recognized at all levels and in all courses. Students are encouraged and trained to use calculators to speed arithmetic calculations, for advanced analysis, and to explore relationships and concepts, visualize solutions and promote hypothetical modeling of real-life situations. Additional methods utilizing computer software for exploration and analysis are also employed in all courses.

__label__0 Discrete mathematics and finite mathematics differ in a number of ways. First, finite mathematics has a longer history and is therefore more stable in terms of course content. Finite mathematics courses emphasize certain particular mathematical tools which are useful in solving the problems of business and the social sciences. Discrete mathematics courses, on the other hand, emphasize a particular guiding principle for all mathematical inquiry, namely the "algorithmic viewpoint." Discrete mathematics emphasizes mathematical induction and proofs, while finite mathematics avoids proofs and emphasizes applications and intuitive understanding. Because of this, finite mathematics is a terminal math course for many students, whereas discrete mathematics is an introductory course for its constituency. In spite of differences, courses in discrete and finite mathematics have similar prerequisites and cover a number of the same topics. The main difference between the two is the clientele served. Discrete mathematics courses serve mainly computer science students, and finite mathematics courses serve students from commerce and social science backgrounds. Therefore, and unfortunately, finite mathematics courses tend to be less rigorous. Given that mathematical expectations are rising for students in business and social sciences, a common course merging discrete and finite mathematics should be developed. A chart showing the overlap in the content of finite and discrete mathematics textbooks is attached.

On a more subtle plane, there is the question of the influence of the choice of the domain over which the coefficients are allowed to vary on the theory of the polynomials in question. Along these lines, we will provide an introduction to Galois Theory and a glimpse of algebraic number theory. Applications here will be made to the questions of solutions of equations by radicals, determining Pythagorean triples, expressing integers as sums of two squares, etc.  A second main topic will be an introduction to transformational geometry, the study of rigid motions in the plane. Application here will be made to congruence and similarity of geometric figures, a classification of the conic sections and a foundation for trigonometry.  These topics can be discussed very fruitfully on many different levels. We will make every effort to choose a level appropriate for those in attendance.

__label__0 Attend the 3rd Annual USACAS Conference  Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) have the potential to revolutionize mathematics education at the secondary level. They do for Algebra & Calculus what calculators do for arithmetic: simplify expressions, solving equations, factoring, taking derivatives, and much more.  With CAS, students have the power to solve many problems earlier – some which would otherwise remain inaccessible. CAS enable one to delay the teaching of some manipulative skills and completely eliminate others.  In short, CAS grant teachers new freedom.  Come explore the future of mathematics education!  Discover how secondary and middle school teachers are using CAS in their own classrooms.  Get classroom-tested lesson ideas developed for CAS-enhanced classroom environments.

__label__0 Mathematics  Some people study mathematics for its own sake. They find algebra, calculus, geometry and logic interesting and they love a challenge. Others study it because they will work in a mathematics-related field, such as finance, statistics, physics, engineering, chemistry – the list goes on. Whether you are one of these people or not, any study of mathematics, great or small, will strengthen your reasoning skills.  At College of DuPage, we serve all of these different types of people with their different goals. Whether the math courses you take at College of DuPage are transferred to a four-year college or university, are refresher courses that improve your basic skills, or used to prepare you for a new job, you can be confident that you will receive a high-quality education from a strong faculty interested in you successfully learning mathematics.  Resources:  LearningExpress Library is a comprehensive, interactive online learning platform of practice tests and tutorial course series designed to help patrons—students and adult learners—succeed on the academic or licensing tests they must pass.  Spotlight  "I was talking with a friend of mine who attends UIC, and he was surprised at the topics that we covered in my Calculus II class at COD that he never learned until later classes. The education provided at COD is first-rate and even better in some areas when compared to big universities. I'm getting a quality yet affordable education at College of DuPage."  "COD has time and time again proven to have been the best option for me because of the variety of classes, which helped me make the decisions about my life that were right for me," Sandy Pieta said. "I couldn't have done it without the support of my friends, family and, above all, dedicated COD faculty members, especially James Allen, who helped me find my true path in life to become a math teacher.  "I am very grateful for the opportunity to take advanced classes with such great professors as Bob Cappetta and James Africh," he said. "COD gave me the opportunity to challenge myself and learn more while still a full-time high school student. This enabled me to 'hit the ground running' in my full-time studies at Vanderbilt without having to for

__label__0 Why Study Maths?  A Mathematics qualification beyond GCSE is always highly regarded by university admissions tutors and by employers. In fact there are some courses at university which require you to have Mathematics at AS or A2. We offer a wide variety of Mathematics courses:  AS and A2 Further Mathematics  AS and A2 Mathematics  AS use of Mathematics  GCSE Mathematics and Level 1/Level 2 Adult Numeracy  AS and A2 Statistics  AS Mathematics supports many other subjects but especially Physics and Computing.  You choose which applied modules to study as part of AS/A2 Mathematics. i.e. Statistics, Mechanics or Decision Mathematics.  The "problem solving" aspect of Mathematics is very satisfying especially when you turn to the back of the textbook and find you've got the right answer!  Your tutors are well qualified and committed to ensuring that you do well. There are regular workshops staffed by teachers where extra help is available.  Which Maths should I choose? Statistics links with Economics, Business Studies, Biology, Geography, Journalism, Psychology, Medicine, Pharmacy, Law and Education.  Use of Maths is useful if you need Maths to support other subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Electronics and Computing.  Further Maths is useful for careers in Maths, Engineering and Computer Science.  AS and A2 Statistics is useful if you want to develop the skills needed to work with data, but don't want to do lots of traditional maths like algebra. AS and A2 Statistics links well with subjects like Biology, Business, Sociology and Pyschology.  The UK Senior Maths Challenge This is open to any of our AS and A2 level Maths students. It is designed to stimulate mental agility and mathematical reasoning and the paper consists of 25 puzzles with multiple choice answers. Gold, silver and bronze certificates are awarded to many participants, with the most successful being invited to the British Mathematical Olympiad.

To store an operation to Op1 or Op2 and recall it: 1. Press %b or %c. 2. Enter the operation, beginning with an operator (such as +, M, Q, P, or ^). You can store any combination of numbers, operators, and menu items and their arguments, to a limit of 47 characters or items. 3. Press V to save the operation to memory. 4. Each subsequent time you press 2 or 3, the TI-36X recalls the stored operation and applies it to the last answer. The expression with the stored operation appears on the first line of the display, and the result appears on the second line. A counter on the left side of the result line displays the number of consecutive times you have pressed Op1 or Op2. You can set the TI-36X to display only the counter and the result, and not the expression on the entry line. Press %b or %c, press ! until the = is highlighted () and press V. Repeat to toggle this setting off.

To prepare for an integral, store the lower limit in memory variable A, the upper limit in memory B, and the number of intervals (from 1 to 99) in memory C. Press 0 and enter the expression, using memory variable A as the independent variable. Then press V. While the calculator is processing the data, CALC displays. When the calculation is successfully completed, the TI-36X will return the numerical value to the result line. In addition, the calculator will clear memory variable C; A and B will be equal to the upper limit. If A>B, or if C is not an integer 1-99, or if A, B, or C is undefined, Integrate Error will display, and A, B, and C will be cleared. If you want to solve a given problem again using a different number of intervals or different limits, enter values to store in memory variables A, B, and C. Then scroll to the integration problem in history and press V; the calculator will solve the same problem with the new data. The time the calculator takes to solve the problem depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of intervals. You can abort the calculation by pressing and holding T until Integrate Error is displayed. With polynomials up to the third degree, Simpsons rule yields the exact answer, so increasing the number of intervals will not change the results. However, with polynomials of higher degree and equations containing more complicated functions (such as trigonometry), increasing the number of intervals will improve the precision of the results. Note: When you perform integration with trigonometric functions, the calculator must be in radian mode. 30  LN EXP PWR CLRDATA  You can enter up to 42 points or data pairs. When using the LN regression, you do not need to find the natural logarithms of the numbers. Enter the data directly, and the TI-36X makes the transformation. Similarly, when you want to make a prediction with the LN regression equation, you enter the value of x directly (and not ln x), and the calculator returns the predicted value of y (and not ln y).

__label__0 the only conceptual demand that is somewhat independent of the context is manipulating the algebraic expression to yield simpler algebraic expressions. That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of "x+3-ness" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.  One hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to "demonstrate further" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.  For the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. "Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed."66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.  Even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation.  Predicting Patterns  Tasks involving geometric and numerical patterns are a frequent means of introducing students to the use of algebra for predicting. Problem B in Box 8–8 is typical. To help students find a pattern in the arrangement of dots
__label__0 Working with vectors  The following fast-loading webpages describe some properties and physical applications of vectors. Each section builds on the previous ones to make a logical sequence and I have used hot links within sections so that it is easy to refer back if you want to.  September 2003 The second edition of my book Maths: a student's survival guide is published this month. I've registered &nbsp  as its homepage in case I change my ISP. There is a link from there to this page. For this new edition, I've included some changes and additions to the text arising from reader feedback and suggestions. I've also added a new chapter on vectors which will be based on these pages. Putting them in book form has made it possible to expand them and add lots of examples and problems. If you want any more information please email me by taking out the xyz from xyzjenolive@netcomuk.co.uk but please don't send attachments as I don't open them. The xyz is against robot viruses.  Here is a list of all the vector topics which I've included so far on this site.
__label__0 Mathematics  Why study Mathematics?  An essential element of mathematical learning is the development of mathematical knowledge in a way which encourages confidence and provides satisfaction and enjoyment. It is expected that students will gain an appreciation of the use of mathematical skills within other subjects as well as an understanding of problem solving in the real world.  Which specification is followed?  Girls in Lower School follow the National Framework for Mathematics as laid down by the National Curriculum and the National Numeracy Strategy. From Lower 4 onwards pupils are taught in sets according to attainment.  In 2009, Bradford Girls' Grammar School embarked on the iGCSE course following the Edexcel specification. Candidates are encouraged to develop a feel for numbers; to recognise patterns and relationships; to generalise results; and to use the language of mathematics to communicate their ideas effectively and efficiently. All candidates will be studying a course leading to the higher tier examinations, but individual students may be entered at Foundation Level if appropriate. The iGCSE does not have a coursework element. Marks are obtained from sitting two examination papers at the end of Upper 5. The iGCSE is an excellent preparation for students intending to study mathematics at A-level.  Mathematics and Further Mathematics are offered at both AS and A level following the Edexcel specifications. In recent years the role of Further Mathematics has changed. It is seen as enriching and deepening the curriculum: truly further maths rather than just harder maths – it provides able students with a course which stimulates them mathematically and prepares them for a wide range of higher education options.  At A level students study three main areas of mathematics:  Pure (or Core) Mathematics which develops and extends topics already met at GCSE including algebra, trigonometry and graphs, it also introduce new topics such as calculus.  Statistics which includes the presentation, analysis and interpretation of data and the study of probability.  Mechanics which involves the study of the motion of objects and how they respond to forces acting on them.  Further Mathematics will cover Decision Mathematics in addition to the three areas mentioned above.  Workshops, conferences and visits  Mathematics workshops are offered during lunchtimes, providing help and support to students in all years.  Girls throughout Bradford Girls' Grammar School participate in the Mathematical challenges, including the Junior and Senior Team Challenges, run by the UK Mathematics Trust.  Degree and career choices  There are many opportunities to study Mathematics in the Sixth Form at Bradford Girls' Grammar and it is an excellent support subject for any combination of 'A' levels. It is not an easy subject to study at this level and its academic rigour means that it is highly valued by universities for entry into most degree programme,s particularly the sciences, geography, economics, psychology, medicine and engineering.
__label__0 MATH40237 Fundamental Mathematics for University  Course details  Fundamental Mathematics for University is designed to provide students with foundation concepts, rules and methods of elementary mathematics.

Topics covered in the course include operations, percentages, introductory algebra, simple equation solving, exponents, linear equations, introductory statistics, and units and conversions
__label__0 Math software for students studying precalculus. Can be interesting for teachers teaching precalculus. Math Center Level 1 consists of Graphing calculator 2D, Advanced Calculator, Simple Calculator, Simple Calculator, Simple Rational Calculator, and Simple Integer Calculator called from the Control Panel. Simple calculator is a general purpose calculator which combines use simplicity and calculation power. It handles simple arithmetic operations and complex formulas. Advanced Calculator is a step farther in complexity comparing to the Simple Calculator. The Advanced Calculator has two editing windows. One is for editing x, and the second is for editing f(x). In the x window you can enter any number or formula which contains numbers. In the f(x) window you can enter formulas containing numbers and formulas containing x. First, x will be calculated. Then the result for x will be substituted into the formula for f(x). The presence of two editing windows demands switching between windows. You can do it by clicking buttons "go to x" and "go to f(x)", or by clicking inside the window. If you forget to enter x, then the x=1 will be assumed. If you forget to enter f(x), then f(x)=x will be assumed. Advanced Calculator works in scientific mode. All numbers in internal calculations are treated in scientific format. Graphing Calculator 2D has two panels. The Left Panel has the Magnifying Square represented by Small Square with gray border on the Left Panel. It is 16 times smaller than the Left Panel. The Right Panel shows content of the Magnifying Square magnified 16 times. You can press button "zoom +". Then the Left and Right Panels will be zoomed twice each. Maximum zoom is 8 (tree clicks of "zoom +"). Clicking button "C" (for Center) on Zoom returns picture to starting position with no zoom and Magnifying Square at the center of Left Panel.

__label__0 I've a not so profound background in math (just rusty high-school knowledge) and want to brush it up a little through self-study. I want to build a decent general foundation so I'm well prepared for more advanced topics. I don't know what exactly yet but probably some discrete math (comp. science), probability/statistics, maybe quantum-mechanics, ... .  I've a not so profound background in math (just rusty high-school knowledge) and want to brush it up a little through self-study...  I've read about 'The Princeton Companion to Mathematics' being good for someone with my background?  The Princeton Companion is not for this level of brush-up. It's the sort of book that you would use to explore new topics that you might not have seen before.  Quote:  Am I missing some more general topics or good resources?  If you're interested in getting deeper into math, you'll probably want to find a book that helps you to transition from computation into proof-based mathematics. Proofs are things that you don't really see in the high school math level. I like "How to Think Like a Mathematician" as a much gentler introduction than the more classic "A Transition to Advanced Mathematics" (and much less expensive).  There's another book on the market called "How to Prove It" but I've not read it so I can't say how good/bad it is. It seems to have decent reviews.  Doing questions/exercises is essential for quick progress in low-level maths.  In some of MIT's modules there are example sheets & solutions, which is good.  Basically, I would start by going and getting a basic book off amazon on algebra and/or geometry. Maybe a standard book on it, or just a questions and answer book.  Not sure what you mean by "algebra" though, as algebra is quite broad.  But yeah, work through a million questions, get used to things... don't be afraid to ask stuff on internet forums (like on 2+2) and also it's good to ask people you know if they're good enough and are willing to teach you a thing or two.  I'm not a math guy but this seems a bit narrow. I don't know how you'd get a good general overview, because there are dozens or hundreds of mathematical fields, often with overlap, but I know calculus and ODEs and I wouldn't say I "know math" even remotely.  It seems like abstract algebra is a good starting place since people who do "know math" seem to reference it a lot - set theory and number theory maybe? College-level geometry would probably be nice. Mathematical logic? Complex analysis?  I've learned some things in data structures, algorithms, numerical analysis, combinatorics, and computability theory, mostly as a result of reading about computer programming. That stuff is awesome to me but I don't even know how you'd get there from a "general mathematics" background. If you want computer math I recommend those topics though, I doubt you can do much with computers unless you have at least data structures, algorithms, and computability theory - but for "more discrete" tasks combinatorics is a must, and for "more continuous" tasks you really need numerical analysis. Might even want to study some more programming-related stuff too, knowing how floating-point types are implemented would be awfully valuable if you ever want to do math-related code.  I'll use 'How to Think Like a Mathematician' by Kevin Houston and skip 'The Princeton Companion' for now. Proofs seem to be very important and indeed in high-school we focused on computations.

I think the free ebooks from CK12.org are good? Problems with exercercises or questions I can post on several fora.  The 4 MIT OCW courses are 'Scholar' math-courses, specifically designed for self-study. I've already gone through some lectures on Calculus I and I think it's all pretty good organised (recitation videos, worked examples, exams (+solutions), ... ). I also read when you're a Math Major (General Option) those 4 courses are required while the rest is flexible. This is probably indeed far from a 'decent general background' but I guess I need to start somewhere.  Thanks. I think the information in your thread is going to be very helpful once I finish my 4 OCW Scholar courses. Right now I just finished Unit 1 (Differentiation) of Calculus 1, still a long way to go.   They have free courses for computer science and they just added a statistics 101 course, which has programming involved. It's a cool concept. They show short, well made video's, which are then followed up by questions you can answer to show you understood.  Unfortunately, it's been crazy easy so far. They are still adding the units for the statistics, so I'm assuming it will get more relevant (it's supposed to be university level).

__label__0 Starting with GeomLab  When you start GeomLab (by clicking on the Big Green Arrow), you may be asked for permission to run an application that has been signed by a "Thawte Freemail Member". If you click the link and examine the attached certficate, you will find that it is associated with Mike Spivey's e-mail address. After you give permission, a window appears that looks like this:  This window has two areas for text. In the small, lower area, you can type an expression like "2+3"; then either hold down the Shift key and press the Return key, or click with the mouse on the Go button at the right. (Pressing just Return in its own simply inserts a newline into the expression). GeomLab shows your expression in the upper area, followed by the value of the expression, like this:  All the expressions you type are added to the upper window, and you can use the scroll-bar at the right to look at the entire history of your session of work.  At its simplest, GeomLab can be used as a kind of calculator, showing the value of each expression that you enter. But expressions in GeomLab don't always have numbers as their values; some expressions evaluate to pictures. For example, the constant man has as its value a stick figure of a man:  GeomLab's response shows that the value of man is a picture, which is represented by "<picture>" in the list of expressions and values. But as well as showing this text, GeomLab also makes a new window appear that shows the picture itself:  Most of the interesting expressions and programs you will write as part of this activity will have pictures as their values.

__label__0 Scientific Computing  Scientific computing studies the world around us. Known and unknown quantities are related through certain rules, e.g. physical laws, formulating mathematical problems. These problems are solved by numerical methods implemented as algorithms and run on computers. The numerical methods are analyzed and their performance (e.g. accuracy, efficiency) studied. Problems, such as choosing the optimal shape for an airplane (to achieve, for example, minimal fuel consumption), finding the fair price for derivative products of the market, or regulating the amount of radiation in medical scans, can be modelled by mathematical expressions, and solved by numerical techniques.  Students wishing to study scientific computing should have a strong background in mathematics, in particular calculus of several variables, linear algebra and statistics, be fluent in programming, and have a good understanding of data structures and algorithm design.
__label__0 John Foradori's Math Blog Tips to survive the mathematics journey!Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000en-UShourly1 algebra classes  12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000John Foradori have fallen in love with the function-approach to algebra, and if I were teaching algebra 1, or even below that (as the CCSSM allows), everything would be taught from the perspective of a function.  Starting with functions from day one, you can reinforce everything about the functions, domains, ranges, families, etc with each and every lesson (just about!).  operations on expressions? Yep, start with a function that has the expressions you want. You can get so much more out of it. This can lead to so much more understanding. In class right now, students are dealing with rational functions in the form f(x)=a/(x-h) +k, finding the characteristics, then rewriting it as a quotient of two polynomials and comparing the graphs. Good stuff, and can be done with every type of function. I think it gives meaning to algebraic manipulation, why do we do it, what happens when we do it, and how does it really change the original function. These are powerful questions whose answers give real depth and meaning to the algebra classes.  I went through the EMATHS training, but the classes I taught never really let me explore the shifts that strongly (namely statistics and AP Calculus). I had a feeling that the function-based approach was, in my opinion, stronger and more flexible than the other way, but since I never had a chance to really explore it, it wasn't cemented.  It is now. Everything that can be done in a math class can be done from a function perspective and so much more. I will never go back!  There have been questions about learning procedures, the rigor of some of the algebraic skills like "simplifying" expressions, applying properties, etc. It's all there, all of it. It's just a different way of getting there.  I will leave this with a story. Since we were converting a rational function from one form to another, and to get the students thinking about what is going on, I took a piece of paper and told them this was a function. We can do a lot with a function in this form, and we came up with a lot of uses for it. Then I crumpled up the paper and asked how I changed the paper. Did I add anything? Did I take anything away? Is it still that original piece of paper, just dressed up differently? Then I asked about the uses of my crumpled up piece of paper. Can I do the same things? Can I do different things? I highlighted the different uses of the wad of paper by playfully tossing it around the room. When we discuss this as a group, hopefully we will get to the point that even if a function is in a different form, it really hasn't changed (check the graphs), but the uses for it have.  Wouldn't it be great if that idea can be reinforced almost all the time in Algebra 1 and Geometry, and not just at the end of the 3rd unit of Algebra 2?  The last couple of days have been heavy on the direct instruction. I saw that this group wasn't getting too much out of working in groups, and since the upcoming topics (logs, log properties, solving exponential and log equations) could be approached a little more traditional, I made the command decision to focus on small chunks of information and practice. So far, it's working pretty well.  These students are solving the equations graphically and then algebraically, which is all I can ask for right now. They are getting more and more comfortable with the tech and with the content, which will lead to next week and more group work on some exploration activities. They are making pretty good progress!  The room is filling up with a ton of chart paper: formula walls, word walls, procedure walls, Nspire shortcut walls…running out of walls!  ]]> Summer School Adventure! #1  30 Jun 2012 13:56:48 +0000John Foradori all (anyone that is taking time from their summer vacation to read this!)  I am one week in, and I have learned quite a bit of interesting things. I'll give a brief synopsis of the fun so far:  1. Set-up Setting up the technology was a bit of an issue. The biggest thing was getting the Ti-Navigator set up and running. I had to upgrade the operating systems first and do a lot of the hardware upgrades. Not a big deal, and not unexpected, but it took a few days to get them started. Finally, on Wednesday, I got the bugs worked out of the navigator, the class set up, and everything working. More on that later!  2. The Teaching Even being out of the classroom for only a year made the first couple of days a bigger challenge than I anticipated. My last classroom experience was a class I taught at Macomb CC, which is a little different than teaching in high school. I found myself falling back into that routine a little bit more than the high school routine. It took a couple of days for me, but I hit a groove during the day on Thursday.  3. The Students It took a while to get them into the swing of things as well. Summer school is an interesting experience, and can be a very dry, extremely oppressive atmosphere (in my opinion) for the students. Since it is credit recovery, they are there because of past failures, and their attitudes about math and math classes are very negative. Put them in a room that is high stakes, for five hours a day, and this could lead to a very negative atmosphere. So far, though, the students have been really good and have been participating, especially in the last couple of days. In fact, they are very engaged, and I think I've found the reason for it:  The Navigator System.  Once I got this thing up and running, and once I got used to it (it took me a couple of days, and I think the class slowed a bit because of it), things started to roll! For example, yesterday we were dealing with exponential functions. We had a whole class discussion of what exponential growth was (I use The Matrix as an example, when Agent Smith, the bad program, develops the power to copy himself, and we discuss how long it takes him to take over a world with 8 billion people in it). With some guidance on my part, we developed the function f(x)=1*2^x, and what all the parts of the function were. I expanded it to f(x)= initial value * (growth factor)^x. We worked through some examples of finding the parts of the function, the initial value and growth factor. ( f(x)=a*(1+r)^x )  Instead of the typical "give the students a couple of minutes, let the brave one give the answer and move on," way of trying to tell if the students get the answer, I sent out a quick poll. It is amazing that when there is an accountability on the screen showing how many people have or haven't answered, how fast the answers come in.  Every student had an answer, and we had a discussion about the answers, about every student's answers. There were about 3 misconceptions that came up that we were able to address immediately. Every student saw their answer on the screen, and I was able to give instantaneous feedback, and students got instantaneous feedback.  This is a form of formative assessment (FA), and I've used it a lot over the last couple of days. It is amazing how effective FA's are at clearing up misconceptions fast and moving the class forward. I was trying to use them before I left the classroom, but I don't think I fully "got it" then. I get it now. Granted, I have a great tool to use, the navigator, and not all the math teachers have them. There are other ways to get them going. More on that in the future.  I am rambling, too much coffee. I will discuss more of my views and experiences as we go through the summer.  Highlights: —I love the technology! —Formative Assessments are a huge key to moving a class forward. (and you don't need the tech to do it, you just need some creativity) —Get the students engaged, working, and hold them to it! —These students, who hate math, are showing improvement! —Give them hope that they can do it, give them tasks that they can succeed on, and build on that success.  ]]> Wormeli on Differentiation  06 Jan 2012 18:50:10 +0000John Foradori is an excellent source on Differentiated Instruction.

__label__0 Description  Number Theory is more than a comprehensive treatment of the subject. It is an introduction to topics in higher level mathematics, and unique in its scope; topics from analysis, modern algebra, and discrete mathematics are all included.  The book is divided into two parts. Part A covers key concepts of number theory and could serve as a first course on the subject. Part B delves into more advanced topics and an exploration of related mathematics. Part B contains, for example, complete proofs of the Hasse-Minkowski theorem and the prime number theorem, as well as self-contained accounts of the character theory of finite groups and the theory of elliptic functions.  The prerequisites for this self-contained text are elements from linear algebra. Valuable references for the reader are collected at the end of each chapter. It is suitable as an introduction to higher level mathematics for undergraduates, or for self-study.  From the reviews:  "This is a book which many mathematicians could enjoy browsing, and one which a good undergraduate could be encouraged to read to learn something of the interconnections, which exist between apparently disparate parts of mathematics."  --Canadian Mathematical Society  "As a source for information on the 'reach' of number theory into other areas of mathematics, it is an excellent work."Number Theory: An Introduction to Mathematics (.PDFNumber Theory: An Introduction to Mathematics (.PDFNumber Theory: An Introduction to Mathematics (.PDF

This can be done on a chalkboard, with a graphing calculator, or with a spreadsheet. Instructors often are careful to connect the symbolic and graphical (and occasionally the tabular) representations of the functions. However, the graphs that are typically used for this are static. The most recent versions of Microsoft Excel allow instructors to illustrate the connections between the symbolic, tabular, and graphical representations of the equations through quick generation of the function graphs. This requires only minimal input including three components: the equation of the function, its starting point, and the incremental changes between independent variable values. By formatting the spreadsheet to depend on these three things, the input values (and the calculated output values) are easily manipulated, allowing for changes in scale.}, msc2010 = {I20xx (U70xx)}, identifier = {2013b.00681}, }

__label__0 Continuing Education  Q: As a mathematical amateur no longer attending university, I miss the stimulation of taking a math course. If my interest were modern languages (for example), I could take what they call 'continuing education' courses at almost any college or university, but for the mathematical enthusiast these institutions seemingly have nothing. Can anybody suggest a comparable alternative?  A:Why does 'continuing education' not include (at least potentially) math? At one university I know (George Mason U.), they have a category called 'Extended Studies', open more-or-less to anyone paying the tuition, and it is certainly possible to take courses (including graduate-level) under that dispensation. There may be limits on how many you can take, etc., but it is routinely used by non-students who want to sample a course or two, for genuine 'continuing education', or as a way to help decide if they want to enroll in a degree program. (And if they do, the courses taken under Extended Studies count.) Not all colleges/universities are going to be that open, nor should they be. But many are. The kind of program that would be ideal for you is the Johns Hopkins Part-time Programs in Science/Engineering ( which has math courses (which I've taken.) You are probably not near the JH area (Baltimore/Washington), but I mention it to indicate that such programs do exist. These programs, like Mason, consciously cater to a broad professional audience, people already working in a field who would like to take a course here-and-there, or even work on an advanced degree in the evening. For that to be possible the university must be located in an area that has such a potential clientele, which generally means a large urban area. If you're not in such a locale, it may not be possible to find what you want. But if you are, and if there are several colleges around, I'd bet an aggressive search would turn up something. Supposedly, MIT has put all its courses online for free. (Which means the materials are out there, but not so much the instruction.) The trouble you run into is that there is not too much demand for an evening course or a satellite campus course in Abstract Algebra (although this does happen under some circumstances.) So it's hard to convince a dean to "waste" a faculty member on a course with an enrollment of 2.
__label__0 Product Description  A welcome addition to Saxon's curriculum line, Saxon Geometry is the perfect solution for students and parents who prefer a dedicated geometry course...yet want Saxon's proven methods!  Presented in the familiar Saxon approach of incremental development and continual review, topics are continually kept fresh in students' minds. Covering triangle congruence, postulates and theorems, surface area and volume, two-column proofs, vector addition, and slopes and equations of lines, Saxon features all the topics covered in a standard high school geometry course. Two-tone illustrations help students really "see" the geometric concepts, while sidebars provide additional notes, hints, and topics to think about. Parents will be able to easily help their students with the solutions manual, which includes step-by-step solutions to each problem in the student book; and quickly assess performance with the test book (test answers included). Tests are designed to be administered after every five lessons after the first ten.  Please Note: This is the third printing and errors to date have been corrected.  Product Reviews  Saxon Geometry Homeschool Kit 3.9 5 16 16  Poorly written textbook I have used Saxon for about 20 years so when they came out with a Geometry text I was pleased because this was lacking in the other texts. I've been highly disappointed. Number one, I was assured that I had the new solutions manual when I ordered but sadly there are many errors, as well as leaving out crucial steps in order to follow their solution. I have found solutions with concepts that have not even been taught. Number two, the text is just poorly written in general. The problem set questions are hard to understand what they are looking for. The explanations in the text are vague at best. I have had to rely on my engineering son to help me solve some problems for his youngest brother. This text does not hold up to the standard of the older textbooks. Don't buy it. You will be frustrated. April 10, 2013  It's Saxon, what else can you say My daughters were doing Switched on Schoolhouse Algebra. Both were lost. The combo of the DIVE videos and Teacher Videos did the trick. Saxon rocks. December 27, 2011  Great Item This is the second set of Saxon/Dive math sets we've had. My son learned Algebra II with the first and I highly recommend this product. The instructor does a terrific job of going over everything and the syllabus he provides with it takes the guess work out of the planning out a schedule for the whole school year. We use his time frame to plan all of my son's other leasons around. I hope he has one for Calculus. November 9, 2011  A very good value Geometry curriculum.

__label__0 Interactive Software Demos for Learning Differential Equations  Since the time of Isaac Newton, differential equations have been useful for modeling of a wide variety of dynamical physical systems. For example, the motion of a mass acted upon by a force can be modeled by a second-order differential equation using Newton's second law.  The objective of this project is to visualize solutions to basic differential equations used in various undergraduate courses on applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. The visualization is provided by real-time web-enabled software technologies. It is expected that the interactive software demos smooth out the student's learning curve and help instructors in lecturing the undergraduate courses.  Learning Goals: Classify critical points of the dynamical system and local stability of critical points. Match solutions of differential equations and trajectories on a phase plane of the system. Understand differences between finite and infinite trajectories on a phase plane. Identify the separatrix curves on the phase plane. Control behaviour of the system by changing initial values of the system. Understand the role of damping for motion of the pendulum.  Learning Goals: Understand hypotheses and constraints of mathematical modeling. Classify critical points of the dynamical system. Understand differences between local and global stability of critical points. Match population cycles of the predator-prey system and periodic solutions of the dynamical system.

__label__0 Classes are not aimed exclusively towards math competitions. Instead, IDEA Math is a program that can help students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in the long run. We have found that our program not only broadens and deepens the students' knowledge and skills in mathematics, but also help them develop perseverance and creativity that will benefit them in the long-run, regardless of their career paths.  I have taken IDEA MATH classes last year, will the classes be repeated for next year?  We have reorganized our series this year so that the majority of the material will be brand new. In future years, students could choose to move up from one series to another. Moreover, if a student chooses to be in a series for two years in a row, we will insert new problems and concepts into that series from year to year.  How am I (the student) evaluated? Are there any evaluation tests?  During each of the 6-week courses, there will be two 1 to 1.5 hour tests to check each student's progress. One test will be in the middle of the course, and the other will be at the end. The tests are intended as check points. They are not evaluations.  Since we focus on contest preparation, there will be various forms of mock contests. Scores/results will be kept only for the purpose of practicing, not for evaluation. We try to use these activities to stimulate students' interest and get them used to the contest atmosphere, instead of pressuring them through evaluation.  Who shall I meet at IDEA MATH?  Other capable students from the Massachusetts area who are passionate about mathematics. Many of our students have developed lasting friendships with their IDEA MATH peers, and many have learned a great deal from their peers as well as their instructors.  What is the difference between IDEA MATH and what I am learning in school?  The depth. At IDEA MATH, we do not focus on introducing students to higher math concepts, say Calculus. However, we go into much greater depth with topics covered in a middle/high school curriculum. For example, an eighth grade geometry math class may cover the triangle are formula of base times height divided by two, but our Math Roots Series will introduce students to three or four more important ways to calculate the same area. Students will see the connection between these different ways.  Can I sit in for a class?  Usually we do not allow sit-ins. However, we do encourage all prospective students to join us for the Open House.  Application  How do I apply?  You need do online registration first (creat your account), take the evaluation test, and then register course online.  Small Group and Private Lessons  Do you offer private lessons?  Yes. We offer lessons for all mathematical subjects, standardized tests and competitions for small groups and individuals.  How do I schedule a private or small group lesson?  Please call (603)686-1706 or email info@ideamath.org.  What is the rate of private and small group lesson?  The price varies by the subjects, levels and the group's size, with a range from $40 to $100 per hour per person. Please contact us for specifics.

__label__0 Few would argue that, through its development of science and technology, the human species has been more successful than any other in taking control of the environment and using the resources of the earth to its own advantage. It is probably equally clear that this dramatic development of science and technology is only possible because of our ability to think creatively, consistently and logically. Indeed, there seems to be a parallelism, a consistency, between the rules that govern logical thought and the rules that govern the functions of the physical universe. The physical universe is quite logical and consistent. It reveals its secrets to those who study it using creative, consistent and logical thought. And for the development of one's ability to exercise this very useful way of thinking there is probably no better approach than through the study of mathematics.  So welcome to the Department of Mathematics where you will have the opportunity to hone your thinking skills by taking some of our twenty four courses in algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus and differential equations. In addition to improving your ability to think clearly, you will also learn about many of the astounding mathematical discoveries that have been made throughout the centuries and how they can be used for practical applications in science, engineering, business and the health fields.  I encourage you to humbly and enthusiastically place yourself in the hands of our experienced and capable faculty who are fully devoted to teaching you mathematics. If you do this, you will be taken on an intellectual journey to fascinating places that you cannot easily imagine. You will come away not only well prepared with the technical knowledge you need for your chosen career or field of study, but with an enhanced ability to think more clearly, more deeply, more rigorously, more analytically and more precisely about yourself and everything you encounter. Welcome to the world of mathematics!

__label__0 A Look at Real-World Problem Solving 1.0 description  This paper (A LOOK AT REAL-WORLD PROBLEM SOLVING) presents an example of a real world problem that addresses several important points in the problem solving process. The example problem involves the trajectory of a projectile. The problem is to reach a desired point by selecting a launch angle. This problem has a wide variety of real applications: rocket and missile launching, targeting and intercepts, satellite orbit transfers and rendezvous, numerical optimization, polynomial root finding, and solving nonlinear equations. The mathematics needed to solve the problem are not too involved - only algebra and trigonometry. The process of solving the problem, however, is at times detailed and tedious. But, this is a concept that needs to be taught: real-world problems are not necessarily easy. Before looking at the solution, we will examine the real-world problem solving process.
__label__0 Synopsis  An accessible guide to developing intuition and skills for solving mathematical problems in the physical sciences and engineering  Equations play a central role in problem solving across various fields of study. Understanding what an equation means is an essential step toward forming an effective strategy to solve it, and it also lays the foundation for a more successful and fulfilling work experience. Thinking About Equations provides an accessible guide to developing an intuitive understanding of mathematical methods and, at the same time, presents a number of practical mathematical tools for successfully solving problems that arise in engineering and the physical sciences.  Equations form the basis for nearly all numerical solutions, and the authors illustrate how a firm understanding of problem solving can lead to improved strategies for computational approaches. Eight succinct chapters provide thorough topical coverage, including:  Approximation and estimation  Isolating important variables  Generalization and special cases  Dimensional analysis and scaling  Pictorial methods and graphical solutions  Symmetry to simplify equations  Each chapter contains a general discussion that is integrated with worked-out problems from various fields of study, including physics, engineering, applied mathematics, and physical chemistry. These examples illustrate the mathematical concepts and techniques that are frequently encountered when solving problems. To accelerate learning, the worked example problems are grouped by the equation-related concepts that they illustrate as opposed to subfields within science and mathematics, as in conventional treatments. In addition, each problem is accompanied by a comprehensive solution, explanation, and commentary, and numerous exercises at the end of each chapter provide an opportunity to test comprehension.  Requiring only a working knowledge of basic calculus and introductory physics, Thinking About Equations is an excellent supplement for courses in engineering and the physical sciences at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and educators in all branches of engineering, physics, chemistry, biophysics, and other related fields who encounter mathematical problems in their day-to-day

__label__0 Mathematics Requirements by Major  This information is designed to help students who participate in the Early Mathematics Placement Tool (EMPT) program for high school juniors to interpret and assess their test scores in relation to requirements at University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Technical College System campuses.  The score report, which each student receives, indicates the level at which the student would likely start, if he or she were to take a mathematics course right now, at one of the University of Wisconsin System or Wisconsin Technical College System campuses. The descriprions of the levels are provided for each odd number scale point. Students placing at an even numbered scale point have skills that fall between those provided for the points immediately above and below it.  A broad description of the Early Mathematics Placement Tool levels appears below. How the levels are defined in terms of actual courses may vary from campus to campus and can be found in the beginning course sequence chart for each campus.  The campus specific information also outlines the minimum mathematics requirements for specific college majors. Students can find out what mathematics course they are prepared for at this time and how many more mathematics courses they would need to fulfill requirements of a particular institution or major program.  With this information, students will have a chance to improve their mathematics preparation in high school by taking an appropriate mathematics course in their senior year. A mathematics teacher or counselor can assist students in interpreting the EMPT results as related to students' college aspirations and suggest an appropriate mathematics course to bridge any gaps in their mathematics preparation. Even if students are right on track in their mathematics preparation, they should enroll in a mathematics class in their senior year, because mathematics skills tend to become rusty if not continuously practiced.  Adequate mathematics preparation prior to entering college saves a student both time and money. A student taking high school level courses at college must pay tuition, but does not receive credits which count towards a college degree. Such a student thereby extends the time it takes to finish college with a degree.  Please note that both mathematics curricula and majors requirements are continually reviewed by campuses and thus the information contained in this booklet is fluid. Students should always check with their intended campus prior to enrolling for the most up-to-date information.  The UW System Mathematics Placement Test is required of students entering a UW institution. It is similar to the EMPT but somewhat longer. Hopefully, for students taking a college preparatory mathematics course in their senior year, the UW Mathematics Placement Test scores will be higher than the EMPT scores. But they could turn out lower if students do not take such a mathematics course.  Description of Early Mathematics Placement Tool Levels  Level 1  Students at Level 1 have a weakness in basic mathematics skills and need to commit to a great deal of preparation in order to be ready for college-level mathematics. If preparation is not undertaken in high school, the student will start the college mathematics course sequence at the lowest level and will pay for mathematics courses which do not count toward his/her degree.  Level 2  Level 3  Students at Level 3 demonstrate skills in basic mathematics, but have weaknesses in algebra. Students at this level need to commit to further algebra preparation in order to be ready for college-level mathematics. If preparation is not undertaken in high school, the student will most likely start the college mathematics course sequence at a low level and will pay for mathematics courses which will not count toward his/her degree.  Level 4  Level 5  Students at Level 5 have basic algebra skills and are usually ready for a college algebra course. Further strengthening of these skills is usually required for most college and university programs.  Level 6  Level 7  Students at Level 7 have the algebra skills to take courses at the pre-calculus level, but need to develop better algebra and trigonometry skills to take calculus.  Level 8  Level 9  Students at Level 9 have the skills required for the calculus sequence.

__label__0 Course 4 Unit 7 - Functions and Symbolic Reasoning 1st Edition  In Course 4, the mathematical strands in the Contemporary Mathematics in Context program become increasingly blended within units. The content of this unit is from both the algebra and functions strand and the geometry and trigonometry strand. (See the descriptions of Course 4 Units.)  Unit Overview  Functions and Symbolic Reasoning extends student ability to manipulate symbolic representations of exponential, common and natural logarithmic, and trigonometric functions and to solve exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric equations. Trigonometric identities are developed and proved or disproved. Geometric representations of complex numbers are used to reason about and to find roots of complex numbers.  Unit Objectives  To use properties of exponents to transform exponential expressions into equivalent exponential expressions  To solve exponential equations  To use relationships between logarithms and exponentials to write logarithmic equations in forms without logarithms  To know and be able to use the definitions of the six trigonometric functions of angles in standard position  To know and be able to use the fundamental trigonometric identities  To prove a statement of equality is an identity  To solve trigonometric equations  To represent complex numbers geometrically  To interpret multiplication of complex numbers geometrically  To use DeMoivre's Theorem to find all the roots of a complex number  Sample Overview  There are two different samples from Functions and Symbolic Reasoning. The first sample consists of Investigations 1 and 2 from Lesson 2, "Reasoning with Trigonometric Functions." These investigations introduce the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions and begin work with trigonometric identities.  The second sample is the "Looking Back" lesson for this unit. This lesson is intended to provide students with tasks that will encourage them to look back at the unit as a whole. Students review, synthesize, and apply the knowledge gained during the study of the unit.  Instructional Design  Throughout the curriculum, interesting problem contexts serve as the foundation for instruction. As lessons unfold around these problem situations, classroom instruction tends to follow a common pattern as elaborated under Instructional Design.  Contact Adobe with any technical questions about their software or its installation.  How the Algebra and Functions Strand Continues  Algebraic representations of surfaces and conic sections are introduced in Unit 8, Space Geometry. A unit from the algebra and functions strand that develops understanding and skill in the use of standard spreadsheet operations while reviewing and extending many of the basic algebra topics from Courses 1-3 is recommended for students intending to pursue college programs in social, management, and some of the health sciences or humanities.
__label__0 A book on basic math that explains how math really works  A book on basic math that explains how math really works  Please, recommend me a book (or books) on basic math/pre-algebra that really explains how math works from the inside out. What I mean by that is a book that goes really deeply into exploring math giving you true understanding of what's going on behind the scenes so to speak. For example, why the long division method even works, why when dividing one fraction by another fraction is supposed to be carried out the way it is, why dividing by zero doesn't really make much sense, why a negative number multiplied by another negative number gives a positive number and stuff like that. So a book that gives the basis for basic math and arithmetics. Not like the books which only explain how to superficially perform math operations and algorithms. I looked into the for dummies series, but they are all like that, don't provide you with that kind of explanation.  I don't really think that such a book exists. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of books that explain exactly what you want. A lot of books explain how the long division works, how multiplication of fractions works, why multiplication of negative numbers result in a positive number. The problem is that such a book is usually quite advanced. The subject that treats such questions is abstract algebra, and it's a college-level math course.  Furthermore, if you want everything to be explained, then you will need to deal with proofs. So before reading abstract algebra, you should read up on mathematical proofs.  If you wish to try out abstract algebra, then I can recommend the book "A first course in Algebra" by Fraleigh. Everybody who is familiar with proofs will be able to tackle this book. But it will still be a difficult read. If you want to do proofs and sets first, then Velleman's "how to prove it" is a good read.  I realize that I have not been helpful at all. As I understood your questions, you wanted easy books that explain everything. I have given you hard books. The problem is that there are no easy books that explain it all (as far as I'm aware). I think your best bet is posting the questions you have on the forums here. That way you won't have to read an entire book.  Algebra by Gelfand is well motivated and fairly rigorous (at least for high school algebra standards). Lectures on Elementary Mathematics by Lagrange also seems to be like something you are looking for (you may find it online here).  Most arithmetic algorithmic (e.g. long/synthetic division, multiplication with multi-digit numbers, &c.), however, are things that you should easily be able to justify on your own if you know a bit of algebra.  If you want to find out how mathematics is done, I'd recommend watching Vi Hart's Youtube channel and reading Hilbert's Geometry and Imagination.  MacLane? Really? That may be too advanced, don't you think? The OP asks for a book on basic math/pre-algebra!  Well, I've read just the beginning, but it seems any person could understand a lot of this book. Look at wiki entry. I guess at least first part of the book is readable by anyone. It definitely is "behind the scenes" book. But yeah, this is perhaps too much philosophy, it seems the OP is looking for something more practical.  I think it to a large degree is a matter of psychological satisfaction, which can vary between individuals; some people ask the question "Why?" more often than others. Eventually, you'll hit a wall where you feel satisfied with the mathematical theory "behind" things. Personally, I'm using "Basic Mathematics" by Serge Lang as complementary studying in high school right now, and I think it's enough for me. However, it's probably not for you because it assumes some things without proof, like distributivity, associativity and commutativity. I, on the other hand, think it's OK to do so since I think I have a sufficient intuitive understanding why those properties must be true.  I would suggest that you look into the above mentioned books and see if something fits you. Good luck!

__label__0 The study of Mathematics has been a fundamental part of education since ancient times and has lost none of its relevance in modern times. In fact, much the contrary. Mathematics permeates our lives, enables us to communicate across vast distances, shrinks our technology to the palm of our hands, and opens up more and more of the nature of the world to our investigations.  We understand full well that many of our students come to use with little of this sense of wonder, rather with a sense of fear and apprehension.  We strive constantly to meet our students where they are, bring them into a new relationship with mathematics, and open up the possibilities of mathematics for them and for their careers.  Math  Curriculum  The Mathematics department curriculum has two components, one developmental, the other college-level.  The Developmental Mathematics Program  For those that are not ready to undertake college-level mathematics, either because they have been away from the subject for a while or because they have yet to fully grasp the fundamentals and put them into practice, the developmental mathematics program provides coursework for students demonstrating deficiencies in mathematical skills. MATH 049, Elementary Algebra, and MATH 149, Intermediate Algebra are consecutive 3-unit courses that prepare students for college-level work in mathematics. We also offer a self-paced version of Intermediate Algebra (MATH 1491) for those who fall somewhere in-between these two traditional courses. Placement in these classes is based on a proficiency examination score. A grade of "C" (2.0) or higher in MATH 049 is required to enroll in MATH 149. A grade of "C" (2.0) or higher in MATH 149 or 1491 is required to enroll in college level mathematics courses.  The College-Level Mathematics Program  All university students are required to complete at least one college-level mathematics course. Many departments ask for an additional mathematics course, so please check your major department's course requirements. College-level mathematics courses are designated with a number in the 200s, such as Business Math and Statistics, College Algebra and Trigonometry with Descriptive Geometry. In addition, the department may occasionally offer lower- or upper-division topics courses in mathematics.

__label__0 ACCELERATED PRE-CALCULUS SUMMER STUDY GUIDE  CHAPTER 12: SETS, RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS  A "set" is a collection of "objects." Each object in the set is called an "element of the set." The elements usually have something in common.  For example, the following, {monkey, bear, lion, giraffe, zebra}, is called a set of elements. What do these elements have in common? One answer might be that they are animals in a local zoo.  Notice the symbols "{" and "}". We will call theses symbols "set enclosures.""{" is the "left set enclosure" and "}" is the "right set enclosure."  The following set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...} is a collection of objects that are numbers. The elements are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and what these elements have in common is that they are positive even numbers. Notice that the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...} has 3 periods after the number 10. These three periods, called "ellipsis," mean "and so forth" or suggest that the elements in a set continue on forever or as mathematicians say "continue on to infinity."  When we need to represent some "recognizable pattern" mathematicans often use ellipsis. Consider the following set: {3, 6, 9,..., 90, 93, 96}. I have left out many numbers from this set but the ellipses suggest I am incrementing each subsequent number by 3 and the set contains all the numbers incremented by 3, starting at 3, going to the number 96.  Can you see the pattern in the following? {...1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...} If you take any number in this set and multiply it by 2 you will get the next number in the set. Pattern recognition skills are very important in the world of mathematics!  SECTION 12.2: DOMAIN, RANGE, RELATION  Let's look at this set: { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } This is a set of ordered pairs which can be used to represent points in the Cartesian Coordinate System. The points below can be represented by our set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }.  The set of x-values of a set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is named the "domain." The domain in this instance is {-2, 1, -1, 5}.  The set of y-values of a set of ordered pairs is named the "range." The range in this instance is {4, 3, -2, -3}.  The set of ordered pairs is also named a "relation." So { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is a relation.  ans: The domain is {5, 4, 3, 6} and the range is {–3, 6, –1, 3} Comment: Notice that the x coordinate, 5, occurs twice in {(5, –3), (4, 6), (3, –1), (6, 6), (5, 3)}. Mathematicians have agreed to write an x value in the domain once even though it may occur more than once in the relation. The same goes for the range: notice the y coordinate 6 occurs twice in the relation but is written only once in the range.  There is a very special "relation" called a "function." Functions are very powerful in the world of applications as we will see in Chapter 16 of this manual.  WHAT IS A FUNCTION?  If each x-value of a relation has one unique y-value assigned to it, then the relation is named a "function."  ex. 1) { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function! Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. Note the ordered pairs in blue. The x-value 1 has two different y-values, 3 and 5. Hence, we say { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function.  ex. 2) { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is called a function. Why? Because each x-value has only 1 y value.  ex. 3) { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function. Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. The x-value -7 has three different y-values 5,4,and -2. Hence, we say { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function.  ex. 4) { (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) } is a function. Why? Because each unique x-value has only 1 y-value.  COMMENT: All functions are relations but not all relations are functions. Remember, a relation is nothing more than a set of ordered pairs.  12.4 GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS VERSES NON-FUNCTIONS  A set of ordered pairs that is a function will have more than one point falling on a vertical line. Let's compare the graph of a function to a graph of a non function.  FUNCTION  NOT A FUNCTION  { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }  { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }  FUNCTION  NOT A FUNCTION  { (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) }  { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) }  We will be looking at functions in greater depth in chapter 16. This was a brief introduction.

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word "algebra" broadly, defining it as a "method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is "the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

__label__0 CalcPlot3D, an Exploration Environment for Multivariable Calculus  Using CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus  One way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures. I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.  An even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using "What if…" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to "play" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and "play" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]  Below is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments. Before giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board. Once students have seen one example using the applet, most have little trouble completing the exercise on their own.  Without further discussion, let's look at some examples of how this can be done! As you develop your own examples, please send them along to me! I would love to develop a library of useful ways to use this applet.

(December 10, 2008)  3. When you are asked to compute a derivative on a quiz, you do not need to simplify your work unless it is stated otherwise.  2. I should have placed more emphasis on one particular point in my classes. Many of the limit laws I was using in class, such as distributing a limit between the sum or difference of two functions, only works when the limit of both functions exist independently. See Section 1.3 in the textbook for more details. Also, I am including an example from the homework (also listed above) of when the limit of two functions that do not exist add to make a functions where the limit of the function exists.  1. The definition of one-to-one on page 30 (section 0.3) given in the textbook is NOT the definition generally accepted in mathematics literature. The accepted definition can be realized by replacing "exactly one" with "at most one" in the definition. With respect to quiz papers, if the student uses either of these definitions correctly, no deductions will be taken with respect to this particular concept.

__label__0 Abstract  A not-insignificant number of undergraduate engineers have problems with mathematics. School mathematics often has to be reinforced during undergraduate studies, where a lack of understanding at the lower level often impedes learning at the higher level. Here, visualisations can help - either by contextualising the mathematics, or by using graphical visualisations. In this latter case, "A picture is worth a thousand words" is most appropriate. However, even students who have problems rearranging equations are almost invariably able to "read", understand and draw graphs - basically visualisations of mathematical equations, be they as simple as the straight-line equation or as complicated as the solution of a second-order partial differential equation. Consequently, displaying graphs (i.e. visualising) can help deepen insight into mathematical processes. This, in turn, can raise a student's mathematical proficiency, predilection, awareness and eventual achievement. This paper deals with, amongst others, the following questions. Does using MathinSite improve mathematical achievement and if so, how? How does using MathinSite score over other computer-based learning techniques?
__label__0 Summary of Content: The success of applied mathematics in describing the world around us arises from the use of mathematical models, often using ordinary and partial differential equations. This module continues the development of such models, building on the modules G11CAL and G11APP. It introduces techniques for studying linear and nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, using linearisation and phase planes. Partial differential equation models are introduced and analysed. These are used to describe the flow of heat, the motion of waves and traffic flow. Continuum models are introduced to describe the flow of fluids (liquids and gases, such as the oceans or the Earth's atmosphere).

__label__0 MAA Review  [Reviewed by Mark Hunacek, on 09/06/2012]  A student learning special relativity for the first time must contend not only with counter-intuitive concepts such as time dilation and length contraction but also with fairly cumbersome equations such as the Lorentz equations  x' = γ (x – vt)  t' = γ (t – (v/c2)x)  (where γ = 1/√(1-v2/c2) and c is the speed of light), which relate the position and time of an observer O at rest and a moving observer O'. The novel idea of this slim, succinct book is to seek to replace reliance on these equations with geometric reasoning. Of course the "geometry" here is not the ordinary Euclidean geometry we all learned in high school, and which is based on circles in the sense that the set of all points at distance 1 from the origin is a circle. Here, instead, the geometry is based on hyperbolas: the squared distance of a point (x, y) from the origin is defined to be x2 – y2, so the "unit circle" in this geometry is really a hyperbola. The ordinary trigonometric functions are then replaced by the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh, applied to angles that show up in spacetime diagrams. (Such a diagram plots the position x and time t of an object, with t running up the vertical axis and x moving along the horizontal one; thus, for example, a vertical line depicts an object that stays motionless as time passes.)  The book starts with two introductory chapters, the first of which (very) rapidly contrasts Newton's and Einstein's physics and the second of which functions as a quick overview of the physics of special relativity, including the derivation of the Lorentz equations from the two basic postulates of special relativity (that the laws of physics apply in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers). This is followed by two chapters on Euclidean "circle geometry" and the non-Euclidean "hyperbola geometry" that will be used throughout the book, introducing the hyperbolic trigonometric functions from several different (but equivalent) points of view.  The geometry of special relativity begins in earnest with the next chapter, which introduces spacetime diagrams and a particular angle in them called the rapidity, which turns out to be the angle between a worldline and the vertical (ct) axis (ct, rather than t, because we want to measure time and space in the same units). The ideas developed here are exploited in two subsequent chapters ("Applications" and "Paradoxes") which discuss the geometric ideas behind such topics as length contraction, time dilation, the twins paradox, and others.  There are then three (non-consecutive) chapters that struck me as the most demanding in the book: chapter 9, on relativistic mechanics, addresses the relationship between mass and energy and gives insight into the famous equation E = mc2; chapter 11, on relativistic electromagnetism (which, thanks to my dismal background in physics, I only dimly understood) unifies electricity and magnetism; chapter 13 provides a warp-speed look at general relativity.  The book concludes with two chapters that are really just straight mathematics, no physics: one chapter ("Hyperbolic Geometry") discusses various models for hyperbolic geometry, and the other ("Calculus") offers a geometric derivation of the trigonometric and exponential functions.  There are thirteen substantial worked-out examples in the book, all of which struck me as both interesting and illuminating; instead of scattering them throughout the text the author puts them all in three chapters (7, 10 and 12) devoted entirely to them. There are no exercises, but the author does occasionally explicitly leave something to the reader to ponder, such as the resolution of the "manhole cover" paradox in chapter 8.  Despite the fact that there are at least two other books (one quite recent) with titles that are very similar to this book's, Dray's approach really does appear to be novel. Dragon's new book The Geometry of Special Relativity: A Concise Course, for example, seems (based on an admittedly cursory glance) to be addressed to a considerably more sophisticated audience than is this text, and while geometric ideas are certainly mentioned the ones that are discussed in Dray do not appear to take center stage in Dragon. There is also a book by Callahan with the similar-sounding title The Geometry of Spacetime, but that book is considerably different than this one; unlike this text, it covers both general and special relativity (so "geometry" as used in the title of that book really refers to differential geometry, which finds extensive use) and the discussion of special relativity in the first half of the book emphasizes linear algebra notation; matrix computations appear throughout. This is consistent with a primary idea in Dray's book (that the Lorentz transformation is really just a hyperbolic rotation) but the manner of presentation is different. (Anybody planning to look at both books should also note that Callahan, in contravention of what I believe is now standard practice, uses the horizontal, rather than vertical, axis for time.) Finally, I should perhaps mention Taylor and Wheeler's Spacetime Physics, endorsed by the author but unseen by me, which apparently contained a lot of this material in its first edition but left much out of it out of the second.  The question then arises, of course, whether "novel" necessarily means "better". I found that the geometric discussions did shed some light on the underlying ideas, but I also thought at times that the calculations used in them were just disguised versions of the calculations used from a more traditional approach (which, I think, any serious student of special relativity should be familiar with, since these ideas appear so frequently in the literature). So, while I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned from it, I tend to think that it would serve best as a supplemental text for a course in special relativity rather than as a main text. (The very succinct writing style, and the total lack of homework exercises, also influenced this opinion.) The author himself may think this, because he writes in the preface that the book "is not intended as a replacement for any of the excellent textbooks on special relativity" but is intended as an introduction "to a particularly beautiful way of looking at special relativity… encouraging students to see beyond the formulas to the deeper structure." This goal, I think, has been met: on more than one occasion as I read this book I found myself looking at other texts to compare discussions, and I generally found that the process seemed to have a synergistic effect: I got more out of both books by doing this. This is unquestionably a book that anybody who teaches special relativity will want to look at.

__label__0 Hi. I am right now doing the Arithmetic book and I am can tell that I am really having a hard time. Can anyone make a recommendation? I just don't get the problems and feel like I need alot of practice on just basics.  Have you worked through the Math Essentials book ("Book Zero") yet? You'll find that a lot of the more fundamental math concepts are covered in detail in that book. To a certain extent, the other quant books assume that you're comfortable with those basics and then add on complexity to make the topics more like what you'll see on the actual GMAT
__label__0 In answer to your other questions  >>Anyways, must I learn the analytic geometry if I just want to make simple programs that resemble something of 3d, but maybe not 100% accurate?  No, you can write very simple programs without understanding the maths. But that's all you'll be able to do. If you learn a little more, you'll be able to go much further. And you'll be able to make more sense of the maths on Wikipedia.  >>They don't teach any useful math at school and they aren't any time soon so I don't know where to start learning  Don't forget that it's more important to a teacher that the dull students aren't left behind, than the bright students get ahead. Maybe you can find a teacher who is willing to explain something to you outside of class. Or maybe a parent or relative of yours could help.  At my school there was a maths society where we explored topics outside of the curriculum...  Having a good teacher is probably the best way to learn this sort of stuff, but failing that a good book might be helpful. Check your library for something that's at the right level for you.  >>And I don't what this type of stuff means:  >>sin^2 (x) <<????  Basically, computer programmers need to make sure the computer understands them. Mathematicians need to make sure that other mathematicians understand them. So while programming languages tend to be fairly simple and consistent, mathematical notation is much less so.  Also remember that mathematics until recently was nearly always written by hand, and even today much is written by hand. A notation that's easier to read in slightly messy writing is a winner.  There are many areas of mathematics where there are a few different notations in popular usage. Often say Europe will use one notation and the US will use another.  Anyway, this is one case where "everybody knows" that sin^2(x) means sin(x)*sin(x). Just learn it.  >>$variable = new variabletype();  This is to do with object oriented programming, a big topic that I don't think you should worry about just yet. PHP does not require you to use it.
__label__0 The Grading System: Instructor Notes  The grading scheme from the student guide is reproduced below. There are three components to the student's grade. As the instructor, you are responsible for the determining the section component and how you will use it to adjust the student's final course grade.  Evaluating the section component. Since we consider cooperative learning to be an essential feature of the introductory program, we require that team homework count for at least 40% of the section component. Aside from that, it is up to you how to determine the section component of the grade. For example, you may choose to give weekly individual or group quizzes and/or daily reading quizzes; you may choose to collect individual homework; you may choose to give credit for in-class work, presentations, extra credit, good team evaluations, etc. It helps to choose a system that encourages study habits that you believe will contribute to student learning.  Informing the students. It is important that you explain your system for evaluating the section component clearly and carefully in your first day handout so that your students know how they will be evaluated. It is also important to ensure that the feedback you give students on their section work accurately reflects the impact it will have on their grade. There are many simple ways to achieve this. One is to grade section work with a median of approximately 70%. If that does not suit your class, or your grading, an alternative is to announce the median score each time you return graded work.  The Grading System: Reproduced from the Student Guide  Grades in this math course. All sections of this course use the same grading guidelines to standardize the evaluation process. Your final letter grade in the course will be based on three components:  The uniform component.  The section component.  The gateway component.  Your uniform component will determine your baseline letter grade for the course. Your baseline grade will be adjusted by the section and gateway components as described below to determine your course letter grade.  1. The uniform component. There are two uniform midterm exams and a uniform final exam. Each of these exams will be taken by all students in all sections at the same time, and are graded by all the instructors working together. Your uniform component score will be determined from your scores on each exam as follows:  Midterm Exam 1  25% of uniform component score  Midterm Exam 2  35% of uniform component score  Final Exam  40% of uniform component score  After each exam, a letter grade will be assigned to your uniform component score using a scale determined by the course director specifically for that exam. We do not use the "10-point scale" often seen in high school courses in which scores in the 90's get an A, in the 80's get a B, and so forth; the level of difficulty of the exams will be considered. The scale for the uniform component score will apply to all students in all sections.  2. The section component. To help you learn the material, you will be given a variety of reading assignments, team homework, individual homework, quizzes and other in-class activities. Your instructor will decide how the section component is determined for your particular section and grade the section work to determine your section score. The section component has the potential to increase your final grade above the baseline grade by one third of a letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to an A-, etc.); and, assuming that the assigned work is completed, this component cannot lower your final grade below the baseline grade by more than one third of a letter grade. So, if you are keeping up with the course and doing well in your section work, it will not only help you to do well in the uniform exams, but may also add to your baseline grade. Similarly, if you fall behind in your section work, it may reduce your baseline grade.  3. The gateway component. There will be one or two (depending on the course you are taking) online basic skills gateway test(s) which you need to pass by the deadline announced in the course schedule. These routine tests are repeatable, and in general do not pose a problem for students who are keeping up with the course work. You may practice each test online as many times as you like, and you may take a test for a score as often as twice per day until the deadline. The gateway tests do not have the potential to raise your baseline grade, but if they are not passed by the deadline, the gateway component will automatically reduce your final grade in the course. Deadlines and grade penalties will be announced in your class. All sections of your course have the same deadlines and penalties assigned to the gateway component.  Section averages. Course policy is that a section's average final letter grade cannot differ too much from that section's average baseline letter grades. This means that the better your entire section does on the uniform exams, the higher average letter grade your instructor can assign in your section. It is therefore in your best interest to help your fellow students in your section do well in this course. In other words, cooperation counts!  Grades at the university. Many students who come to the University of Michigan have to adjust themselves to college grading standards. The mean high school grade point average (recalculated using only strictly academic classes) of our entering students is around 3.6, so many of you were accustomed to getting "straight A's" in high school. Students' first reaction to college grades is often, "I've never gotten grades like these." However, a grade of 15/20 on a team homework assignment (which you might previously have converted to 75% - a high school C) may well be a good score in a college math course. Your own instructor is your best source of information on your progress in the class.  Describing the grading system to students. You should state explicitly how you plan to arrive at semester grades - what exams will be given, approximately what weight they will have in the overall assessment of the student's work, how team homework is counted, how much quizzes will count, etc. The in-class component of the grade can be based on quiz scores, individual homework, class participation, or whatever you find appropriate. It is important to not to assign letter grades to the in-class component of the grade because the grades you award at the end of the term will have to be in alignment with the performance of your class on the uniform exams.  Assigning final semester grades. The procedure for calculating semester grades will be discussed in course meetings as the term progresses.  Grade books and records. Keep a good, clear record of your grades in a secure place. Don't lose it. Record all scores which will count towards students' grades. Many grades complaints can be prevented by keeping accurate records. It's easy to forget to record grades before returning papers, so record everything, including all grade changes, immediately. Students are very serious about their grades and expect them to be treated as a strictly private matter. You do not need to keep a record of students' attendance unless you choose to, however, you may want to note any extended absences.  Complaints about your grading. From the point of view of University of Michigan students, a great deal hinges on getting the high grades they are accustomed to getting in high school. Many first term freshman have never had a grade lower than an A! They will often argue persistently over one or two points. This is not a sign that they don't respect you. Of course, you should treat all student complaints about grading mistakes or unfairness in a serious manner.

__label__0 Modern Methods in Combinatorics  Objectives :  For a long time, Combinatorics was considered mainly as recreational mathematics. But in the past few decades, it has emerged as a mainstream area, with rich connections with more classical ones such as algebra, topology, geometry and probability theory. Moreover, because of its close links with computer science, Combinatorics has become a crucial scientific endeavor.  Besides classical tools, like the pigeonhole principle, the inclusion-exclusion principle, the double counting argument, induction, Ramsey argument, etc., some recent tools (the probabilistic, the algebraic, the linear algebra, the analytical and the topological methods) have shown their surprising power in solving a lot of combinatorial problems (classical and new ones). For example, with a mere knowledge of the concepts of linear independence and discrete probability, beautiful connections can be made between algebra, probability, and combinatorics. These new techniques have also found striking applications in other areas of discrete mathematics and the theory of computing.  Despite the beauty, the breadth and depth of results and applications of Combinatorics, research and teaching in this field are underrepresented in Argentina and South America. One of the main purposes of this school is to change this situation, by bringing a "guided tour" covering its most important branches, and by demonstrating its methods and power. Another related objective is the creation of research and academic networks and to build a frame for the interchange of ideas in this field.

__label__0 Preface -- Vector analysis, which had its beginnings in the middle of the 19th century, has in recent years, become an essential part of the mathematical background required of engineers, physicists, mathematicians and other scientists. This requirement is far from accidental, for not only does vector analysis provide a concise notation for presenting equations arising from mathematical formulations of physical and geometrical problems, but it is also a natural aid in forming mental pictures of physical and geometrical ideas. In short, it might very well be considered a most rewarding language and mode of thought for the physical sciences. .  This Schaum's Outline gives you  . . Practice problems with full explanations that reinforce knowledge. Coverage of the most up-to-date developments in your course field. In-depth review of practices and applications. .

__label__0 Description  This is a book on Euclidean geometry that covers the standard material in a completely new way, while also introducing a number of new topics that would be suitable as a junior-senior level undergraduate textbook. The author does not begin in the traditional manner with abstract geometric axioms. Instead, he assumes the real numbers, and begins his treatment by introducing such modern concepts as a metric space, vector space notation, and groups, and thus lays a rigorous basis for geometry while at the same time giving the student tools that will be useful in otherPlane and Solid Geometry (Universitext
__label__0 It always shocks me to see high school students struggling to solve simple arithmetic problems. I happened to casually glance at the algebra homework of a ninth grader one day and saw "3×7 =" written next to a graphing question. Evidently, he did not immediately know the answer and was probably looking for a calculator. I later learned that this student was almost failing the algebra course, but I also could not help but wonder how much trouble the actually failing students were having. It simply seemed inefficient to me that these students were trying tolearn high school math, which is best learned with a solid foundation of fundamental concepts,when they couldn't remember the math they were supposed to have mastered six years ago.  The United States is one of the world's most technologically advanced countries, yet our mathematics program, especially at the secondary level, lags behind those of other industrialized countries [1][2]. Without a solid math background from grade school, the majority of adults in the US lack basic number sense skills – according to a poll conducted by the Center for Economic and Entrepreneurial Literacy almost 80% of adults interviewed did not understand the magnitude of a trillion [3]. These people may not completely understand the true size of the US's national debt or deficit, since for them, the figures may just seem like any big number.  Given American students' poor performance in math compared to other countries, it is unsurprising to find that the US tried a series math reforms throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Until 1960's, the predominant way of teaching math, often known as the "traditional" approach, emphasized memorization of basic facts and standard algorithms at the elementary level, followed by an endless array of exercises to reinforce the information. The rote memorization mindset continued through high school, and even into college; it was not uncommon to see a college calculus class that mainly focused on integration formulas and differentiation rules rather than on the fundamental meaning and purpose of derivatives and integrals [4]. Textbooks presented few problems that went beyond substituting into given algorithms, and teachers rarely explained or even mentioned the reasons and principles behind these algorithms. Consequently, math often appeared as a random collection of formulas to students. Critics have called this traditional method "parrot math" to stress that while students  eventually could reproduce most of the basic skills they were taught, they lacked any in-depth understanding of what they were learning [5].  In the 1960's, a radical change in the curriculum occurred in the US as a response to the Sputnik crisis, which spawned the Space Race against the Soviet Union. There was a general fear that the "traditional" math curriculum was not adequate to produce engineers that were well- grounded in advanced math. The National Science Foundation thus proposed "new math", which required students to learn abstract math concepts as early as elementary school, often before mastering basic computational skills. Set theory and abstract algebra, which were typically topics studied by advanced math undergraduates, made appearances in elementary school textbooks. Educators justified these new curriculum additions by claiming that students would grasp abstract math more easily in higher education if they were exposed to it earlier, although they did not make any explicit provisions for students who did not intend to further study science or engineering after high school [6].  Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult for students to process the abstract concepts, especially since they had very little concrete math background to build upon. For example, without a clear understanding of basic addition facts, ideas such as the Commutative Property of Addition seemed strange and unnecessary to students. According to Piaget's theory from developmental psychology, children generally do not develop the ability to perform abstract reasoning until adolescence, so the "new math" essentially tried to teach concepts that most children were not cognitively ready to learn [7].  As in the traditional approach, students had weak math foundations because they did not completely understand the ideas of the "new math". However, the new approach was even less effective in the long-run because abstract mathematical concepts had no common applications in the real world, whereas traditional arithmetic operations were at least used in day-to-day tasks. Furthermore, the teachers themselves often did not completely grasp what they taught since they were generally not exposed to abstract mathematics in secondary school, so explaining the concepts to elementary school children was nearly impossible. Students often came out of elementary school having a vague idea about technical advanced math terminology but without the ability to compute basic multiplication facts. Ultimately, the experiment was a failure, and most schools almost immediately switched back to the traditional approach in the 1970's [6].  The traditional approach continued to be the method of choice in schools across the US for another twenty years, and before long, arguments about students' shallow understanding of math formulas again emerged. A new movement came into focus in the late 1980's when the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) introduced a different set of standards that emphasized mathematical inquiry over routine calculations. Memorization of algorithms was nearly eliminated, calculators were encouraged, and students were asked to "discover" their own methods of doing basic operations. This "constructivist" proposal gave rise to many new textbooks in the 1990's, and it became popular as several large school districts adopted these new curriculum reforms [8].  Unfortunately, students and teachers were shortly faced with a new problem. To make the curriculum seem more modern, many programs encouraged heavy calculator use and did not require students to memorize basic facts. However, without adequate practice in these essential  computational skills, students began to have trouble with even basic arithmetic, and were rarely able to do even slightly complicated problems without technology. Also, without a methodical way to add fractions, multiply two-digit numbers together, convert between percents and decimals, or carry out other similar operations, students usually ended elementary school mathematics unable to perform these essential operations. Visualizing two fractions being added, for example, was preferred over more algorithmic approaches but only works practically for simple cases; with a problem like 2/13 + 5/16, intuition quickly breaks down and one must use more general methods [9]. While calculators have made tedious arithmetic unnecessary, basic computations show up frequently in numerous subjects that students may pursue later on, and in any case, it would be highly inconvenient for people to rely on a calculator for calculations that could be quickly done mentally with adequate practice.  Furthermore, perhaps as an attempt to avoid traditional methods, books commonly used variants of the standard algorithms for operations such as multiplication, division, and fraction addition. Besides being usually longer and more time-consuming, these "new" algorithms also misunderstood the NCTM reform's main objective: the goal was to help students understand math by finding alternatives to the traditional approach, not to replace existing algorithms. Incorporating an antiquated, inefficient "lattice" system for multiplying instead of the standard algorithm, for example, neither sped up the computation nor helped the student understand multiplication [10].  With all these unsuccessful changes in math programs over the past 50 years, it is not surprising that American students are behind their international counterparts in mathematics. But we rarely think about why students from other countries can learn math more thoroughly. A  lengthy study done by Ginsberg and colleagues followed the math education system in Singapore, which uses a system that would be undoubtedly classified as "traditional", yet is consistently ranked at the top among other countries by several international tests [11]. An internationally recognized program, "Singapore Math", is based on the Singapore curriculum and has also found much success by the schools that have tried it [12]. By investigating the principles behind the Singapore math curriculum, the authors found numerous flaws in our own math education system that makes our methods weaker, even though they are based on the same "traditional" approach as those of Singapore's system [11].  The first problem in our math curriculum is its lack of specific and unified standards. Each state is free to make its own curricula, and the NCTM guidelines are vague at best; they define objectives for a range of grade levels, and therefore different states vary greatly in suggesting when basic concepts are introduced. The inconsistent structure hinders textbook companies' efforts of developing effective programs. It also becomes harder to determine the quality of new programs because the states have distinct assessment methods that influence the results of pilot- program studies. Singapore's curriculum, on the other hand, is easy to describe because it is nationalized and unified. It is therefore much easier to produce learning materials that work for all schools and to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall curriculum [11]. While a completely standardized system is less feasible in the US because of its large size and diversity, there should be more specific national standards that prevent states from producing greatly differing curricula.  The second issue with American math education lies with the textbooks' contents. Most basic math textbooks have exercises that require little thought from the student, such as one-step formula plug-ins. Students thus cannot readily apply the principles they learn to more  complicated multi-step problems because they are not usually exposed to anything beyond their textbooks' rather simple exercises [4]. Singapore's textbooks, on the other hand, have basic drills as well, but move on to more challenging problems that apply the newly-learned concepts. By thinking through more involved questions, students master the basic procedure while developing their problem solving skills [11].  A related problem is that American curricula try to cover too many concepts in a single year. Partially, this is the result of the textbook publishers' attempts to satisfy as many standards and teacher demands as possible, which ultimately stems from the lack of curriculum centralization. While Singapore's standards only require about 15 topics per grade level, some state curricula contain over 50 topics to be covered in a school year [12]. Chapters and lessons therefore tend to be shorter and less in-depth. Although exposure to a diverse range of topics can arguably be beneficial, such a wide array of topics prevents deep comprehension of any specific topic. Therefore there is no time to develop the problem solving skills needed to tackle more complicated problems [11]. Middle and high school curricula tend to be similar in terms of their lack of depth. For example, Lockhart describes precalculus as a "senseless bouillabaisse of disconnected topics", many of which are glossed over because they are not introduced in a meaningful context [4].  Another serious weakness is the lack of qualified teachers who teach grade school math. Singapore's teachers must be certified through stringent exams before they even enter an education program, where they are paid a salary that is comparable to that of actual teachers. In contrast, prospective US teachers have the lowest math SAT scores on average out of all college majors. It is difficult to expect that the very individuals who did not thoroughly master math in  school would be able to produce competent math students. Singapore teachers also undergo a rigorous professional development program in addition to extensive annual training in new skills. Meanwhile, US teachers only attend short workshops, despite the fact that these workshops are "widely admitted to be ineffective for changing practice", and teachers are not required to pass very stringent exams. In fact, the exam for certifying 6th grade teachers is easier than the exams given to Singapore sixth graders [11].  Tailoring the curriculum to students of different abilities, commonly called "tracking", is also important to ensure that all students master the material, not just the most able ones. A study showed that programs that offered more comprehensive tracking systems scored higher on math achievement tests, even after adjusting for student backgrounds [13]. Singapore addresses this problem by providing a complete alternative program for struggling students that focuses more on repetition and is taught by well-qualified teachers. By contrast, while the US provides resources for less able students, most special programs for slower math students in the US follow no real framework; students who fall behind are generally put into unofficial "extra-help" classes that are taught by aides who often have not earned a college degree. If all citizens are to have good basic math skills, then the needs of all students must be addressed and equal attention should be given to those who require more time or a different approach to grasp the material [11].  The solution to the problematic American curriculum is not as simple as just converting to the Singaporean model. Students that have already used American textbooks for a long time may not have all the skills necessary to progress to the next level in the Singapore curriculum, since the order and depth of topics are likely to differ. Also, since each level of the Singapore  curriculum assumes knowledge of concepts taught in previous levels, any conceptual holes in American students' knowledge would prevent thorough understanding of the new topics introduced [11]. Finally, a sudden transition to more complicated and problem-solving based questions could initially be extremely difficult to students who are more accustomed to the American textbook exercises. A gradual change would be more appropriate, but then choosing the ideal resources to facilitate this change becomes a difficult task.  Newly implementing the program for first-grade students is not much more straightforward. Although students may yet not be accustomed to the "American way" like older students are, there are still other differences that prevent a smooth transition. As similar as the resources may be, the quality teachers will still differ between the two countries. The Singapore program presumes training in important methods used throughout the program, which in turn presumes a level of mathematical competence that may be higher than that of many US teachers. A lengthy professional program to train teachers in the US is conceivable but would be extremely expensive and require a large commitment that teachers' unions may resist [11]. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on math and science in school is vastly different between the two countries. Not only is the average school day in Asian countries longer, but also the proportion of time spent on math in school is also much greater in Asian schools. Unless more drastic reforms like lengthening the school day are considered, schools that plan to adopt a Singaporean math program must find ways to accommodate the greater required time commitment without significantly affecting the normal structure of the school day [14].  American schools may not be able to effectively adopt a close duplicate of the Singapore program, but they can certainly implement elements that make the Singapore curriculum  successful. Greater unification of standards across states would allow national textbook companies to provide more focus in their textbooks, as well as make reforms much simpler to carry out and assess. A more comprehensive track can be produced for students with greater trouble, and ideally, such classes are taught by qualified teachers. While the abilities of American teachers will not suddenly change, more substantial professional development programs rather than short, occasional workshops can improve how well they teach the new material. Furthermore, standards for future teachers should increase to ensure that the new generation of teachers are mathematically confident themselves before they try to present their knowledge of math to their students. While we do not need a population of scientists and mathematicians, all people should be able to know enough mathematics to understand how numbers are used in everyday life, such as for basic tax accounting or recipes. With these reforms in mind, we can envision a society in which statistics mean more to everyone than just vague numbers to spice up an article. Perhaps then, young students will master their multiplication tables sooner, so that rather than being stuck on basic facts, they can begin to build the critical thinking skills necessary to become mathematically literate citizens.  Discussion  4 comments for "Multiplication Tables? Dismal State of U.S. Mathematics Education"  Sidney Rosenbloom  The problem is cultural. Yes, cultural.  Over the past 30 or so years I have been following calls for educational (K-12) reform, math and science educational reform, saw oh so many task forces, blue ribbon commissions, expensive consultant-produced studies, thousands comments of hopeful or confused and off-target members of the public, all the way from Adm. Rickover commission to Bush's No Child Left behind etc.  This country, i.e. the middle class and its hopes for maintaining standard of living or at least preventing its further erosion, needs to have its education-industrial complex, it (in essence non-existing, globally really competitive) workforce training, some of its corporate priorities, globally proven governmental economic policies and somehow revised social contract aligned toward EXPORT-oriented business and societal mindset.  Along these lines we (again, the middle class hopes for reasonable standard of living) also radically change our value system and instead having so many students majoring in business, marketing, communication, creative writing, etc. etc. down to law believe in, appreciate, build export based job and career future for graduates of engineering, math, hard science fields.  Is this going to happen?  Unfortunately not, as cultural habits and preferences we share and keep so dear, along with our model of individualistic-at-any cost of capitalism (compared to say a continental/German/Scandinavian/Japanese version of capitalism) are – along with legislative bodies being bought by the top 1% will prevent any REAL, bona fide chance of such fundamental reform.  Obama's daughters will not also study engineering or science but might do law or something "soft" as the middle class will not start sending their kids to study science, math, engineering.  Popular culture (TV etc.) will continue to glamorize physicians, sleek lawyers, financiers, not "nerds" in IT, engineering, or science.  Neither party has any plan along these lines as well. One shouts about even less in taxes the other one demands traditional benefits of giving out fish instead teaching how to catch or farm one.  Our pride, inertia, ideology will continue to prevent us from adopting system such as in Germany, demonstrating, year after year, that yes, it is i possible to "spoil" workers with high wages, give them 6 weeks of annual paid vacation, universal health care, strong labor and environmental regulations, even strong euro (yes) and have the economy make so many HIGH-VALUE-added TANGIBLE products that the rest of the world is willing to buy to have export surpluses so large that only in 2009 another export-oriented giant, 15-times larger Peoples Republic of China took over as #1 exporter.  To close: math education at K-12 levels is outrage as I know, as MS in engineering, parent of six children (with top SAT scores and successful professional careers) and someone who have kept my hopes that it will get better. Sorry to say, also feminization of our K-12 system doesn't help either while it seems to "help" obsessive emphasis on writing, creative/persuasive writing as we have been increasingly trying to sell each other services with increasingly "sophisticated" spiel, while export-oriented countries flood our market with their tangible products.  As our huge post-WW2 free ride via monopoly on printing (increasingly worthless) reserve currency will gradually come to end, chicken will come to roost in earnest. As a billionaire Sam Zell estimates, American standard of living will then drop another 25 – 30%.  Again: I do not see any force changing this cultural predisposition. We even refuse, at Reagan's "advice" to adopt the metric system to start with.  jumper  First, thanks for the history lesson above in this article! But did you ever stop to think as we are getting closer to how the brain really works and the technology of brain scans we can do are showing the different areas of how and what the brain can do and can not do. So, my question for all of you who think it is because, " Oh they need to try harder" and "they are just lazy" or " they just do not have the right tutor" How sadly wrong you are and how many students fall through the cracks of the educational system that makes students fit a certain system that needed up grading years ago!  Secondly, it is simple logical answer, students may have a severe math disorder that will not allow them to go as far as their school program requires them too. What I mean by math disorder it is one that neurologically can not be helped by a tutor or taking a pill either! So, you say that student shouldn't go into that program! I know a student who is in a PhD program but yet can only do 9th grade level math! This student is exceptional in all areas of the program but the math. The math isn't really needed in the program since in the "real world" they use computers to compute the math problems.  Thirdly, all of those who have gone through the educational system of the universities and jumped through their hoops will good for you and I mean it! You are the few lucky ones that can actually do it. But that is ONLY because your genetic make-up doesn't have any faulty neurological problems that will interfere with your educational endeavors. However, I bet those that have been through the educational system may have Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis later in their late years of life and other elements that we can all see. I needed to bring this up in my post here is these individuals who have passed their educational programs feel they are "privileged" and that everyone else should go through the same thing they went through especially attorneys when they have to take the seditious bar exam as one example. These same individuals really have a problem with others who can not do what they just accomplished. All I can say to those who do not and have not had to deal with neurological set backs in the educational system you are very fortunate and very lucky too I might add! You are not any more special than the rest of us and all of us humans have some sort of element that we have to deal with in our life we are ALL fallibly creatures!  And lastly, here is a list of famous people who were/are very successful without math! They all had something in common too they had some kind of math/educational disability. Here is the list: Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, George Washington, Leonardo da Vinci. Of course this list can go on and on but yet it has been talked about over and over the gifted really do not fit the molds these universities so make it to be the only way to succeed. I'm not surprised that Yale University originally wrote this article they are one of many universities that perpetuate this way of thinking. May the creative and the intelligence people rise above oppression ..like the late Steve Jobs!  Education advocate  Your point is well taken. However, many children's struggle in math is the result of poor instruction and not neurological problem and if teachers cannot effectively teach math because of inadequate training and programming to children without neurological challenges that is a problem that needs to be addressed, don't you agree?   Jessica Ramer  Understanding mathematics requires both abstract reasoning and a solid knowledge base–which is developed largely through memorization.  As I have struggled to help kids learn, I am struck by *how many* kids seem unable to memorize multiplication facts–even after repeated coaching and drills. I have tried having the kids write out the tables, quizzing them orally, having them listen to CDS and even after months of work, they still fail. It is not a lack of effort on their part or mine, it is something else. Keep in mind that these kids do not have diagnosed learning disabilities, are not struggling to learn in a second language, and are not from America's most impoverished regions. I can't shake the gut feeling that something is seriously wrong with many of America's children, although I don't have a clue what it is. Bad diet? Too much electronic entertainment that has destroyed their ability to focus? Has cell phone radiation impaired their memory? (Don't laugh. It seems to impair learning in lab rats.) Maybe I was clueless as a kid, but it seems to me that 40 years ago, nearly all kids knew their multiplication tables by the end of third grade. Of course, teachers reviewed it every year to be sure, but most of us knew. I would appreciate comments from other teachers on this phenomenon.

__label__0 This collection is included inLens:Community College Open Textbook Collaborative By: CC Open Textbook Collaborative Algebra: VectorsFor our purposes, a vector is a collection of real numbers in a one- dimensional array.1 We usually think of the array as being arranged in a column and write  x=x1x2x3|xnx=x1x2x3|xn .  Notice that we indicate a vector with boldface and the constituent elements with subscripts. A real number by itself is called a scalar, in distinction from a vector or a matrix. We say that xx is an n-vector, meaning that xx has nn elements. To indicate that x1x1 is a real number, we write  x1∈R,x1∈R,  (1)  meaning that x1x1 is contained in RR, the set of real numbers. To indicate that xx is a vector of nn real numbers, we write  x∈Rn,x∈Rn,  (2)  meaning that xx is contained in RnRn, the set of real n-tuples. Geometrically, RnRnis n-dimensional space, and the notation x∈Rnx∈Rn means that xx is a point in that space, specified by the nn coordinates x1,x2,...,xnx1,x2,...,xn. Figure 1 shows a vector in R3R3, drawn as an arrow from the origin to the point xx. Our geometric intuition begins to fail above three dimensions, but the linear algebra is completely general.  Figure 1: A Vector in R3  We sometimes find it useful to sketch vectors with more than three dimensions in the same way as the three-dimensional vector of Figure 1. We then consider each axis to represent more than one dimension, a hyperplane, in our n-dimensional space. We cannot show all the details of what is happening in n-space on a three-dimensional figure, but we can often show important features and gain geometrical insight.  Vector Addition. Vectors with the same number of elements can be added and subtracted in a very natural way:  Example 1  The difference between the vector x=111x=111 and the vector y=001y=001 is the vector z=x-y=110z=x-y=110. These vectors are illustrated in Figure 2. You can see that this result is consistent with the definition of vector subtraction in Equation 3. You can also picture the subtraction in Figure 2 by mentally reversing the direction of vector yy to get -y-y and then adding it to xx by sliding it to the position where its tail coincides with the head of vector xx. (The head is the end with the arrow.) When you slide a vector to a new position for adding to another vector, you must not change its length or direction.  Figure 2: Subtraction of Vectors  Exercise 1  Compute and plot x+yx+y and x-yx-y for each of the following cases:  x=132,y=123x=132,y=123 ;  x=-13-2,y=123x=-13-2,y=123 ;  x=1-32,y=132x=1-32,y=132.  Scalar Product. Several different kinds of vector multiplication are defined.2 We begin with the scalar product. Scalar multiplication is defined for scalar aa and vector xx as  ax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.ax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.  (4)  If |a|<1|a|<1, then the vector axax is "shorter" than the vector x; if |a|>1|a|>1, then the vector axax is '"longer" than x. This is illustrated for a 2-vector in Figure 3.  Figure 3: The Scalar Product axax  Exercise 2  Compute and plot the scalar product axax when x=11/2l/4x=11/2l/4 for each of the following scalars:  a=1;a=1;  a=-1;a=-1;  a=-1/4;a=-1/4;  a=2.a=2.  Exercise 3  Given vectors x,y,z∈Rnx,y,z∈Rn and the scalar a∈Ra∈R, prove the following identities:  Footnotes  In a formal development of linear algebra, the abstract concept of a vector space plays a fundamental role. We will leave such concepts to a complete course in linear algebra and introduce only the functional techniques necessary to solve the problems at hand.  The division of two vectors is undefined, although three different "divisions" are defined

__label__0 Math 1C  Text: JAMES STEWART: Calculus Early Transcendentals SIXTH edition (Note that we are NOT using 7th edition)  Graphing calculator required: TI- 83+, 84+ are the recommended models. I will generally be demonstrating with a TI-83 or 84 in class. TI-89 or any other calculator that can do symbolic mathematics, has a computer algebra systems or can graph in 3D will NOT be allowed on any exams or quizzes in this class. If you have a TI-89 or similar calculator, it will be wonderful for homework and learning but out of fairness to all students, you can not use it for exams or quizzes. TI-83, 84, 86 calculators are available on loan from the library for several hours or several days at a time. There is a limited supply.  This course will use a website in CATALYST at  Catalyst is De Anza College's course management system. Enrolled students will be able to log in to the course website as of the beginning of spring quarter:  For graphing on a TI-83 or TI-89 The TI-83 and TI-89 support a sequence graphing mode that is not available on the TI-86. You can use the sequence graphing mode to graph a sequence or partial sums of a series. You can also adapt the methods posted above for the TI-86; the TI-83 and TI-89 have all the same functionalities of the TI-86 that is used in those two sets of instructions. Your keystrokes will be different in order to find those settings or functions; if you can't locate a function or setting, look in the Catalog. Note that the TI-83 and TI-89 do not support custom menus that can be set up in the TI-86.  Optional: Proof by contradiction that e is irrational  This is an indirect proof that relies on the series expansion of e. If you have taken Math 22 (Discrete Math), you have proved that the square root of 2 is irrational, using a proof by contradiction. You now have the tools to prove that e is irrational.

__label__0 Calculus  Calculus is a branch of mathematics that expands upon the principles used in algebra and geometry to include the idea of limits. There are two main sub-categories of calculus—differential calculus and integral calculus. Each has a different focus.  Integral calculus deals with the idea of accumulation, while differential calculus examines the rate of change. Common calculus terminology includes words such as integrals, functions and derivatives.  The following academic lectures are designed to give you insight into this branch of mathematics and help you understand the concepts involved in calculus.

__label__0 Measure and Integration. A Concise Introduction to Real Analysis  John Wiley and Sons Ltd, July 2009, Pages: 238  A uniquely accessible book for general measure and integration, emphasizing the real line, Euclidean space, and the underlying role of translation in real analysis  Measure and Integration: A Concise Introduction to Real Analysis presents the basic concepts and methods that are important for successfully reading and understanding proofs. Blending coverage of both fundamental and specialized topics, this book serves as a practical and thorough introduction to measure and integration, while also facilitating a basic understanding of real analysis.  The author develops the theory of measure and integration on abstract measure spaces with an emphasis of the real line and Euclidean space. Additional topical coverage includes:  Measure spaces, outer measures, and extension theorems  - Lebesgue measure on the line and in Euclidean space  - Measurable functions, Egoroff's theorem, and Lusin's theorem  - Convergence theorems for integrals  - Product measures and Fubini's theorem  - Differentiation theorems for functions of real variables  - Decomposition theorems for signed measures  - Absolute continuity and the Radon-Nikodym theorem  - Lp spaces, continuous-function spaces, and duality theorems  - Translation-invariant subspaces of L2 and applications  The book's presentation lays the foundation for further study of functional analysis, harmonic analysis, and probability, and its treatment of real analysis highlights the fundamental role of translations. Each theorem is accompanied by opportunities to employ the concept, as numerous exercises explore applications including convolutions, Fourier transforms, and differentiation across the integral sign.  Providing an efficient and readable treatment of this classical subject, Measure and Integration: A Concise Introduction to Real Analysis is a useful book for courses in real analysis at the graduate level. It is also a valuable reference for practitioners in the mathematical sciences.  Preface.  Acknowledgments.

__label__0 Complex Analysis,2 Edition  The idea of this book is to give an extensive description of the classical complex analysis, here ''classical'' means roughly that sheaf theoretical and cohomological methods are omitted.  The first four chapters cover the essential core of complex analysis presenting their fundamental results. After this standard material, the authors step forward to elliptic functions and to elliptic modular functions including a taste of all most beautiful results of this field. The book is rounded by applications to analytic number theory including distinguished pearls of this fascinating subject as for instance the Prime Number Theorem. Great importance is attached to completeness, all needed notions are developed, only minimal prerequisites (elementary facts of calculus and algebra) are required.  More than 400 exercises including hints for solutions and many figures make this an attractive, indispensable book for students who would like to have a sound introduction to classical complex
__label__0 Number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., and related objects that arise in their study. It is tempting to assume that something as simple as the counting numbers must be rather well understood. But this is far from the case! Indeed, number theory owes much of its charm to the wealth of easily-stated problems -- possible to explain to middle-school age children -- which have so far defied solution, despite hundreds of years of effort by great mathematicians.  This course is designed to introduce you to the foundational results, with particular attention paid to some the pathbreaking accomplishments of the 18th and 19th centuries. We will start with the basic theory (factorization into primes) before turning to Gauss's theory of congruences. The theory of congruences culminates with a proof of Gauss's Aureum Theorema (golden theorem), the law of quadratic reciprocity.  More advanced topics will be discussed later in the course. Possibilities include theorems about sums of squares, results on arithmetic functions, and results on the distribution of prime numbers.  Number theory, more than some other areas of mathematics, is largely an experimental science. It is recommended (but not required) that you download software that allows you to play with very large numbers. This is a great way to get an intuitive handle on the results we discuss. Commercial packages of this sort include Maple and Mathematica, but there are also free (even open source!) options, such as gp/PARI.  HW assignments will contain problems required of all students, as well as more challenging problems required only for MATH 6400 students. Undergraduate participants may do these additional problems for extra credit.  You are expected to participate in class. In particular, attendance in this course is required. More than four unexcused absences may result in you receiving a WF. Keep me posted whenever you have a conflict that requires you to miss class and this should not be an issue.  All exams are in-class, closed book and closed notes.  Homework will be collected in class, about once each week. Late homework will not be accepted. (If you have a need to turn in HW early, that can be arranged.) Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the term.  On homework, collaboration is allowed and in fact is very much encouraged. Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently. Keep in mind that by entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA Honor code described in detail at <URL:   In practice, what this means that you may discuss homework problems and their solutions with your classmates, but you may not turn in a solution unless you understand it yourself. A reasonable rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain your solutions verbally to me (in all their gory detail) if requested to do so.  The withdrawal policy for this course is that if you withdraw within a week of the date the first midterm is handed back, you automatically qualify for a WP (assuming you are eligible by UGA's standards). After that point, it is at the discretion of the instructor (i.e., me) who will take your performance in the class to-date into account.  Special accommodationsDisclaimer  This course syllabus provides a general plan for the course; deviations may be necessary.

__label__0 The purpose of this book is to help students in calculus1 get a good practice for the midterms and final exams during their school year in calculus1. All the finals and midterms are real exams (with little changes) from several Universities around America ( USA, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico).  We believe to get a good grade in the midterms and final, the student should after reviewing his/her homework and notes pick some real midterms and final and do them.  We tried this idea with several students and it works very well.  We wish you all success in your studies.  Muslim Mathematical Society and Salah Abdel Hamid  Preview coming soon.

__label__0 Kirk's Tutoring Blog  Ideally, if you have prepared well, the last 24-48 hours should be dedicated to adequate rest. However the world isn't quite a perfect sphere, and we do not always have the perfect situation. If you haven't fully study yet, the volume of material to cover in these last 24-48 hours may be too much, therefore we need a survey strategy. The following works best for computational subjects such as math, physics, chemistry or disciplines such as engineering.  If this is a college prep/standardized test, take the practice test again...  The summer months are all but gone, withered into a faded memory, like an old black and white photo. Lets hope that it was as enjoyable as it was productive. Its time to turn a new leaf in the chapter of life. New challenges, new faces, new subjects and more tests. So what did you do in the summer to keep motivated, or practice new habits?  Here are my suggestions to staying motivated throughout the summer. * Read a new book/s. * Volunteer. * Apply the knowledge gained through the school year to a project that you wanted to do but never completed. * Research something you were interested...  Proof techniques are fun. They are mathematical arguments of sufficiency. The feeling you get from arguing your point logically to completion is always exhilarating. Let us put our mathematical reasoning power to the test. Now since this is our first of many proof techniques. I will start with something elementary.  1. Prove the following:  (a) Given that the average of y and z is odd, then z is an odd integer when y is odd.  When doing proofs it is best to do so in algebraic and generalized form. A way to represent all possible cases. Using only examples would be trivial, since we know...  Students often ask me how do Mathematicians come up with various formulas in Trigonometry, Algebra and Calculus? By method of Proofs and Derivation I would exclaim, which in my opinion is becoming a lost art. I found deriving formulas helped to seal the understanding of the concepts and theories in Math. I believe it is thus fitting as an end to our talk on polynomials, to derive the equation of the quadratic formula. We will do so by using the last method we discussed, "Completing the Square".  It has been a while since my last post, but as promised I am back. Recently a reader of one of my blogs commented on how helpful they were in helping her explain a concept to her HS Junior. I was indeed very glad to hear. It certainly is an encouragement to see parents, not only sign their child up for tutoring but also willing to follow through the covered material as well. Expanding on the purpose of the blog page, would be a forum board where students/parents can post short questions and have tutor respond and perhaps even have their answers rated on helpfulness. This I believe would make...  Horizontal Shifts: Let f be a function and c a positive real number. * The graph of y = f (x + c) is the graph of y = f (x) shifted to the left c units. * The graph of y = f (x - c) is the graph of y = f (x) shifted to the right c units.  Reflection about the x-Axis: * The graph of y = - f (x) is the graph of y = f(x) reflected about the x-axis.  A student got 50% of the questions on an algebra test correct. If he answered 10 out of the first 12 questions asked correctly but missed 3/4 of the remaining questions, how many questions were on the test?  So algebraically we need to setup an equation here. The sum of the 10 correctly answered questions and the remaining questions that were answered correctly divided by the total number of questions is 0.5. Let y represent the number of remaining questions answered correctly. Let x represent the number of questions in total. Then;  We have reviewing the six pillars of a good study habits, skills and strategies. Now I will talk about basic study techniques in assimilating the material. There are many self help books on how to study but to be honest the approach could vary based on the individuals learning abilities, the subject content at hand as well as the intent of the study session. There is no one size fits all approach. Studying is a discipline and as such, do start early, make a commitment at the beginning of the semester/the school year. Don't wait until it is too late and be overwhelmed with...  Throughout the school year I have worked with several students from diverse economic and social backgrounds. In the sessions I had the chance to observe their study habits, their improvements and successes. From these observations I gathered some interesting and useful information that I believe will help others avoid the pitfalls of bad study habits, ill preparation and last minute cramming for tests/exams. These suggestions may be self evident but if followed will contribute to improvement in learning, retention, and finally the...  Today I was working with a student preparing him for the upcoming SAT in June. We came across an interesting question, which I will share with everyone here.

In order to solve a system of equations involving four unknowns, we need four equations (relationships). We are only given three relationships, "Houston we have a problem." Do not worry, we have another approach. Let us find x in terms of...

__label__0 Description Physics The course is a 2 DVD series, 11 full You  How are the MathTutorDVD.com line of DVDs different from others? The answer is simple. Most math instruction involves a lengthy discussion of the abstract theory behind the Math before instructing the student in how to solve problems. While there are some merits to this style, in the vast majority of the cases the student quickly gets bored and frustrated by the time he or she starts to solve the problems. This DVD, in contrast, teaches all of the concepts by working fully narrated problems step-by-step, which is a much more engaging way to learn.  Exceptional value and affordability. MathTutorDVD.com believes in providing value for our customers. This is a 11 Hour DVD course. We could have easily split this content into many DVD courses costing the same price but instead chose to keep the cost down so that this content is affordable to all.  What is our teaching style like? All topics on this DVD are taught by working example problems. There are no traditional lectures of background material that won't help you solve problems and improve your skills. We believe in teaching-by-doing and that is what you will receive by watching this DVD. The Equations Of Motion are explained, for example, by working many problems in step-by-step detail. We begin with the easier problems and work our way up to the harder problems. The student immediately gains confidence, does not get bored, and quickly feels like he or she can conquer the material. This method is extremely powerful and has proven itself time and again. Perhaps most importantly, problem solving skills are honed early on that will help with homework and taking exams even after watching the very first lesson.
__label__0 Calculator: Calculators may come in handy during class or in your homework from time to time, but I will not require you to have one. They will be allowed on tests and homework, though on tests you will find them to be of limited value. If you intend on sharing a calculator with a friend, keep in mind that sharing calculators is not permitted on exams.  Ideally, a calculator should be able to do ordinary arithmetic operations, as well as some additional functions like exponentiation (powers) and square roots. It need not be able to graph or be programmed.  Note that cell phones and laptops are not allowed during exams, so if your only calculator is a calculator program on your cell phone or laptop, you will want to get a stand-alone calculator, or you will not have one during the exams. In general, nothing that will permit electronic communication with another student or people outside the room may be used on exams.  Web page:   Email list: math102@yahoogroups.com (when you fill out your information you may elect to be on this list)  Prerequisites: None.  Well, what math background are you expected to have? I realize that the range of math classes taken by students in math 102 varies widely, and this includes the extent to which students remember various facts. This course, however, is not in sequence with the standard math sequence, and so mastery of past math subjects is not as relevant in this class as compared to what you might be used to.  Most of the course is based on concepts rather than specific skills, though some skill will come in handy at some points. Though these times are relatively rare, the strong reaction some students feel when they do not know the relevant skils may make it loom large in their minds. Most of these skills, when they come up, are at the pre-algebra and algebra level: using variables, understanding algebraic expressions, and sometimes solving simple equations. It is assumed that students have had exposure to algebra and geometry at some point, but it is not assumed that they have a strong mastery of either subject.  If you find you need some review on some topic like this that is used in class, come by my office hours or use the tutoring service mentioned above.  The Idea of this class: This is most likely a very different kind of math class than you have ever had. Most math classes you have experienced emphasize skills: how to solve a quadratic equation, or how to find an unknown side in a triangle. This class will emphasize ideas and concepts. ``How to do it'' will take a back seat to ``Why does it work?''  This is also a course where we seek to discover math together. I'm not here to tell you the answer; I'm more of a guide to help you explore a mathematical concept. Through this course, I hope to show you the big picture: what mathematics is all about. This is something that many students don't see in high school courses, or even some college level courses. Once you see math from this point of view, I hope you will be able to see why mathematicians feel that mathematics is beautiful, or how creativity, imagination, and logical thinking can work together in mathematics. I hope you will see how mathematics is part of what our civilization is all about: where we have been and where we are going, and why, to be a truly educated person, one must have some facility with mathematics.  Beyond this, we will see ten {\em Lessons For Life} as they apply to mathematics. These lessons are to be found throughout the textbook, though they are also at the end on p. 619 for ready reference. I hope these {\em Lessons For Life}, illustrated through mathematical problem solving, will serve you as you face other kinds of problems in your life.  Goals: The student should develop:  An ability to translate a problem which is well-suited to mathematical solutions into mathematical language;  An ability to think and reason in a structured logical manner;  An ability to use mathematical reasoning to understand problems;  An appreciation for what mathematics is all about, and what mathematicians do;  An idea for the logical structure of mathematics, and proof;  An appreciation for the applicability, subtlety and beauty of mathematics;  an ability to approach problems in life analytically.  Objectives: The specific objectives of this course will partly be determined by the students in one of the first assignments. Students will select topics from the book that are of greatest interest to them, and the course will be based on what topics are most popular.  The point is that these subjects are merely a vehicle to introduce the student to mathematics: logical thinking, quantitative sense, great and profound ideas, and creative problem-solving. These cannot be taught in the abstract, but must be carried by more concrete examples, and these examples will be the occasion for us to discover mathematics together.  Homework: Homework will be assigned twice a week; homework assigned on Tuesday will be due on Thursday, and homework assigned on Thursday will be due on Tuesday. Homework should be turned in at the beginning of class.  The two lowest homework scores will be disregarded.  Remember that the primary purpose of the homework is to learn the material, so if you miss one, or do not take it seriously, you will fall behind in the course material and will not do well on exams.  Late assignments: No late homework is accepted. Exceptions can be granted, if you must give me notice that you are going to turn in an assignment late at least the class before the assignment is due. You must also have a good reason. These reasons will be treated on a case-by-case basis. When you obtain permission to turn in an assignment late, we will discuss a new due date for that homework.  Collaboration: You are encouraged to collaborate on all homework assignments, unless otherwise specified. This means you work on it independently before discussing it with each other, and it means you must thoroughly understand how to do the problem before writing it up. You must write up your answers separately; you cannot turn in one homework for more than one person, nor can you simply include photocopies of other students' work. There is no limit to the size of a group for collaboration, although 3-5 people tends to be an efficient size.  You should also use these groups to ask questions of each other to better understand the material. If you do not see each other frequently, you should set up a regular time and place to meet to work on assignments. If you do not have a group, talk to me and I can place you in a group. If you do not wish to work in a group, that is your prerogative but this will be a disadvantage to you.  Comments: You should include comments about the class at the top of your homework assignments. These comments can be ``This class is going too fast'', ``I like this section'', ``This is too easy/hard'', ``Can we have more connections to music'', ``Everything's okay'', and so on. You will not be graded on these comments, but they will affect how I teach the class, and may make the class more enjoyable for you.  Class participation: You are expected to actively participate in class. Many students view learning as a passive act, where the teacher takes the only active role, and the student simply listens, or at most takes notes. This view is not advisable in this class. Here, you will need to take an active role in learning the material. {\em You} are in charge of your education, and {\em you} should take responsibility to learn the material as thoroughly as you can.  This is especially true in this class. As you will discover, this class is not a lecture-style class, where I simply proclaim information to you and you record the information in your notes. Rather, we will be engaged in mathematics discovery together.  Ten percent of your grade is based on my estimate of your class participation throughout the term. Mostly this is easy points: you don't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged in the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make. In fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this course, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for waiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.  Attendance: Attendance is important. The whole point of the class is for us to discover mathematics together, and you cannot do that if you are not here. Skipping even a single class will mean you will not likely be able to do the work or know what is happening in the next class period. This is not the sort of class where just reading the material in the book will allow you to do the work. And, of course, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points. In short, skip class at your peril.  Exams: There will be three midterms, and one final. Each midterm counts for 16% of your grade, and the final counts for 22%. Homework counts for 20% and class participation for 10%. the final exam grade will substitute for your lowest midterm grade if this is to your advantage. Borderline grades could go either way, depending on the effort I see you put into the class.  There are no make up exams. If you must miss an exam due to a major emergency, you must make arrangements with me beforehand, and exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis. If granted, your final exam score will be used to calculate the score for the missed exam.  Midterms will be during the normal class period. Both midterms and final will occur in the normal classroom for the class. Dates for these tests are as follows:  Midterm 1  Sep 29  during class  Midterm 2  Oct 27  during class  Midterm 3  Dec 1  during class  Final (sec. 3)  Dec 13  1:30 p.m.--4:00 p.m.  Final (sec. 4)  Dec 14  1:30 p.m.--4:00 p.m.  I will hold review sessions before each, at a time that is popular with the class.  Holidays:  Labor Day  Sep 5  Conference  Oct 7  Thanksgiving  Nov 24--25  Grading: A grade of C indicates an ability to do homework-like problems, and memorization of all techniques and definitions. In order to receive a B, a student must demonstrate a deeper knowledge of the material, being able to apply the course material to new circumstances where applicable. An A student must demonstrate this kind of deep understanding in all of the covered topics, as well as be able to draw new conclusions from known facts in a logical manner, and must also demonstrate persistence and dilligence. In the other direction, a grade of D shows only superficial understanding of the material, and shows inconsistency to do straightforward problems. An F grade indicates that the student has severe gaps in even superficial understanding of the material in the course.  Although this is the philosophy, grading will be done by counting points received on each problem, as usual. But the difficulty level of the problems will be arranged in order to achieve the above grading scale.  Christian attitude: Although not part of the grading for this course, you are expected to approach this class with a Christian attitude, being willing to help your fellow classmates to understand the material outside of class, being willing to be corrected by your fellow classmates when you see they are right, but firm in your conviction otherwise, being bold to ask questions without feeling ashamed of looking foolish, encouraging one another in love, being patient with those who are asking questions, and preferring a grasp of the material, which is enduring and becomes part of you, over a grade, which is transient, external, and shallow. You should diligently devote the time you spend on this class as to the Lord. As cheating harms both the cheater and the rest of the class (though in different ways), you should not cheat, nor should you provide temptations for others to cheat.  For my part, I commit to approaching this class with a Christian attitude, viewing my role as that of a servant, being concerned first for your personal, especially intellectual, development. I will also seek to produce an environment of encouragement and love, that fosters a sense of community and understanding. I commit to reporting grades that accurately and honestly reflect the level of work done in the class, as described in the paragraphs above. I also commit the time I spend preparing for this class as to the Lord, and I will pray for all individuals in the class on a regular basis, understanding that even as I may seek to educate, God provides the true transformation.
__label__0 Mathematics Department Handbook  Welcome to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Rochester.  We have compiled these notes in order to assist you, the first year student, in making the transition from high school to university. This is sometimes a difficult process for various reasons. As far as first year mathematics courses go, there are two main difficulties:  First, the Department of Mathematics expects students who take courses in mathematics to take the responsibility for mastering the course material. There is lots of assistance offered, all detailed in these notes, but it is your responsibility to use these resources. Second, many talented students have been able to do well in their high school math courses in spite of not having regular work habits, but now the situation is very different. It is almost impossible to pass first year university mathematics courses without developing these habits. We hope this Guide will help you learn how.  We have also included in these notes some hints on study techniques and writing examinations, expanded descriptions of first year courses, and a reading list for students interested in expanding their knowledge of mathematics in a general way.  Again, welcome, and we wish you every success in your academic endeavors.

__label__0 Journals and books  Journals and books  A central part of the NCM enterprise is the Nämnaren Project. The project is aimed at teachers, teacher trainers, researchers and the staff responsable for basic education, further education and development work - and consists of different parts:  Nämnaren the journal for mathematics education, publishes four issues annually. Plans are made for a fifth issue in English. In December 2000 a new book was published, "Matematikk & undervisning, Norden 2000". On the occasion of the World Mathematics Year, 2000, the editors for the Nordic journals have decided to publish a book about "Mathematics education in the Nordic classroom. Year 2000". Studies at different ages are described - from six-year-olds to trainee teachers. The purpose is to stimulate communication concerning the development of mathematics as a subject in the Scandinavian countries. The book has been forwarded to all subscribers of Nämnaren as a gift to mark the occasion of the World Mathematics Year 2000.  Nämnaren on the web inclusive of Nämnaren's data base, a searchable data base which can be located via the NCM web site. The data base contains an outline of approximately 2300 articles published since the start in 1974.  NämnarenTEMA began with some smaller projects followed up by the National Agency for Education project for support and stimulance material for teachers (1993-95). The aim was to analyse the news, facilitate interpretation of the curriculum and evaluation, deal with the area of weaknesses in the field of Swedish mathematics education in compulsory and upper secondary schools documented in Swedish and international studies. The responsibility for this work was transferred in 1995 to the Nämnaren project. So far, four books have been published, and three more are in preparation. The series is a result of cooperation between researchers, teacher educators and teachers.  The Mathematics Biennial 2000 - Time For Mathematics One of the first assignments of the NCM was to organise and implement the 11th mathematics biennial in Göteborg 27-29 January, 2000 - up to now the biggest biennial. 280 lecturers provided 334 programme points for 5000 participants. Three students were invited from every teacher training area; in return they brought exhibition materials about their own education. Special seminars were built into the programme for the exchange of experiences between 170 students from different universities, and between students and the NCM. A Research conference for 130 participants in collaboration with the Swedish Association for Mathematics Education Research, SMDF and NCM started. International researchers from 16 different countries participated and took part later in the biennial. The documentation is produced by SMDF with support from NCM. Ten discussion groups with a total of 500 participants were initiated within chosen problem areas where the possibilities for improvement are considerable. The conference site on the NCM web site will be available. The discussions will hopefully lead to a mapping of the needs of competence development and development work within the respective areas.
__label__0 Math for Elementary Teachers II  Welcome to Mth126: "Continued study of the mathematical concepts and techniques that are fundamental to, and form the basis for, elementary school mathematics. Topics include: use of probability and statistics to explore real-world problems; representation and analysis of discrete mathematical problems using counting techniques, sequences, graph theory, arrays and networks; use of functions, algebra and the basic concepts underlying the calculus in real-world-applications."  News and Updates - Spring 2011  See the Homework and Handouts table below to download or print the syllabus, calendar, and all homework sets and class notes.
__label__0 . Premise: Mathematical results are expressed in a foreign language. This course teaches mathematical symbolism and reasoning as if it were expressed in a foreign language (It is!). Like other languages, the language of mathematics has its own grammar, syntax, vocabulary, word order, synonyms, negations, conventions, idioms, abbreviations, sentence structure, and paragraph structure. It has certain language features unparalleled in other languages, such as representation (For example, when "x" is a dummy variable it may represent any real number or any numerical expression, including "2x - 1" and "b"). The language also includes a large component of logic. The Language of Mathematics emphasizes all these features of the language (Esty, 1992 discussion of how to read, write, speak, and think mathematics.  Fortunately, mathematical sentences and paragraphs are generally written in a limited number of easily distinguishable patterns. Students who are taught to recognize these patterns find mathematics far more comprehensible than those who are not. Furthermore, their abilities to solve problems and do proofs are much enhanced (Esty and Teppo, 1994).  Most examples come from algebra, functions, and set theory (not trig or calculus), but the material is the language itself, which is essential for all areas of mathematics. Since this material is not emphasized in any other course, the course level is hard to peg. Some parts look like a "transition to advanced mathematics" course, but, with this unique approach, many students who regard themselves as "terribly math anxious" do very well with the material (Esty and Teppo, 1994).  For a thorough explanation of how the language is essential to mathematics, see "Language Concepts of Mathematics" (Esty) in FOCUS on Learning Problems in Mathematics 14.4 (Fall, 1992) pp. 31-54. For the effectiveness of this course, see "A General-Education Course Emphasizing Mathematical Language and Reasoning" (Esty and Teppo) in FOCUS on Learning Problems in Mathematics 16.1 (Winter, 1994) pp. 13-35. For an article on grading in the context of this course, see the Mathematics Teacher, 85.8 (Nov. 1992) pp.616-618 "Grade assignment based on progressive improvement" (Esty and Teppo), reprinted in Emphasis on Assessment, NCTM, 1996.  Because the organization and emphasis of the material is radically new, the use of the text is not (yet) widespread. Idaho State and Montana State have decided that it will be necessary for Elementary Education majors (It was not designed for them, but they seem to have special difficulties with abstract symbolism and this course can cure that). At Montana State it has been successfully offered twelve years to general students and four times in the summer to secondary math teachers (who knew the procedures of mathematics, but were not so comfortable with expressing them symbolically. A research paper on this will eventually appear). The course was actually designed with freshman math majors in mind, but, general-education students in it found that they could "finally" understand mathematics, so, when the word got around, they became the majority of the audience.  Equivalent courses: Probably no other text yields an equivalent course. At MSU the course number is Math 151. The level would be about equivalent to a basic logic course -- but, it is only partly logic and, in The Language of Mathematics, the logic is illustrated by and selected for mathematics. The course is more sophisticated (abstract) than Algebra II, but the content is not at all like "College Algebra" or "Precalculus." Surprisingly, many students who fail algebra in college (even remedial Algebra I) learn very well in this course if they are mature enough to actually do the reading and the work. It counts as a "core" course in mathematics at Montana State and Idaho State. It is somewhat above the level of "Finite Math."
__label__0 Course Requires a Media Kit to be Purchased by Course Sponsor (see additional details below): No  Description: No matter what you plan on majoring in once you go off to college, you will have to take at least one math course before you graduate. Statistics is required by just about every major. Business, science, and technology degrees need basic calculus. Even many education and liberal arts programs require a course in graphical analysis and/or trigonometry.  That is why Math You Can Use In College was developed. We will spend time on concepts you could possibly use again and not on the concepts you will probably never see after high school. This course is application-based and focuses on important real-life topics including:  A common thread throughout the course is the use of spreadsheets to help evaluate these mathematical explorations. Students should have, at a minimum, a fundamental understanding of how spreadsheets work. All students are required to have access to Microsoft Excel, or an alternative spreadsheet based program. An online graphing calculator will also be used during the coursegovhs.org.  14 Intro to Calculus -Basic differentiation -Applications of the derivative  15 Final Assessment -Summative Assessment -Course evaluation survey  Course Objectives: -Learn to navigate and work cooperatively in this environment -Become familiar with the graphing calculator and its applications -Introduce and use basic trigonometry -Explore concepts of graphical analysis -Discuss basic skills and concepts used in statistics -Use concepts learned to solve practical applications -Learn what math classes you can expect to take in college.
__label__0 To understand and connect concepts of the calculus with real world problems and other scientific disciplines.  To value mathematics and develop an ability to communicate mathematics, both in writing and orally.  To develop mathematical reasoning, and an ability to solve problems.  To attain computational facility in integral calculus, and sequences and series.  WITHDRAWAL: The last day for undergraduates to withdraw from a full-session couse is Friday, March 8.  GRADING: Grades for 230 will be assigned on the basis of 650 points, as follows:  3 one-hour exams worth 100 points each  Quizzes and/or homework, 150 points total  Final exam, 200 points ADVICE: Perhaps the single most important factor in your success in this course is your study habits . Think of learning math as "working out" in the gym. Study at least 3 times per week; do not wait until the day before the exam. Learn mathematics like you would learn a language. Work on the concepts until they make sense. Don't just memorize facts and then forget them a few weeks later. You will need to know this stuff for Calc III and other courses. Master each homework problem - beyond just getting a correct answer. Be on the lookout for mistakes in algebra and trig. Always come to class! While you're there, listen, think, and ask questions.

__label__0 Math Anxiety  What is it?  Math anxiety has been defined as a feeling of tension and apprehension that arises when someone is faced with manipulating numbers and solving mathematical problems. It is not just associated with academic settings. It can show its ugly head in many ordinary life situations.  In academic settings, though, math anxiety can cause students to perform poorly on math tests, homework, and just in class generally. Very often, a studentís poor performance in a mathematics class is not just the result of a lack of knowledge. It can be tied to math anxiety as well. Someone with math anxiety is not mentally deficient. But, it can cause a student to lose focus and to lose confidence in mathematical situations, thus impacting future success in mathematical requirements.  What causes it?  Math is linear in nature. In most classes it is possible to skip one chapter and still understand the other material covered. Not so with mathematics. In this discipline a student must learn and understand a process before moving on to the next one. In other words, what you learn in Chapter One is the foundation of what will be taught in Chapter Two.  Math is like a language. It has many symbols that appear foreign until you really understand what each means. You canít expect to take Spanish, for example, one week and be fluent in it the next week. It is the same in mathematics. Practice makes perfect. Doing one or two homework problems is simply not enough practice to fully grasp the concepts covered in the chapter. Do all the problems assigned. Try doing a few of the ones not assigned, as well. You can be ďfluentĒ in math if you work at it.  Donít expect your college math classes to mirror those you had in high school. In a secondary setting, you went to math class every day and were saturated with the materials covered that semester. In college, however, you are expected to learn the same amount of material but in a shorter amount of time with less contact, often, with your instructor. What you had a year to learn in high school will now be covered in about 14 -16 weeks, and you are expected to fully understand it before exiting the class.  Remember, math requires a different mindset. In other classes you may just need to listen, take notes, and then learn the material without really applying what you learned. In math, you will be taking what you have learned and using it to solve equations or a set of problems.  Donít despair! You can do mathematics. In fact, you probably use more math daily than you realize. Balanced a checkbook lately? Doubled a recipe? If math begins to get you down, come to the Learning Assistance Center and let the tutors get you back on track. You can succeed in your math classes!  How do I know that I have Math Anxiety?  Ask yourself these questions:  1. Do I become anxious and forget important concepts during a math test?  2. Do I blame the instructor if I donít do well on math assignments and tests?  3. Do I stop taking notes in class when I get confused?  4. Am I afraid to ask questions in math class?  5. Do I stop working a problem as soon as I get stuck?  6. Do I feel like it is impossible for me to understand math?  If you answered ďyesĒ to several of them, then you probably do suffer from Math Anxiety.  Strategies for reducing math anxiety:  1. Go to every math class, without fail.  2. If you must miss a class, ask the instructor if you can attend another section so you can keep up with the work.  3. Make sure you read the text carefully. Donít skip over the explanations. They are there for a reason.  4. Try making a vocabulary list or an outline of the material in the chapter. Math does have its own vocabulary, and you need to be familiar with it.  5. Get tutoring as soon as you recognize a problem.  6. Always ask your instructor if you have a question about your assignment.  7. Copy everything on the board. Repeat the steps mentally and try to work the problem. Make note cards with the steps to remind yourself of the process to solve problems.  8. Study as soon as possible after your class. If you wait too long, you will forget what was covered in class. Try to make consistent study times at a point during the day when you are alert and focused. Have a set start and stop time and stick to it.  9. Find a place that is relatively free of distractions and make that your consistent place to study.  10. Turn off the phone, TV, and music while you study. It does make a difference.  11. Form a study group from your classmates. Make sure you choose students who are motivated and disciplined so you can support each other.  12. Donít study for extended periods. Take a break every 30 minutes or so.  13. If you are frustrated with a concept, stop. Get up. Get some fresh air. Come back to it in a few minutes when your mind is clear.  14. Watch the video tapes that accompany your text. You can find them in the LAC and in the library.  15. Do some math work every day.  16. Review your notes and homework before you go into class. That will give you a reference point when the instructor begins the lecture for that class session.

Calculus-style exercises at the beginning of the book have been revised to be more conceptual, emphasizing the same ideas, but at a higher level.  Theoretical exercises of medium difficulty have been added throughout the book.  New True/False questions in the first six chapters confront common misconceptions that students sometimes acquire at this level.  Content Updates  A new section 1.1, Introduction, combines introductory material that was previously scattered over several sections. This section includes two accessible examples about why proof is necessary and why we cannot always trust what we see.  The number of axioms has been reduced from four to three by introducing the Completeness Axiom first, and using it to prove the Well Ordering Principle and the Principle of Mathematical Induction.  The material on countable sets and inverse images of sets has been postponed to Chapter 3, making it possible to begin discussing limits of sequences even earlier than before.  Coverage of Taylor's Formula has been moved from Chapter 7 to Chapter 4 to offer another example of the utility of the Mean Value Theorem.  The Heine-Borel Theorem now has its own section and includes several exercises designed to give students practice in making a local condition on a compact set into a global one.  Section 12.1, Jordan regions, has been organized to simplify the presentation and make it easier to teach.  Features & benefits  Flexible presentation, with uniform writing style and notation, covers the material in small sections, allowing instructors to adapt this book to their syllabus.  The practical focus explains assumptions so that students learn the motivation behind the mathematics and are able to construct their own proofs.  Early introduction of the fundamental goals of analysis Refers and examines how a limit operation interacts with algebraic operation.  Optional appendices and enrichment sections enables students to understand the material and allows instructors to tailor their courses.  An alternate chapter on metric spaces allows instructors to cover either chapter independently without mentioning the other.  More than 200 worked examples and 600 exercises encourage students to test comprehension of concepts, while using techniques in other contexts.  Reorganized coverage of series separates series of constants and series of functions into separate chapters.  Consecutive numbering of theorems, definitions and remarks allows students and instructors to find citations easily.

__label__0 Suggested Project Topics  Here are a few ideas for project topics for final year, higher diploma, and Masters students. The only common thread is that they combine some mathematics with compuation.  1. Program a LEGO Robot using Matlab  The goal will be to learn how to programme real-time systems, model-based design, and develop object oriented Matlab code. These can be applied to contoling LEGO Mindstrom NXT robot.  2. The Singular Value Decomposition, and it's applications.  The singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important factorization of a matrix with interesting applications to a wide variety of areas such as image and signal processing, data compression, computational tomography, etc.. For one example of the the SVD can be applied to problems involving in face recognition, see Singular Value Decomposition, Eigenfaces, and 3D Reconstructions by Neil Muller, Lourenco Magaia, B.M. Herbst  You should consider this project if you like Linear Algebra. Some computing will be essential, but not necessarily anything too difficult.  3. Numerical Algorithms for Parallel Computers  Many classical numerical methods were designed for single-processor computers. Examples include Gaussian elimination or Numerical Integration. With the advent of parallel, multiprocessor and distributed systems, there is a need to revisit many of these methods and to see how they can be adapted for parallel computation.  A different example is Schwarz Methods for linear boundary value problems. These have existed for over 100 years, but are being ``rediscovered'' because they are so suitable for parallel computers  A project on this topic would mainly involve programming and algorithm design. Code could be tested on some Linux computers running software to emulate parallel and distributed systems.  The student who does this project should like programming. It would be useful to have studied numerical analysis.  4. Simulating Small-World Networks  Many networks that occur naturally have two properties: clustering and short average path-lengths. This is called the small world phenomenon and is related to research activities in very diverse areas. To verify this, check a web search engine for such topics as Six Degrees of Separation and The Kevin Bacon Game  A student working on this project will, at the very least, read a number of articles on the topic, learn enough mathematics to understand some of the theorems and conjectures in the area, and write some computer programs to simulate these networks.  The project would suit a student with interests in programming and graph theory. Some knowledge is stochastic processes and Markov chains would be useful.  5. Topics in Numerical Analysis  Numerical Analysis is the area of mathematics that is concerned with the design and analysis of methods and algorithms for obtaining useful solutions to mathematical problems. Two of the main sources of problems are differential equations and linear algebra. The applications are far too numerous to mention.  The interested student should browse a few books in the library. For example Afternotes on Numerical Analysis and Afternotes goes to Graduate School (G.W. Stewart), Introduction of Numerical Analysis (Stoer and Bulirish),  Depending on the students' interests, projects may have little or no computing aspects, or may be strongly focused on computational problems, or something in between.  6. Some topic of mutual interest  Why not come up with your own idea? A good place to start would be the Education articles in SIAM Review. Or you could go to the library and have a look at such titles as

__label__0 MATHEMATICS AT EUREKA  Mathematics, more than any other human endeavor, relies on deductive reasoning to produce new knowledge from the investigation of natural events, whether they occur in our immediate environment or in the immensity of space. It serves as a universal language which represents, interprets, and integrates all such knowledge.  The subject of mathematics is divided into algebra, geometry, analysis, and probability. Some of the concepts of each of these subdivisions are particularly useful in helping to discuss or solve problems in other fields. These concepts are frequently called Applied Mathematics.

__label__0 Saxon Algebra I textbook is designed to differ from a traditional textbook in three areas: (1) the text is organized into lessons to avoid the uneven or abrupt flow of material that can result when topics are organized into chapters, (2) Saxon uses an extensive conversational presentation of the material rather than charts and diagrams, and (3) only a small number of the exercises in each lesson are on the new material, the majority are practice and drill of previously presented concepts and skills.  Strategy: Graphing calculator Subjects: 294 pre-university Dutch students, 16-17 years old. Results: Students in the treatment group made significantly more use of graphical solutions than the students in the control group. Males used the graphing calculator significantly more than females. The graphing calculator had a positive effect on the weaker math students.  Description: This study utilized two experimental conditions and one control condition in a senior high mathematics classroom. Three classrooms used the graphing calculator throughout the year with all topics in their textbook. Five classrooms used the graphing calculator for only one topic for a two-month long implementation and four classrooms (control group) covered the topics in the textbook without using the graphing calculator Skills and concepts learned and applied using the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP) Advanced Algebra textbook Subjects: 306 students in heterogeneous classes studying second-year algebra in four high schools. The high schools selected were in a White middle-class suburb of Atlanta, a rural area that is becoming a suburb of Chicago, a small semi-rural community in Mississippi, and an affluent suburb of Philadelphia. Of the students, 19% were in Grade 10, 76% in Grade 11, and 5% in Grade 12. Additionally, 84% were Caucasian, 3% African American, 1% Hispanic, while the remainder were classified as other or unknown. Results: Students using the UCSMP curriculum significantly outperformed students in the comparison curriculum (p=0.0014) on all items of the post-test. However, analysis of the items all students in the study had the opportunity to learn did not indicate a significant difference (p=0.108). Performance on the eight skill items in this last analysis was comparable for the two curricula.  Description: UCSMP is a curriculum that uses reading and problem solving, realistic applications, technology (graphing calculators and/or computers), a multidimensional approach understanding, and an instructional format featuring continual review combined with a modified mastery-learning strategy. It emphasizes understanding of concepts through multiple representations, realistic contexts, and the use of technology. There is less emphasis on skills than in a traditional curriculum. The instructional method often uses small-group explorations and extended projects, both involving writing about mathematics Webb.  The impact of the Interactive Mathematics Program on student learning teachSubjects: Eighty volunteer students with lower-middle to middle SES status enrolled in a college algebra course.  Results: Treatment subjects achieved gains in the concepts of modeling, translating, and interpreting as they relate to functions. There was no significant difference in groups in regard to the concept of reification.  Description: CIA teaches college algebra using computer technology and with a focus on real-world situations.  Results: No attempt was made to verify the comparability of the treatment and control groups prior to performing the experiment, therefore, although students in the treatment group outscored the control group, it is not possible to meaningfully attribute these gains to the intervention.  Description: This strategy employs an algebra text written to provide continuous review of four or five problem sets for each fundamental part of a skill. Each problem set has only four or five problems on the new facet of the skill and approximately twenty review problems of prior facts or skills. This method provides the student a longer period of time in which to learn a skill or develop a concept • Number & Operations  Math Topic(s): Computation and concepts/application skills.  9th to 12th grade.  (Also in Diverse Learners)  Study: Austin.  An experimental study of the effects of three instructional methods in basic probability and statistics.  Strategy: The use of manipulatives and pictorial modes. Subjects: Freshman and sophomore students (n=71) at Purdue University who did not major in science or mathematics. Results: Computational achievement did not differ among the three different methods. Using pictorial figures improved students' achievement, but there was no significant difference as a result of using manipulatives.  Description: Students were divided into three different treatment groups; manipulative-pictorial (MP); pictorial (P); and symbolic (S). The MP group manipulated such things as coins, dice, random-number tables, and marble-selection devices and used graphs, diagrams, and figures for the pictorial portion of the experiment. The P group looked at the data from the experiments and the same pictorial elements of the MP group. The S group used no pictorial aids; only mathematical symbols and words were used confront  Math Topic(s): Computation and concepts/application skills.  9th to 12th grade.

Strategy: Individualized instruction with the Geometry Proof Tutor (GPTutor) Subjects: Geometry students from a public high school: 10 students from one gifted class, 18 students from one scholars class, and 9 students from each of three regular classes. Racially mixed and with a wide range of socioeconomic statuses. Results: All experimental groups outperformed the control group on the posttest:  Description: The Geometry Proof Tutor is a computer-based tutoring software for proof construction that provides individualized instruction. It is composed of the following three components: 1. Expert: embodies the knowledge (i.e. theorems, axioms, and definitions) necessary for successfully solving problems. 2. Tutor: contains information that is used to tutor students with messages about students' errors and strategies to attack problems; and 3. Interface: presents students with problems and handles students' input tutorsStrategy: Conceptually Oriented Instruction Subjects: Two ninth grade general math classes from a Midwest suburban high school with a population of 700 students. Subject students ranged from 14-17 years old. The average age was 15 years old. First semester: the "conceptually oriented" class had 28 students and the "computational" class had 19 students. Second semester: the "conceptually oriented" class had 23 students and the "computational" class had 21 students. Results: Students in the conceptually oriented class outperformed students in the drill and practice class on a test of computation. Effect Size = +0.96.  Description: Conceptually oriented instruction focuses on estimation, mental arithmetic, whole number concepts and relationships, and arithmetic word problems. It examines set, region, and linear models for fractions (as a part of a whole), and the connections between fractions, decimals, and percents. The intervention uses calculators, manipulatives, models, and illustrations. It employs questioning strategies and encourages student communication

__label__0 The Basics of Algebra  Before you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.  One of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.  Another important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.  Exponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.  Understanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1. Without understanding the distributive property, you will find yourself completely lost in a lot of common situations that come up. The distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.  Order of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.  The Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.  Variables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.  Exponents – Just like multiplication is repeated addition, exponents allow us to use a shorthand for repeated multiplication.  Percentages – Having an even ground for comparison between different amounts is a critical skill.

__label__0 Secondary Mathematics III [2011]  Create equations that describe numbers or relationships. For A.CED.1, use all available types of functions to create such equations, including root functions, but constrain to simple cases. While functions used in A.CED.2, 3, and 4 will often be linear, exponential, or quadratic the types of problems should draw from more complex situations than those addressed in Mathematics I. For example, finding the equation of a line through a given point perpendicular to another line allows one to find the distance from a point to a line. Note that the example given for A.CED.4 applies to earlier instances of this standard, not to the current course.  Mathematical Modeling A.CED.1 - A.CED.4 Curriculum Guide The Utah State Office of Education (USOE) and educators around the state of Utah developed these guides for the Secondary Mathematics III Cluster "Create Equations that Describe Numbers or Relationships" / Standards A.CED.1, A.CED.2, A.CED.3 and A.CED.4.

__label__0 Rate of change Teacher Resources  Title  Resource Type  Views  Grade  Rating  Math pupils calculate the average rate of change over a specific interval. They represent the average rate of change on a graph and examine the behavior of the graph for decreasing and increasing numerals.  In this function instructional activity, students read word problems and write functions. They determine the instantaneous rate of change and identify intervals. This three-page instructional activity contains approximately 20 problems.  High schoolers investigate logistic models by making a scatter plot of internet phone users over 5 years. They find a logistic model that fits their data and then discuss what the instantaneous rate of change means in the context of the problem. Very relevant and applicable!  In this calculus worksheet, students problem solve 8 word problems involving rates of change in association with high school students. Students work out each problem and give a short explanation of each answer.  Students, with the assistance of their TI-84 Plus / TI-83 Plus calculators, distinguish meanings from right, left and symmetric difference quotients that include rate of change and graphical interpretations. They utilize symmetric difference quotients to approximate instantaneous rate of changes.  For this calculus worksheet, 12th graders differentiate and integrate basic trigonometric functions, calculate rates of change, and integrate by substitution and by parts. The twenty-two page worksheet contains explanation of the topic, numerous worked examples, and sixteen multi-part practice problems. Answers are not provided.  In this successive approximations activity, students use the Babylonian algorithm to determine the roots of given numbers. They identify the limits of a function, and compute the rate of change in a linear function. This two-page activity contains explanations, examples, and approximately ten problems.  Students calculate the rate of change using the derivative. In this algebra lesson plan, students identify the function over closed interval and identify the rate of change. They use correct notation and classify a function as increasing or decreasing.  Learners explore the concept of rate of change. In this rate of change lesson, students calculate concentrations, flow, and duration of ice water. Learners calculate and graph temperature over time of the ice water. Students analyze the rate of change.
__label__0 ESSENTIAL MATH W/APPL (8TH 10)  by BARKER  Annotated Instructor Edition  Our Price:  $28.51  Rent  Our Price:  $18.67  Term:  Description  As in previous editions, the focus in ESSENTIAL MATHEMATICS with APPLICATIONS remains on the Aufmann Interactive Method (AIM). Students are encouraged to be active participants in the classroom and in their own studies as they work through the How To examples and the paired Examples and You Try It problems. The role of "active participant" is crucial to success. Presenting students with worked examples, and then providing them with the opportunity to immediately work similar problems, helps them build their confidence and eventually master the concepts. To this point, simplicity plays a key factor in the organization of this edition, as in all other editions. All lessons, exercise sets, tests, and supplements are organized around a carefully-constructed hierarchy of objectives. This "objective-based" approach not only serves the needs of students, in terms of helping them to clearly organize their thoughts around the content, but instructors as well, as they work to design syllabi, lesson plans, and other administrative documents. The Eighth Edition features a new design, enhancing the Aufmann Interactive Method and the organization of the text around objectives, making the pages easier for both students and instructors to follow.

Instant feedback and automatic grading by Maple give you more time to teach and help you be more effective in the classroom.  First course for undergraduate students, this book aims to present the fundamentals of linear algebra in the clearest possible way; pedagogies eg. more basic applications, section-end Concept Review, True/false exercises are the main considerations. Calculus and technology are not a prerequisite but included for further exploration. A concluding chapter covers 20 applications of linear algebra drawn from various disciplines.  This revision of the market-leading text maintains its classic strengths: a contemporary approach with flexible chapter construction, clear exposition, and outstanding problems. Written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, it focuses both on theory and practical applications with current examples of Differential Equations as they apply to engineering and the sciences.  A first course in differential equations, it emphasizes a systems approach and integrates the use of modern computing technology in the context of contemporary applications from engineering and science. Section exercises give hands-on experience in modeling, analysis, and computer experimentation. Optional projects provide additional opportunities to explore the role played by differential equations of a more serious nature.  Written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, this book sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications.  For a first course in differential equations, this book is intended for science and engineering majors who have completed the calculus sequence, but not necessarily a first course in linear algebra. It emphasizes a systems approach and integrates the use of modern computing technology in the context of contemporary applications from engineering and science. It emphasizes contemporary applications to a greater extent and makes somewhat more use of graphs.
__label__0 In the words of the author: Before writing my algebra series, it was painfully apparent that my students couldn't relate to the applications in the course. I was plagued with the question, "What is this good for?" To try to bridge that gap, I wrote some labs, which facilitated my students in collecting data, finding models via curve fitting, and using the models to make estimates and predictions. My students really loved working with the current, compelling, and authentic data and experiencing how mathematics truly is useful. My students' response was so strong that I decided to write an algebra series. Little did I know that to realize this goal, I would need to embark on a 15-year challenging journey, but the rewards of hearing such excitement from students and faculty across the country has made it all worthwhile! I'm proud to have played even a small role in raising peoples' respect and enthusiasm for mathematics. I have tried to honor my inspiration: by working with authentic data, students can experience the power of mathematics. A random-sample study at my college suggests that I am achieving this goal. The study concludes that students who used my series were more likely to feel that mathematics would be useful in their lives (P-value 0.0061) as well as their careers (P-value 0.024). In addition to curve fitting, my approach includes other types of meaningful modeling, directed-discovery explorations, conceptual questions, and of course, a large bank of skill problems. The curve-fitting applications serve as a portal for students to see the usefulness of mathematics so that they become fully engaged in the class. Once involved, they are more receptive to all aspects of the course.
__label__0 Why study calculus? Is it because you want to be a doctor, an engineer, a forensic scientist, a biologist, or a mathematician? Or is it because someone told you that it would be "good for you"? Well, all of those are certainly legitimate reasons. But if you aren't quite sure "Why calculus?" here is another reason: It is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind, and, even more to the point, it is easily accessible to anyone who already has studied algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.  Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton independently invented Calculus. Although the notation, terminology, and rigor may have changed or been standardized over the years, the concepts that we will study have not changed fundamentally since the work of the co-inventors in the 17th century.  We will begin Calculus with the study of Rates of Change and what are called derivatives. Rates of Change are all around us. For example, velocity is the rate of change of distance with respect to time; and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. So, we experience derivatives every time we ride in a car, or fly in an airplane. Calculus can also be used to compute areas and volumes of odd shapes with what are known as integrals. Thus, calculus has a place in architecture too.  That calculus is important in real-world applications is not in dispute. In fact, there are so many applications of calculus that studying it really is "good for you." Besides engaging in a worthwhile intellectual endeavor, you will be helping to keep your future career options open. That, from a practical point of view, is not a bad reason at all.  Moreover, studying calculus can be a lot of fun, but we will let you be the judge of that.  How to study calculus. Calculus has a lot of rules. We admit it! Find the derivative of this function, or the integral of that. However, you should train yourself to keep the rules in perspective: Always put the concepts first. When you study a given calculus concept, ask yourself three questions:  What is the picture (a graph or sketch) that I should have in mind?  What is the theorem or formula that gives a statement of the concept?  Do I know how to use the concept in different situations and with different numbers?  The above is what we might call "high-level thinking." It provides a way for you to stay oriented, to know what you are learning, and for what purpose. The rest is in the details, important though they are. The combined process is a lot like using a map to hike through the woods. Yes, you have to look at individual trees and their proximity to local landmarks to find your way, but you always want to keep the map and a compass handy to give an overview of the whole trip. So it goes with the study of calculus concepts. Always know where you are going, the direction to take to get there, and how to accomplish the task. The proof, though, is in getting there!  Practice, practice, practice. In the end, there is no other way. You cannot learn calculus by reading about it. You have to take a pencil and paper and work problems. Learning calculus, or mathematics in general, is a participatory activity. You have to do it to learn it, to make it your own.  Using Calculus on Demand to study calculus.  The Index page of COD (i.e., the page you see when you go to the web site with your Browser) has a picture of a Leibniz Wheel in the upper left-hand corner. Click on the Leibniz Wheel to find out what it is, and how it represents our philosophy of combining theory with practice in the study of calculus in a computing environment.  COD is a Calculus I course that gives an introduction to differential and integral Calculus that comprises roughly to the AB part of the AP exam. You will find the topics listed in the green left-hand sidebar of the COD index page. Clicking on a topic will take you to the Lecture-page on that topic.  Lecture pages: All the Lecture pages have the same layout. There is a short statement of the main thrust of the lecture, followed by these items:  Quick Question: This section is intended to get you thinking about the topic. Sometimes you can answer this question before studying the material of the Lecture, other times not. If you have answered the question, you can check its correctness by clicking Answer. If you don't think you know the answer to the Quick Question, it is better to wait and try the question again after you have studied the Textbook section, which should allow you to answer the question. As before you then can check the correctness of your answer by clicking Answer.  Textbook: Here you will find a link to on-line material from a textbook. At present, we are using the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. When you click on the topic in the Textbook section of the Lecture page, you will get a list of the material from the sections of this book corresponding to the COD topics. If you click a topic, you will launch an Acrobat Reader pdf file that will display the text on-line. You can open the link for the Lecture you are working on or for any other topic if there is something you have forgotten and want to review, or if you want to peek ahead. The textbook material will open in a separate window so that you can leave it open on your desktop while you are going through the rest of the lecture.  Today's Homework: The link here will take you to the WeBWorK login page. If you do not have a password, you can sign in as a practice user with practice1 as both the user name and password. If "practice1" is in use, try practice2, or practice3, etc. until you find one that is not in use. After logging in, you will see a page that has the option to "Begin Problem Sets." After selecting it, you will see a list of homework sets that are listed by day. For example, the homework set "Setm3f02day04" corresponds to the homework for COD Lecture 4. Similarly, "Setm3f02day13" is the homework for COD Lecture 13. Ignore the fact that the sets all say "CLOSED;" this just means that the answers are available, and that WeBWorK will not retain your answer once you log off. However, by choosing a problem set and "getting a problem" you may input your answers and WeBWorK will tell you if you are right or wrong. You could also get a copy of the problem set (in pdf).  You may not want to do the homework until you have looked at some Examples and tried the on-line Quiz. This will be true if you are studying the material for the first time. In that case, you should look at the Examples, take the Quiz, and review the Textbook material as necessary before turning to the homework exercises. For those students who have seen the material before, there is nothing wrong with going directly to the homework. You can always come back later to the examples and quiz as needed.  Quiz  : The quiz consists of a set of problems that come up in their own window. You can work out the answers on paper and check them by looking at the COD answers on-line.  Examples: Here you can find examples of problems and their step-by-step solutions on-line.  Applets: These carry out little computer programs that illustrate a calculus idea or provide a tool to implement a calculus procedure. Look at and experiment with them. They are meant to help you learn the material better, or to function much like advanced calculators. Don't be shy. Have fun with them.  Videos: Click on a video to see a calculus problem being worked out by real people. Be on the lookout for Dartmouth graduate students, faculty, and undergraduates. So far, there have been no lucrative film contracts in the offing, but who knows? How long did it take Matt Damon to be discovered?  Lecture-page sidebar: The green sidebar on the left contains links to several resources. First, there is a link to the Math 3 Course Home Page. Math 3 is the Dartmouth course for which COD is the on-line version. The Math 3 Home Page talks about all of the issues relevant to a student taking the course on campus in that particular term. We thought you might be interested. The next link on the COD sidebar gives the Syllabus for that offering of Math 3. The day-by-day syllabus corresponds to the layout of the Lectures in COD. Be careful, though, and don't be misled. If you are studying calculus on your own it may take more than one day to master the material of a given lecture: having a real live teacher does make a difference!  There is also a link to past Math 3 exams (covering Lectures 1-10, 11-19; and the course final). This link is called Practice Exams and should be used as such to test your understanding of blocks of the COD Lectures. There is also a Textbook Home Page link to the home page of the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. Here you will find section-pages that give links to calculus resources on the World Wide Web. And finally, there is a link to the Post a Comment page that we discuss below.  What do you do if you have a problem? If you are studying calculus in a classroom setting, you can talk to other students or to the teacher. However, if you are studying on your own, you can Post a Comment using the bottom link on the green sidebar of a lecture-page. There you can communicate with other students who also are studying calculus on-line. You could either state your problem and ask for help, or you may find that someone has already answered that or a similar question. You may even find questions that you can answer for other students. We encourage you to look at the Post a Comment section of COD on a regular basis.

__label__0 Undergraduate linear algebra is both beautiful and replete with real world applications and connections to the rest of mathematics. The purpose of the present volume is to enrich the understanding of linear algebra for a wide audience by placing a broad collection of short items in the hands of teachers, students, and others who enjoy the subject. Because undergraduate linear algebra is so fundamental to the mathematics curriculum, it is often taught by non-specialists and specialists alike. "Linear Algebra Gems" offers to all teachers clever ways in which core ideas can be presented to their students.  Most articles are accessible to those with modest preparation in linear algebra, including beginning students. However, many items will also contain pleasant surprises even to those well-versed in the subject. The editors have combed through the literature, and have selected from original submissions, to find expository articles and problems to enrich the reader's understanding. The seventy-three articles selected are organized into nine sections, with over 120 problems grouped into subject categories as a tenth section.  Contributors to the volume include experts in the field and long-time teachers of linear algebra. The book was prepared as part of a broad contract with the National Science Foundation to improve undergraduate linear algebra education. The editors hope that many readers will find enjoyment from this collection. [via]  More editions of Linear Algebra Gems: Assets for Undergraduate Mathematics:  Linear algebra and matrix theory have long been fundamental tools in mathematical disciplines as well as fertile fields for research. In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. The book should be welcomed by graduate students and researchers in a variety of mathematical fields both as an advanced text and as a modern reference work. [via]

__label__0 Main menu  Boletin UAL: Online Mathematical Project  Submitted by Boletin on Sun, 02/19/2012 - 10:54  Optional Abstract:  The project we present here is an online free journal on the spreading of Mathematics ( mainly addressed to secondary school students, although also appropriate for a broader audience. It is a local action of the University of Almería (Spain) to promote Mathematics among secondary school students and to strengthen relationships with their Math teachers. Our leitmotiv is to provide a closer, more objective, real and positive image of mathematics and help to improve its perception and assessment. This project also includes visits to secondary schools, where the prize of the journal's mathematical contest is awarded to the winner and talks on popularization of Maths are delivered. The journal, created in 2007, is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course, and its length is around 20-25 pages. More than 30 persons are involved in its edition. Last year we had around 115,000 visits and more than 45,000 downloads.  In Spain, it is well known that secondary school students' motivation to study Science (especially Mathematics) is not very strong. This is a common problem to almost all Europe. Spanish and Andalusian governments have general policies on education to promote the study of Science. They are necessary and convenient. However, we think that local actions in the students' environment, which supplement these policies, are also needed. For this reason, five years ago we founded at the University of Almería an online free journal called Boletín de la Titulación de Matemáticas de la UAL ( mainly addressed to those students. Our intention is to stimulate their interest in mathematics, to develop their mathematical skills, to complement their background, and to improve their perception and assessment of mathematics. Many aspects, usually out of the syllabus, are treated to provide a closer, more real and positive image of mathematics. Another aim is to encourage a closer contact between secondary schools and our university. Although these are our main goals, we do not discard a broader audience and often include articles appropriate for a general public. It is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc. We do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country. Boletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world. This project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system. There are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools. The secondary school students are, as said, the main target of this project, and they can participate through the mathematical contest that we pose. There exists a closer contact later in the prize award ceremony at the winner's secondary school. In such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers. No doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience. Regarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called "Territorio Estudiante" (Student Area). The journal is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course (October, January and April). Its length is around 20-25 pages and papers published must be short and suitable for a secondary school level. It is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:  Interviews, mathematical activities, and news.  From Secondary School to University, containing teaching experiences, learning Maths in a foreign language, solutions to the university entrance exam Maths problems, etc.  A mathematical contest for secondary school students.  Mathematical spreading, including short articles about History of Mathematics, applications of Mathematics, Women and Mathematics, Culture and Mathematics, etc. Books and web pages reviews about Mathematics popularization appear here as well. Mathematical quotations and puzzles are also included.  Student area, made itself by our undergraduate students and where, among other things, they speak about their experiences with mathematical studies and activities and interview Erasmus students and alumni.  The editorial committee consists of 3 main editors and 29 section editors, composed by professors of the University of Almería and teachers from secondary schools of our province, and 4 undergraduate students in charge of the student area. Although our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province. For example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues. To spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes. Several facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect. We are very interested in knowing if our efforts to bring the Mathematics closer to young people and teachers in schools are useful. Among the methods to know this we use:  Appearance in the local newspapers to achieve more social relevance (see the additional documentation).  Number of visits that we pay to secondary schools and feedback from them since this quantity points out the interest that the Boletín arouses.  Recognition by the local academic authorities. In 2011, we received the award for Excellence in Teaching Innovation.  In conclusion, with the invaluable help of our journal we have set up a reliable atmosphere between professors from our university and teachers from secondary schools in our region of influence. This has permitted to develop other activities jointly such as meetings about mathematical education (I Jornada del Profesorado de Almería,  or the group Almería Matemática in Facebook. Our Maths students at the university benefited from this and there is a growing interest among secondary school students in studying the degree in Mathematics at the University of Almería.

The field of Linear Algebra is more beautiful and more fundamental than its rather dull name may suggest. More beautiful because it is full of powerful ideas that are quite unlike those normally emphasized in a linear algebra course in a mathematics department.  Throughout the book the author follows the practice of first presenting required background material, which is then used to develop the results. The book is divided in ten chapters.

__label__0 Search Loci: Convergence:In J. R. Newman (ed.), The World of Mathematics, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1956.  The Unique Effects of Including History in College Algebra  The Modules (2)  Introduction to Polynomials: Looks at the efforts put forth in finding zeros of polynomials and includes a brief introduction to the lives of Niels Henrik Abel and Evariste Galois. This historical module excerpt illustrates the difficulties Abel and Galois had in breaking into the mathematical circles of their time. "Niels Henrik Abel, at the age of sixteen, proved that a general formula for solving a quintic (fifth degree) polynomial did not exist…. However, since he was largely self taught, leading mathematicians in Paris, such as Cauchy, largely ignored him… Evariste Galois had equally important discoveries. At sixteen, Galois had the desire to enter the most prestigious engineering school of the day, the École Polytechnique… [W]hen Galois submitted a paper to the school as part of the admission process, Cauchy lost the paper. He attended another school for the purpose of training to become a teacher. However, he kept his mathematical studies up and submitted a second paper to the École Polytechnique. This paper also appears to have been lost." (Hagerty and Smith, 2006).  Polynomials: Looks at theoretical methods to help find zeros of polynomials. The module looks at Horner's method and how information traveled in eras prior to modern-day technology. It includes a discussion of the difficulty of crediting the correct civilization with the development of a topic as it is believed that Horner did not develop the method credited to him; in fact, the Ancient Chinese knew of this method (Eves, 1992).  Technology: Looks at methods to use technology to find zeros of polynomials, and discusses the rapid changes in technology. The goal is to have the students take a look at when the Internet was developed and realize that instant messages were not always possible. The students need to realize that their parents enjoyed "Pong" and "Pacman" and their grandparents had the radio. Thus, the students need to revaluate the question "My parents didn't need math, why do I?"

__label__0 The elementary school curriculum in recent years has begun to include a significant amount of geometry, including reasoning about important and fundamental ideas.This course is designed to provide students intending to become elementary school teachers with the beginnings of a strong background to teach this geometry.  While the geometry topics will be basic, the course will go into them deeply.There is much to think about in considering basic geometry ideas. Since the course will emphasize understanding, reasoning, and communication, class discussion and writing will be key components of the course.  Because this course is for future elementary teachers, few of whom are math majors, the course will be designed to be friendly and accessible to students who have not been in a math course recently.The subject matter lends itself to visual and hands-on approaches, and these will be utilized fully.  As suggested above, there will regular writing, projects and some assigned readings beyond the textbook.Because of the importance of reasoning and communication, in-class work will be essential. In particular, attendance at all of every (or almost every) class is required. If you will miss all or part of class on a regular basis, you should not take this course.  Since this is a Credit/No Credit course on topics in elementary mathematics, one might assume that this would be an easy course, especially if one has a strong math background.On the contrary, to get Credit in the course, a student must achieve a satisfactory level in all components of the course, including writing and classroom participation.So the course will demand a significant and consistent amount of work from everyone, whatever her/his math background.On the positive side, consistent serious work should suffice for a Credit grade, even if a student brings a weaker math background.  There will be some tests and also a final exam at the regularly scheduled time, but it will not be the conventional sort of exam.  Note that this is a content course, not a methods course. While we will aim to model good teaching techniques, we will be addressing mainly questions of mathematical content, not methods for teaching elementary school students. If you enter the Teacher Education Program in the UW College of Education, you will take a methods course on teaching elementary mathematics.
__label__0 Cover  Title Page  Copyright  PREFACE  Linear algebra is now included in the undergraduate curriculum of most universities. It is generally recognized that this branch of algebra, being less abstract and directly motivated by geometry, is easier to understand than some other branches and that because of the wide applications it should be taught as early as possible. The ...  CONTENTS  CHAPTER I. LINEAR SPACE  In the euclidean plane E, we choose a fixed point 0 as the origin, and consider the set X of arrows or vectors in E with the common initial point 0 . A vector a in E with initial point 0 and endpoint A is by definition the ordered pair (O, A ) of points. The vector a = ( 0 , A) can be regarded as a graphical representation of a force acting at the ...  CHAPTER II. LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS  At the beginning of the last chapter, we gave a brief description of abstract algebra as the mathematical theory of algebraic systems and, in particular, linear algebra as the mathematical theory of linear spaces. These descriptions are incomplete, for we naturally want to find relations among the algebraic systems in question. In other ...  CHAPTER III. AFFINE GEOMETRY  To define the basic notions of geometry, we can follow the so called synthetic approach by postulating geometric objects (e.g. points, lines and planes) and geometric relations (e.g. incidence and betweenness) as primitive undefined concepts and proceed to build up the geometry from a number of axioms which are postulated to ...  CHAPTER IV. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY  In order to have a concise theory without all these awkward exceptions, we can - and this is a crucial step towards projective geometry - extend the plane A (and similarly the plane A') by the adjunction of a set of new points called points at infinity. More precisely, we understand by a point at infinity of A the direction ...  CHAPTER V. MATRICES  This therefore suggests the notion of a matrix as a doubly indexed family of scalars. Matrices are one of the most important tools in the study of linear transformations on finite-dimensional linear spaces. However, we need not overestimate their importance in the theory of linear algebra since the matrices play for the linear transformations ...  CHAPTER VI. MULTILINEAR FORMS  Linear transformations studied in Chapter II are, by definition, vector-valued functions of one vector variable satisfying a certain algebraic requirement called linearity. When we try to impose similar conditions on vector-valued functions of two (or more) vector variables, two different points of view are open to us. To be ...  CHAPTER VII. EIGENVALUES  Given a single endomorphism o of a finite-dimensional linear space X, it is desirable to have a base of X relative to which the matrix of o takes up a form as simple as possible. We shall see in this chapter that some endomorphisms can be represented (relative to certain bases) by matrices of diagonal form; while for every ...  CHAPTER VIII. INNER PRODUCT SPACES  We began in Chapter I by considering certain properties of vectors in the ordinary plane. Then we used the set V2 of all such vectors together with the usual addition and multiplication as a prototype linear space to define general linear spaces. So far we have entirely neglected the metric aspect of the linear space V2 ; this means that

__label__0 logarithmic function A function which acts on its argument with a logarithm. matrix A rectangular array of, usually, real or complex numbers, organized into rows and columns. When specifying the size of a matrix, the number of rows is stated first. For example, here is a 2 by 4 real matrix:  The numbers in a matrix are called entries, and are specified by the row and then column in which they appear. In the example above, for instance, A1,2 is the entry in the first row and second column, i.e. 4.98. Two matrices of the same size (with the same number of rows and columns) can be added componentwise, that is (A + B)i, j = Ai, j + Bi, j. Matrix multiplication is a little more complicated. A matrix M can be multiplied on the right by another matrix T only if T has the same number of rows as M has columns, and the result will have as many rows as M and as many columns as T. The entry of M T appearing in row i and column j is the sum of the pairwise products of the entries in row i of M and column j of T. In other words, if M is an n by m matrix, T must be an m by l matrix, and  Notice that this operation is not, in general, commutative. A matrix that has the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix, and these are particularly interesting as they can be added and multiplied, and the results will have the same dimensions. The most standard use of matrices is to represent linear operators, but they have a wide variety of other uses, and are interesting to study in their own right. Matrices can have a large number of different types of entries, including various kinds of numbers, elements of abstract fields and other algebraic structures, functions, and so forth. monotone function Also called monotonic function.

__label__0 Sign in to YouTube   It's all about computers: when they do the calculating, people can work on harder questions, try more concepts, and play with a multitude of new ideas. Conrad Wolfram discusses a new project to build a completely new math curriculum with computer-based computation at its heart - alongside a campaign to refocus math education away from historical hand-calculating techniques and toward relevant and conceptually interesting topics.  Presented at the Learning Without Frontiers Conference, January 25th 2012, London  So are you saying that applied maths should be taught at schools? Well, applied maths is basically engineering, computer science, actuarial studies, etc. which are specialized fields and more suitable to be studied at university. If you teach applied maths to student, they won't have the skills to do the problems. I believe that maths at school should be pure maths with an emphasis on rigor, problem solving and understanding so students can make use of the maths in university.  Sign in to YouTube  Um,.. Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, both people that were only able to ASK QUESTIONS in mathematics due to their deep understanding in maths. Thus deep understanding was only caused by learning maths. How else is someone meant to learn maths. We must be able to tackle completely theoretical problems before we are good enough to tackle real life problems  Sign in to YouTube  One thing which does not necessarily include computation or at least complex computation is mathematical proof. Something like a proof module might go well with these proposals, especially to teach the understanding of mathematical concepts.

Review '!even at this early stage (only a week in) I have been really impressed with the scheme so far. Our NQTs love the lesson plans and say they really help with ideas and with them finding out what sort of level to teach a topic. The lower set pupils love the workbooks, and they have been a great motivator. The books are clear and easy to read and are excellent practise for filling in SATs papers. Our only problem is that we struggle to get them to stop working and move on to their next lesson! We had a very heated discussion with one Year 9 boy who was insisting that he took his book home to carry on, and was very angry when we said he couldn't take it home! These pupils who are usually fairly unmotivated are working through at a real pace.'

__label__0 In 1821, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) published a textbook, the Cours d'analyse, to accompany his course in analysis at the Ecole Polytechnique. It is one of the most influential mathematics books ever written. Not only did Cauchy provide a workable definition of limits and a means to make them the basis of a rigorous theory of calculus, but he also revitalized the idea that all mathematics could be set on such rigorous foundations. Today, the quality of a work of mathematics is judged in part on the quality of its rigor, and this standard is largely due to the transformation brought about by Cauchy and the Cours d'analyse. For this translation, the authors have also added commentary, notes, references, and an index.

The American Diploma Project (ADP) benchmarks outline a progression of mathematics content for the Elementary Grades K-6 and Secondary Grades 7-12 to ensure that students master the content needed to succeed in college and careers.  The Society was founded in 1888 to further mathematical research and scholarship. AMS promotes mathematical research and its uses, strengthens mathematical education, and fosters awareness and appreciation of mathematics and its connections to other disciplines and to everyday life. Programs and services include meetings and conferences, support for Young Scholars programs and the Mathematical Moments program of the Public Awareness Office, resources for researchers and authors, and a Washington office that connects the mathematical community with the broader scientific community and with decision-makers who determine science funding. In addition, the site provides links to mathematics articles such as Professional Development of Mathematics Teachers.  CBMS is an umbrella organization consisting of seventeen professional societies, all of which have as one of their primary objectives the increase or diffusion of knowledge in one or more of the mathematical sciences. Its purpose is to promote understanding and cooperation among these national organizations so that they work together and support each other in their efforts to promote research, improve education, and expand the uses of mathematics. The group serves as a point of representation for the mathematical sciences to government agencies, other professional societies, and private foundations. Other activities include convening forums for the discussion of issues of broad concern to the mathematical sciences community such as the National Mathematics Advisory Panel Forum held in October 2008.  The mission of the MAA is to advance the mathematical sciences, especially at the collegiate level. Core interests of the group include: 1) supporting mathematical education and learning by encouraging effective curriculum, teaching, and assessment at all levels; 2) supporting research and scholarship; 3) providing professional development that fosters scholarship, professional growth, and cooperation among teachers, other professionals, and students; 4) influencing institutional and public policy through advocacy for the importance, uses, and needs of the mathematical sciences; and 5) promoting the general understanding and appreciation of mathematics. MAA encourages students of all ages, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to pursue activities and careers in the mathematical sciences.  The U.S. Department of Education Mathematics and Science Partnerships program funds professional development activities intended to increase the academic achievement of students in mathematics and science by enhancing the content knowledge and teaching skills of classroom teachers. Partnerships between high-need school districts and the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in institutions of higher education are at the core of these improvement efforts. Other partners may include state education agencies, public charter schools or other public schools, businesses, and nonprofit or for-profit organizations concerned with mathematics and science education.  MSRI's mission is the advancement and communication of fundamental knowledge in mathematics and the mathematical sciences, to the development of human capital for the growth and use of such knowledge, and to the cultivation in the larger society of awareness and appreciation of the beauty, power, and importance of mathematical ideas and ways of understanding the world. From its beginning in 1982, the Institute has been primarily funded by the NSF with additional support from other government agencies, private foundations, and academic and corporate sponsors. This site provides links to workshops, streaming video, and other algebra-related resources, including workshop lectures by Hung-Hsi Wu on the topics of The Mathematics K-12 Teachers Need to Know and Preparing Teachers to Teach Algebra.  NAGB was created by Congress in 1988 to formulate policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The Governing Board monitors external contracts; prepares and recommends procedures for reporting and disseminating NAEP results; reviews and recommends test content for NAEP; and recommends policies to guide other NAEP activities. Among the Governing Board's responsibilities are developing objectives and test specifications and designing the assessment methodology for NAEP. The Mathematics Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress describes a design for the main NAEP assessments at the national, state, and district levels, including mathematics content and types of assessment questions.  NCSM is a mathematics leadership organization for educational leaders, which provides professional learning opportunities necessary to support and sustain improved student achievement. NCSM envisions a professional and diverse learning community of educational leaders that ensures every student in every classroom has access to effective mathematics teachers, relevant curricula, culturally responsive pedagogy, and current technology.

__label__0 Math  The Connected Mathematics Program (CMP2) used by the sixth and seventh grades and the College Preparatory Mathematics (CPM) algebra I curriculum used by the eighth grade are rich with areas inviting additional insights and open to diverse methods of problem-solving, creating an open-ended structure that is more permissive of individual differences. While much of the content of these programs is parallel to that of standard middle school textbooks, how students learn and the role of the teacher in their learning may be significantly different.  Our mathematics courses support a philosophy of teaching and learning in which the teacher is a facilitator of learning rather than a dispenser of knowledge, and the students are active participants in constructing and explaining mathematics. Activities promote mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and communication skills. Students work in small and large groups as well as individually to explore concepts, make conjectures, and form generalizations. They learn to respect and value other opinions as they create and eagerly present a variety of approaches and solutions to problems. In so doing, students have an opportunity to experience mathematics in meaningful and challenging ways while obtaining a solid conceptual basis for further study in mathematics.  The CMP series in both sixth and seventh grade consists of several units, each developing a major mathematical concept through a series of investigations. The problems are designed to allow students to uncover the mathematics that is embedded in the situation. The sixth grade year begins with Prime Time, where students explore number theory and concepts involving factors, multiples, primes, and composites. From there, the first of three units focusing on rational numbers, Bits and Pieces 1, provides opportunities for understanding fractions, decimals and percents. Subsequent units on rational numbers interspersed between other topics deal with operations and applications. Other topics include a geometry unit that promotes reasoning about shapes, as well as properties of these shapes and their angles, as well as a measurement unit that emphasizes area and perimeter relationships of both regular and irregular, curved, and straight-sided figures.  In seventh grade, the students study pre-algebra, beginning with Variables and Patterns, which is an introduction to algebra, using tables, graphs and symbols as representations. Similarity concepts are developed in Stretching and Shrinking before exploring rate, ratio, proportion, percent, and proportional reasoning in Comparing and Scaling. Through activities from Accentuate the Negative, students develop an understanding and use of integers before Moving Straight Ahead highlights linear relationships expressed in words, tables, graphs, and symbols. The study of volume and 3-D measurement in Filling and Wrapping extends our study of geometry before concluding the year with What do You Expect, a unit on probability.  Eighth grade algebra begins by briefly reviewing arithmetic operations with integers, order of operations, and some aspects of geometry, especially area. Quickly though, students move into writing and solving equations, solving and graphing systems of equations, examining geometric and algebraic ratios through a variety of activities, and finally factoring quadratics. The end of the year will bring problems that begin to tie algebraic concepts together by formalizing our work with relations, functions, non-linear graphs, and solving inequalities. Lastly, the students will revisit quadratic equations more formally and work out a derivation of the quadratic formula.  Although those represent some of the mathematical topics for each year, the changes we hope to see in your children go beyond acquiring the fundamentals of algebra. We hope that they develop a greater sense of involvement and excitement about mathematical thinking, a greater sense of confidence and trust in their own abilities, a greater ability to clearly explain their thoughts and procedures both in writing and in conversation, and a greater awareness of the diverse skills and approaches that are embraced in mathematics and that can be discovered in each student.
__label__0 Mathematics  We offer two services in the area of mathematics to the students who attend the Career Center.  First, each student has a period per week of math that starts of the beginning of their Sophomore year and ends at the conclusion of the first semester of their junior year.

__label__0 TEXTBOOK*  Functions, Data, and Models: An Applied Approach to College Algebra  Sheldon P. Gordon and Florence S. Gordon  Functions, Data, and Models is a college-level algebra textbook that is written to provide the kind of mathematical knowledge and experience that students will need for courses in other fields such as biology, chemistry, business, finance, economics, and other areas that are heavily dependent on data either from laboratory experiments or from other studies. The book focuses on fundamental mathematical concepts and realistic problem-solving via mathematical modeling rather than the development of algebraic skills.  Functions, Data and Models presents college algebra in a way that differs from almost all college algebra books available today. The authors teach something new rather than covering the same ground as high school courses. By changing the content of the course, the authors are able to give students an introduction to data analysis and mathematical modeling that even students with limited algebraic skills can handle. The book contains rich exercises, many of which use real data. Also included are thought experiments or what if questions that are meant to stretch the student's mathematical thinking.

Syllabus / Outline  The interesting thing about this class is that we learn lots of math and numbers. Its interesting to learn this online because I never thought that I would learn math online. First I like that my teacher is there to help via email with my work. Next I like that the work is brought out to me in my class. Lastly I like that my math isn't super super hard. my least favorite thing is that since i'm no good at math I end up falling behind and I feel that I'm a bad math student. I would like to tell others that this class is very fun if you can understand math.

__label__0 Mathematics is the art and science of abstraction; it is the systematic study of quantity, structure, space, and change; to paraphrase Newton, it is the language in which the universe is written. The study of mathematics provides the abilities to analyze data, discover patterns, and reason logically.  Computer Science is the fusion of abstraction and technology; it is the study of representing, processing, and communicating information, the design and analysis of algorithms, and the implementation of solutions through both hardware and software. The study of computer science is both theoretical and practical, and provides the abilities to develop and to maintain software. Contact For additional information, please contact:
__label__0 [via]  One of the most commonly asked questions in a mathematics classroom is, "Will I ever use this stuff in real life?" Some teachers can give a good, convincing answer; others hem and haw and stare at the floor. The real response to the question should be, "Yes, you will, because algebra gives you power" the power to help your children with their math homework, the power to manage your finances, the power to be successful in your career (especially if you have to manage the company budget). The list goes on.  Algebra is a system of mathematical symbols and rules that are universally understood, no matter what the spoken language. Algebra provides a clear, methodical process that can be followed from beginning to end to solve complex problems. There's no doubt that algebra can be easy to some while extremely challenging to others. For those of you who are challenged by working with numbers, Algebra I For Dummies can provide the help you need.  This easy-to-understand reference not only explains algebra in terms you can understand, but it also gives you the necessary tools to solve complex problems. But rest assured, this book is not about memorizing a bunch of meaningless steps; you find out the whys behind algebra to increase your understanding of how algebra works.  In Algebra I For Dummies, you'll discover the following topics and more:  All about numbers rational and irrational, variables, and positive and negative  Figuring out fractions and decimals  Explaining exponents and radicals  Solving linear and quadratic equations  Understanding formulas and solving story problems  Having fun with graphs  Top Ten lists on common algebraic errors, factoring tips, and divisibility rules.  No matter if you're 16 years old or 60 years old; no matter if you're learning algebra for the first time or need a quick refresher course; no matter if you're cramming for an algebra test, helping your kid with his or her homework, or coming up with next year's company budget, Algebra I For Dummies can give you the tools you need to succeed [via]  Volume I of a pair of classic texts and standard references for a generation this book is the work of an expert algebraist who taught at Yale for two decades. Volume I covers all undergraduate topics, including groups, rings, modules, Galois theory, polynomials, linear algebra, and associative algebra. 1985 edition.  An array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. It then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterised by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including new chapters on topics of active interest: symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories, and the coherence theorems for them, as well as 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. [via]  . The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics.  Hermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. In The Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, "My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful."  Weyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to which The Classical Groups has proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton, Algebraic Theory of Numbers inaugurated the Annals of Mathematics Studies book series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics.  This text provides a supportive environment to help students successfully learn the content of a standard algebra course. By incorporating interactive learning techniques, the Aufmann team helps students to better understand concepts, focus their studying habits, and obtain greater mathematical success. [via]  This is a comprehensive review of commutative algebra, from localization and primary decomposition through dimension theory, homological methods, free resolutions and duality, emphasizing the origins of the ideas and their connections with other parts of mathematics. The book gives a concise treatment of Grobner basis theory and the constructive methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that flow from it. Many exercises included. [via]  More editions of Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry:  This textbook for advanced courses in group theory focuses on finite groups, with emphasis on the idea of group actions. Early chapters identify important themes and establish the notation used throughout the book, and subsequent chapters explore the normal and arithmetical structures of groups as well as applications. Includes 679 exercises. 1978 edition.  Presents the fundamentals of linear algebra in the clearest possible way, examining basic ideas by means of computational examples and geometrical interpretation. This substantial revision includes greater focus on relationships between concepts, smoother transition to abstraction, early exposure to linear transformations and eigenvalues, more emphasize on visualization, new material on least squares and QR-decomposition and a greater number of proofs. Exercise sets begin with routine drill problems, progress to problems with more substance and conclude with theoretical problems. [via]  Noted for its expository style and clarity of presentation this substantial revision reflects a new generation of students' changing needs. Proceeds from familiar concepts to the unfamiliar, from the concrete to the abstract. Features a wide variety of interesting contemporary applications which have been extensively revised and updated. Includes new material on least squares and QR-decomposition and greater emphasis on visualization. [via]  From the reviews: "The theory is systematically developed by the axiomatic method that has, since von Neumann, dominated the general approach to linear functional analysis and that achieves here a high degree of lucidity and clarity....The book contains about 350 well placed and instructive problems, which cover a considerable part of the subject. All in all this is an excellent work, of equally high value for both student and teacher." --ZENTRALBLATT FÜR MATHEMATIK [via]  Considered a classic by many, A First Course in Abstract Algebra is an in-depth, introduction to abstract algebra. Focused on groups, rings and fields, this text gives students a firm foundation for more specialized work by emphasizing an understanding of the nature of algebraic structures. The sixth edition of this text continues the tradition of teaching in a classical manner while integrating field theory and a revised Chapter Zero. New exercises were written, and previous exercises were revised and modified. [via]  Galois theory is a fascinating mixture of classical and modern mathematics, and in fact provided much of the seed from which abstract algebra has grown. It is a showpiece of mathematical unification and of "technology transfer" to a range of modern applications.  Galois Theory, Second Edition is a revision of a well-established and popular text. The author's treatment is rigorous, but motivated by discussion and examples. He further lightens the study with entertaining historical notes - including a detailed description of Évariste Galois' turbulent life. The application of the Galois group to the quintic equation stands as a central theme of the book. Other topics include the problems of trisecting the angle, duplicating the cube, squaring the circle, solving cubic and quartic equations, and the construction of regular polygons  For this edition, the author added an introductory overview, a chapter on the calculation of Galois groups, further clarification of proofs, extra motivating examples, and modified exercises. Photographs from Galois' manuscripts and other illustrations enhance the engaging historical context offered in the first edition.  Written in a lively, highly readable style while sacrificing nothing to mathematical rigor, Galois Theory remains accessible to intermediate undergraduate students and an outstanding introduction to some of the intriguing concepts of abstract algebra. [via]  The Study Guide is based on David Lay's many years in the classroom, and has been updated so students can take full advantage of the new projects and data in the Updated Second Edition of the text. This guide gives the worked-out solutions to model problems that correspond with exercises in the text, along with study tips, hints to students, instructions for using MATLAB along with the text, additional MATLAB exercises, and expanded coverage of some text material. Maple and Mathematica appendices have been added, and the TI appendix has been updated to include coverage of the TI-86. [via]  Linear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a "brick wall.". Finally, when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible. Students' conceptual understanding is reinforced through True/False questions, practice problems, and the use of technology. David Lay changed the face of linear algebra with the execution of this philosophy, and continues his quest to improve the way linear algebra is taught with the new Updated Second Edition. With this update, he builds on this philosophy through increased visualization in the text, vastly enhanced technology support, and an extensive instructor support package. He has added additional figures to the text to help students visualize abstract concepts at key points in the course. A new dedicated CD and Website further enhance the course materials by providing additional support to help students gain command of difficult concepts. The CD, included in the back of the book, contains a wealth of new materials, with a registration coupon allowing access to a password-protected Website. These new materials are tied directly to the text, providing a comprehensive package for teaching and learning linear algebra. [via]  This text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text. [via]  A student-oriented approach to linear algebra, now in its Second Edition  This introductory-level linear algebra text is for students who require a clear understanding of key algebraic concepts and their applications in such fields as science, engineering, and computer science. The text utilizes a parallel structure that introduces abstract concepts such as linear transformations, eigenvalues, vector spaces, and orthogonality in tandem with computational skills, thereby demonstrating clear and immediate relations between theory and application.  Introducing finite-dimensional representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras, this example-oriented book works from representation theory of finite groups, through Lie groups and Lie algrbras to the finite dimensional representations of the classical groups.

__label__0 Secondary Mathematics Education Lab  The Secondary Mathematics Laboratory is housed on the second floor in Stright 211. This curriculum library is designed to help present and future teachers with designing lessons that teach mathematics effectively to students in grades 7–12.  The lab has textbooks from the 1960s to the present. It also has many manipulatives that students, teachers, and faculty members can use for enhancing their lessons. There is also a portable SMART Board that students and faculty can use for practice or preparation.  Most of the books and materials can be checked out. However, the most recent texts are used daily by students, so those texts are required to stay in the lab. If you would like any additional information about the lab or would like to use its resources, contact Dr. Brian Sharp.
__label__0 PURPOSE: Students will develop an understanding of and the applications for linear equations and their graphical displays.  DESCRIPTION: The unit on graphing linear equations will begin with students learning to manipulate an equation into slope-intercept form. This will be accomplished through classroom discussion and guided practice from an overhead projector and the chalkboard. Students will then have independent practice with a lesson from their algebra text. Another series of lessons will follow on graphing equations and the various methods of graphing a linear equation.  The proposed lesson will follow after becoming familiar with slope intercept form, manipulating an equation, and graphing equations. Students will participate in a cooperative learning activity of matching a graphic display with an equation. A Kagan Activity; corner; will then be used for students to practice graphing an equation. After the review students will reinforce the concepts learned through the use of a graphing calculator. Future concepts such as parallel and perpendicular lines will also be introduced. Through the use of a LitePro and one computer, students will be introduced in the classroom to the computer program, Green Globs and Graphing Equations. Students will then move to the computer lab and work individually on the tutorial and game. Upon completion of the game, students will then complete an Internet lesson on the applications of the concepts learned. Students will communicate their understanding of the concepts learned through a journal entry as well as other methods.  This is a building block in algebra; therefore, this concept will carry on for many more lessons and possibly years.  ACTIVITIES:  (Note: This is a unit plan that may cover several days to several weeks. Not all of the following activities/standards will appear in the video clips used.)  After a brief into and a review of linear equations students will be given an equation and a graphical display of a different linear equation. Students must find the graphical display which matches their equation. Upon finding their match, students will work in groups of three or four to verify each otherís match. A code is on the back of each and the correct match will be revealed by the teacher.  Mathematics: 2, 3, 6, 8  Working in groups of three or four, students will each take an equation and create the graphic display for their equation. Then students will regroup so that one from each original group will now be working with others with the same equation; students will do a peer assessment. Students return to their original group and take turns showing their group members how they arrived at their graphic display. All students are to complete each graphic as it is explained. This is a Spencer Kagan activity entitled, corners. Each studentsí graphics are turned in to the teacher.  Mathematics: 2, 3, 6, 8  Using graphing calculators students will extend their investigations of linear equations. Students will draw conclusions about slope and y-intercept. The concept of parallel and perpendicular lines will be introduced.  Mathematics: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9  Grades 6-8: 4, 7, 9  Grades 9-12: 8, 10  The computer program Green Globs & Graphing Equations (Sunburst) will be used to reinforce the concept of slope-intercept form. The software will be introduced in the classroom with the use of an LCD Projector. In a lab setting students will be given 20 levels of lines to identify the equation. For each line given, students are to give the equation in slope-intercept form. If a student does not get the equation correct, a red line is graphed for his/her equation so that the student can see if they have the slope correct or maybe the intercept is what is wrong. Students are given unlimited chances on writing the equation for the line; however, they must get an equation correct for each level the first time in order to advance to the next level. I have created a record-keeping sheet in which students keep up with how many times they incorrectly write an equation. After completing the lesson, students will then play the game Green Globs in which they are to write an equation for lines that will hit as many globs as possible with one line in order to get points. Students become very interested in slope and intercepts at this point, and they also become very competitive. The program has a record keeping system for the top ten scores.  Mathematics: 1, 2, 3, 6  Grades 6-8: 4, 5, 8  Using the Internet as a resource, students will gather data to create a graphic display and experience a real world application of the use of linear equations. Students will be supplied with other possible sites they may visit which will reinforce the algebraic concepts covered in this lesson.  Mathematics: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10  Grades 6-8: 4, 8, 10  Grades 9-12: 7, 9  As a summation students will write an entry in their journal that demonstrates their understanding of the the concepts learned.  ASSESSMENT: The matching of a linear equation with the graphic display. Peer-assessment will occur during the Kagan Activity, corners. Self-assessment will be done from the visual display of the overhead calculator. A rubric will be used for Green Globs & Graphing Equations tutorial. The Internet lesson and journal entry will be assessed by the teacher. Students will also be assessed through out the course on this concept.  TIMELINE & COURSE OUTLINE: This unit will come early in the course and this activity will be used after students are successful at manipulating equations. My students were reenacting this activity to an extent. I did not do the Internet lesson the same way earlier. This lesson can be taught in a 90-minute block and students may use open lab time to further research the sites given.  COMMENTS: I have used the computer program Green Globs for several years with great success. Students donít complain about graphing equations; they actually enjoy it. The game feature allows students to demonstrate their understanding of the concept in a competitive way.  Technology Resources: I chose the computer program, Green Globs, after first seeing it demonstrated at a technology conference. The program is individual and has a broad range of tutorials. The cost of the computer program is reasonable and very well worth the money. Students are more enthused about learning mathematics and actually enjoy it.  The use of the overhead graphing calculator and student graphing calculators gives students the opportunity to instantly see results therefore draw conclusions and introduce future concepts.  I like using the LitePro projector to take the students on a virtual field trip in the classroom prior to turning them loose on their own with the computer. This takes care of a lot of questions later.  Teaching Strategy: Allowing students to work in groups makes it less threatening and also gives each student a support group. So many times students donít like math because they are afraid they will fail and are therefore threatened by the subject. Giving students a support group to fall back on is like having a safety net and thus makes them more willing to try solutionsI feel that the use of a computer program to enhance learning is a strong part of this lesson. Democracy is a crucial part of this lesson as well because students must be able to share power, make decisions, and demonstrate Individual Responsibility of the responsibility. Having students actively involved in their learning and assessing each other puts part of the responsibility on them and makes them have ownership of their learning. The use of the graphing calculator is a reinforcement of the concepts learned as well as a Reflection and introduction of future concepts.  Student Characteristics: All students learn at different rates and through different modes so for that reason I have tried to make this lesson as well-rounded as possible in that we still do concrete and abstract activities as well as thinking. The students in this class were not all what I would call typical math students and with the use of the technology in this lesson those students were given an opportunity to fail and retry until success was found.  How the Activity Has Evolved Over Time: I have used the computer program for several years and added the pre-activities to the lesson to facilitate learning for the slower students and reintroduce the concepts to all students. The Internet lesson was added so that students would see a real-world application of the mathematical concepts. The journal entry is also a way of having students demonstrate understanding through writing.

__label__0 Calculus ABCs:  Absolutely Basic Competency  Introduction  Freshman Calculus covers a wide range of topics. As students struggle to learn concepts, techniques, and applications, it is possible for certain basic skills to get lost in the shuffle. To ensure that students who pass freshman calculus can do the basics, the Department of Mathematics has identified standards for "Absolutely Basic Competency"--what we call the Calculus ABCs. There are separate standards for MA131 and MA132, covering only prerequisite material (see below). In both of these courses, students must demonstrate mastery of these basic skills in order to receive a grade of C or better.  Requirement  Passing a Calculus ABCs Test is a minimum requirement for getting a grade of C or better in the course: passing means you may earn any grade (A to F) in the course (based on other coursework), while not passing means you may earn no higher than a D+ (regardless of other coursework). This requirement is part of MA131 and MA132 each semester they are taught, and also applies to placement tests for those courses administered at Clarkson. A passing score is 90% or better; all problems are graded right/wrong (essentially no partial credit). ABCs tests will be offered as needed during the first half of the semester. Each student may take up to five tests in order to pass; if needed, they may take one last ABCs test during final exam week (in addition to the regular course final exam).  Advice  Take the test seriously--for many students this is a real challenge. Practice using the sample tests (see below) and learn the material solidly before taking the test. Do not just show up and hope to pass by luck (you won't)--the only way to succeed here is to master the material. You should also read the Instructions for Grading before taking the test, so you will know for sure what is expected.
__label__0 About 2.0  CK-12 Foundation introduces its version 2.0 which provides the component missing in version 1.0 – a focus around learning. At CK-12, we believe that learning is an individual activity requiring many things – multiple modalities, interactions with other human beings (such as teachers, peers, and parents) as well as collaborations. Hence, in this version of the system we combine student-centric learning with teacher-centric tools and materials to create a dynamic system that can be used by anyone. Our belief is that this will help in reducing "gaps" and provide the ability to fill these gaps.  Users will continue to find high quality, national and international standards aligned content in K-12 Science and Math subjects. As before, that content can be used to create customized books or courses. New to the system are concepts, smaller chunks of content that can be used to learn or review specific topics. The concepts are supported with many associated modalities as well as interactive and automated exercises and assessments allowing for students to see where they are and how they are progressing. Interactive learning objects as well as simulations from entities such as Wolfram will support these concepts. In addition, we will be providing a guiding system allowing students to learn at their own pace with purpose. This navigational system at the same time, will allow for teachers to mentor their students.  Version 2 of CK-12′s system is the next step toward the foundation's mission to increase the access of high quality educational materials for all. Important features include:  High quality, standards-aligned content for science and math presented at the book and now concept levels. (Concepts can be combined to form chapters and books.) The previous format of book and chapter will still be available.  A "Concept Map" to show the interrelation of concepts, providing a guided path of learning for those who are interested.  As always, the ability to edit and customize, both at the concept and book level.

__label__0 Technology in Education  Monday, April 5, 2010  Cabri 3D is one of dynamic geometry software. This software helps students with the visualization of 3D figures their properties. The purpose of this software is to help students to better understand three-dimensional space, since three-dimensional space is difficult to visualize. Cabri 3D allows students and teachers to construct and manipulate solid geometry objects in three dimensions. It provides a tool for teachers and students to explore properties of 3D geometric constructions  Even though it is Cabri 3D, two dimensions objects can still be created. The software is suitable with many two dimensions concepts such as length, sectors of circles, lateral area, surface area. Cabri 3D will help students to learn analyzing characteristics and properties of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes and develop arguments of mathematics about geometrical relationships. Students also can learn to use visualization, spatial reasoning, and geometric modeling to solve problems  Cabri 3D is appropriate for secondary school students. Even though the software is not very user friendly, the students can be successful with the program if they learn through the manual. Teachers who want to use it in their classes have to be advanced in using it. Even though the software is not user friendly, it still offers a lot of great features that help student to get success in learning mathematics especially in geometry class.  Monday, March 15, 2010  I reviewed a Mathematics WebQuest. Its title is Vector WebQuest. There are some weaknesses and strengths of this WebQuest. The weaknesses are it is not complex, does not have analytical question and does not has sufficient explanation on the process. On the other hand, the strengths of the WebQuest are an interested introduction and a range of web sites been accessed.  The most weakness of the WebQuest is it is not complex. It has only three parts. They are introduction, task and process. The WebQuest does not have evaluation, conclusion, and teacher page. Based on the criteria of a WebQuest, these elements are very important. Without Evaluation and conclusion, a WebQuest will be less useful. Another weakness is there is no any analytical question. Analytical questions are very important, since one of the purposes of a Webquest is to support learner thinking at the level of analysis. On this WebQuest, The level of questions is comprehension. Overall, the questions are not able to encourage students to think at high level thinking. The last weakness is it does not have sufficient explanation that is provided to students in order to accomplish the task. The WebQuest does not have full potential of web such as sound and video.  One of strength of the WebQuest is its introduction provides information that engages students to explore further. It is started with interesting issues. This issue will grab students' attention. Another strength is its link to supported documents such as vector form. Moreover, it also provides various web sites such as .com, .edu and .gov. Some of the links take students directly to pages they need to go.  Even though the web quest has an interested introduction and various web sites been accessed, it is still inappropriate to be used by students because it does not fulfill the basic criteria of a WebQuest.  Friday, February 19, 2010  I am curious to learn and assess computer technology for learning mathematics and science. Even though there are many issues surround the using of computer technology in learning mathematics and science, computer technology offers new ways to learn. It helps students to learn based on problem solving. Another advantage is by using computer technology teachers can create inquiry-based mathematics and science classroom. Of course, besides those things, There are many other advantages of using computer technology in learning mathematics and science.  One of software that I am interested to learn is TinkerPlots. TinkerPlots is software for students in grades 4 through 8. The use of software is to build fluency with data representation and exploration. Animation, color, and dynamic manipulation support students in moving from simple representations to increasingly complex and analytic graphs. Another aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data.

Tuesday, February 9, 2010  Speech Recognition. Windows 7 has a feature that allows people to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. It is Speech Recognition. We can find this feature on Ease of Access. Before we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer. There are some issues that we have to think about before using Speech Recognition: (1) Speech Recognition needs a good microphone. (2) Training the computer to identify the speaker sounds and pronunciation. (3) Speak clearly and pronounce words carefully, not too fast and or too slow. To open Speech Recognition: (1)Start the Speech Recognition by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking Ease of Access, and then clicking Windows Speech Recognitions. (2)Click microphone button to start the listening mode  By using Speech Recognition we can do the following things: (1) We can use our voice to control our computer. (2) We can say commands that the computer will respond (3) We can dictate text to the computer.  Speech Recognition makes a classroom or lesson more Universally Designed. Speech recognition allows students to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. This feature is useful to students with a wide range of disabilities including those with visual, mobility and language impairments. This feature will be very useful in a classroom which the numbers of students with disabilities integrated into it. Today, nearly every class and schoolwork are related to computer. For example statistics class, students will analyze graphical displays of data, including dot plots, stem plots, and histograms, to identify and describe patterns and departures from patterns. In this class they will use computer to create graphical displays. By using Speech recognition and Microsoft excel, students with mobility impairment are still able to participate well in the class. They can input data and command to create a graphic.  Speech Recognition helps students with mobility and visual impairment. Students with mobility impairments might be unable to use (or be without) arms or fingers to interact with their computers using a standard keyboard or mouse. Using their voice is a way to interact with their computer. By using speech recognition they can operate their computer and compose text. Another is visual impairment, blindness, for example. Students who are blind interact with their computers through keyboards, Braille devices, and audio/voice rather than a traditional monitor and mouse. If they don't have these special devices, they are still able to operate their computer by using Speech Recognition.  Conclusion A more accessible technology is good for everyone, including students with disabilities and students without disability. All students benefit from technology in which it is easier to function. Providing accessible technology in the classroom to students with disabilities enables all students to have the same opportunities in education. Speech Recognition gives an easy way to interact with computer not only for students with a disability but also those without a disability. It also helps us to make an inclusive classroom with equal access for all students.  Monday, January 25, 2010  Mathematics is my subject domain, during I taught mathematics I used some dynamic geometry software, such as Cabry, Geometer's Sketchpad, GeoGebra and Autograph. These are typically used in the classroom or the computer lab and they are very helpful in teaching the difficult concept.  It is little bit difficult to find an appropriate technology device in everyday life for teaching and learning the difficult concept of mathematics. Since mathematics concept is completely different from other concepts such as social science, English, etc.Based on my teaching experience in primary school, when I teach a difficult concept, I had to prove the concept and visualized it. these things can be done by using a software for teaching mathematics that requires a certain specification of a computer.  However, Nowadays, there is a technology in education known as mobile learning. Mobile Learning is a learning model adopted cellular technology development and mobile phones where this technology can be used as a learning medium. To use this technology, we can download the applications and install them on a mobile phone or use them online by using mobile phone.  Mobile learning technology can be used to teach mathematics. One of web sites that provides mobile learning applications for teaching and learning mathematics is  So far, Mobile Learning is very helpful as a supplement material for teaching mathematics. It is easy for students to bring mobile phones wherever they go, this technology will help them to learn mathematics wherever and whenever.

__label__0 Bringing a new vitality to college mathematics  Let's talk variables. Do we want students to develop an understanding of variable concepts (whether in a developmental math course or not)? Is accurate use of variable notation enough? If students can model applications and accurately determine solutions … is that enough? Is there a role for linguistic literacy in mathematics?  One of the issues we face in college is dealing (or not) with prior learning. Without intervention, prior learning (even when inaccurate) survives — often surviving in the face of conflicting information in the current learning environment. Visualize the prior learning as being as a stable mass of 'knowledge' (even though it has gaps and errors); as students go through a class as adults, information that connects positively with the old reinforces the old. When new information does not connect or conflicts with the old, the low-energy (natural) response is to build new storage … resulting in that solid core being supplemented by weak veneers of new knowledge. This, of course, is an incomplete visualization for the actual processes in the human brain. The suggestion is that students approach a math class with an attitude that supports old information and minimizes cognitive effort for dealing with new or incompatible information.  In my beginning algebra class this week, we did the test on exponents and polynomials. Although the test includes some artificially difficult problems with negative exponents, most of the items deal with important ideas. One of the most basic items on the test was this:  Evaluate a² + (3b)² for a = -3 and b = 2  Several students made this mistake with the first term:  -3² = -9  A smaller group of students made this mistake with the second term:  (32)²  Now, this is a good class — all students are actually doing homework and attending class almost every day. We had dealt with the first situation at the start of the semester. How could these errors survive to this point?  Both errors are based on variable as a symbol to be replaced by a number, which is not complete. They might represent a visual approach, not verbal. Variables represent quantities involved in sums and products, where products with variables are implied … and more than this. Simplifying expressions might — or might not — uncover the incomplete understanding. What can I do to help students with this?  I am planning on incorporating some linguistic activities around variables in the first week of the semester. Some of the ideas are from a old book called "English Skills for Algebra" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print. The authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students. Some of their activities involve listening to somebody read mathematical statements and the student writing them down. I think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).  I do know that just saying "that was wrong … this is right" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding. I need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables. Some energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together. Without that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.  Share this:  5 Comments  (1) The concept of "variable" is a means towards an end. It should thus not be surprising that to "teach an understanding of variable" does not work. It cannot.  In a developmental context, the obvious end is the discussion of function: we need a paper representation for what we input.  Thus, my attempt in could not work because, as I eventually realized and mentioned in , I should have had—and will have real soon now—a "Chapter 3 – Functions".  (2) The usual definition of powers does not work very well in the remedial situation. For something that works, see freemathtexts.org  Thus, 5(3b)^2 should be read as "5 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b", i.e. 5•3b•3b, and the default rule "when there is no coefficient, it goes without saying that it is 1″ lets us read (3b)^2 as "1 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b", i.e. 1•3b•3b.  (3) Re "linguistic activities", what is very likely to work is having the mathematics text used as the reading material in a remedial English reading course. Of course, the text cannot be the usual prescriptive stuff (that takes students for idiots) but one that has faith in the ability of the students to be receptive to arguments.  Granted, writing this kind of text is not easy.  In order to see what I mean, one might want to look up my own attempts which can be found at freemathtexts.org and freemathtexts.org

__label__0 WHAT DOES A MATHEMATICS MAJOR STUDY?  Mathematics is one of the fundamental areas of human knowledge. It has held an established position among the humanities for over two thousand years, and in recent centuries it has played a vital role in the sciences. The body of mathematical knowledge is growing today faster than ever before, with old questions being answered and new ones asked at an unprecedented rate.  In the paragraphs below, we sketch some of the courses and topics which mathematics majors study at Wright State University. In each case, the illustrations of what students learn are only small samples of the full curriculum.  Mathematics majors typically begin their college mathematics studies with three semesters of Calculus. Calculus is both the cornerstone of "analysis," one of the major branches of pure mathematics, and an indispensable tool for most of the sciences and engineering. Students learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right. Students study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.  All mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year. This basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, "algebra" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications. In linear algebra, the study of linear equations, like those in beginning high school algebra -- but with the possibility of thousands of equations in thousands of unknowns -- leads to abstract mathematical spaces.  The Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a variety of more advanced courses. Students decide which of these to take according to their interests and the particular degree which they seek. For example, students apply multivariable calculus in probability and the mathematical foundations of statistical inference in Theory of Statistics. Related choices include Statistical Methods and Introduction to Experimental Designs, in which one learns how to collect and analyze data, for instance in scientific and industrial experiments.  Similarly, students can choose mathematics courses with special significance in computer science. A prime example is Applied Graph Theory, featuring mathematical models and algorithms applicable to such problems as traffic systems, activity scheduling, and design layout. Others are Cryptography (how to encrypt data securely) and Coding Theory (how to send messages that self-correct transmission errors).  Other courses in applied mathematics emphasize mathematical theory and problem solving methods directed toward the physical sciences and engineering. An illustrative example at the junior level is Partial Differential Equations involving several variables (e.g., both space and time). They describe such phenomena as the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space, and the flow of heat in solids.  Courses in pure mathematics concentrate upon the theoretical foundations of algebra, calculus, and other elementary courses, and at the same time point the way toward more advanced topics in modern mathematics. To illustrate, students in Real Variables (or theoretical advanced calculus) learn why the facts and computational methods learned in ordinary calculus are correct; in Modern Algebra, students study various abstract systems which include the familiar objects of school mathematics as special cases (whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, etc.)  In addition to taking many courses in the major field of study, every undergraduate at Wright State University is required to take a comprehensive program of General Education studies, including courses in history, English, economics, the sciences, and several other disciplines. Moreover, some degree programs allow students to take "free electives," or courses chosen by students from essentially any area. Wright State's degree programs in mathematics have a generous allotment of these free electives.

__label__0 Matrices are very powerful mathematical tools applicable in a wide range of real world problems. Intuitively, the main advantage in using matrices is that they allow the logical manipulation of very large sets of numbers at once. More rigorously, they allow the manipulation (and solution) of linear equation systems which in turn reppresent real world problems.  Just as example, the voltages and currents in an electronic board with 1000 components can be described by a very huge system of linear equations. 1000 components imply 1000 unknown voltages and 1000 unknown currents. Attempting to find such a large number of unknown variables without a method is substantially a suicide. With the use of matrices such a system can be solved in a very elegant way.  Today, matrices are used not simply for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, but also for describing the quantum mechanics of atomic structure, designing computer game graphics, analyzing relationships, and even plotting complicated dance steps :)  In this article we try to develop our mathematical tool step by step.  Definition  A matrix is an ordered, bidimensional collection of mathematical expressions usually rapresented as a rectangular table.  The horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical lines are called columns. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m-by-n matrix (written mxn) and m and n are called its dimensions. The dimensions of a matrix are always given with the number of rows first, then the number of columns.  If the number of rows of a matrix equals the number of columns (m = n) then the matrix is said to be square otherwise it's just rectangular. Square matrixes have several interesting properties that we'll talk about later.  The entry of a matrix A that lies in the i-th row and the j-th column is called the i,j entry or (i,j)-th entry of A. This is written as ai,j, aij or A[i,j]. The row is always noted first, then the column.  A special matrix with one of the dimensions set to 1 is called vector. A 1xn matrix is called row vector  while a mx1 matrix is called column vector.  If the entries of a matrix are all real numbers then the matrix is said to be real. If the entries are complex numbers then the matrix is too said to be complex. If the entries are polynomials then (guess what?) the matrix is said to be polynomial too.  The entries of a matrix usually have some associated meaning but for now let's just say they are mathematical expressions (maybe numbers) and concentrate on matrix manipulation.  Let's play with it  We define the matrix sum as an operation that given two mxn matrices A,B returns a mxn matrix C with entries that are sums of the corresponding entries in A and B. Please note that the sum is defined only for matrices of exactly the same dimensions: we say that such matrices are sum-compatible.  For sum-compatible matrices it's obvious that  and  We define the scalar multiplication as an operation that given a mxn matrix A and a scalar expression K returns a mxn matrix B with each entry made of the corresponding entry of A multiplied by K.  It's again obvious that for sum-compatible matrices A,B and any scalar expression k  and for any matrix A and any couple of scalar expressions k1, k2  Food for thoughs: Multiplication by scalar is commutative if the underlying ring (of expressions) is commutative. This is true when the expressions are (real or complex) numbers or polynomials, that is most real-world cases in that matrices are applicable. However, the matrix algebra can be applied also to non commutative rings (for example quaternions) where the multiplication by scalar must be splitted in two different operations: left multiplication and right multiplication.  Not that obvious  We define the matrix multiplication as an operation that given a mxp matrix A and a pxn matrix B returns a mxn matrix C with element i,j computed as the scalar vector product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.  Note that the matrix multiplication is well defined only for couples in that the left matrix has the number of columns equal to the number of rows of the right matrix. We say such two matrices to be multiplication-compatible.  Food for thoughs: the multiplication of two nxn matrices processes 2 n2 entries. However there is no known algorithm with computational cost of O(n2). Most algorithm are O(n3) and the most clever implementations are O(n2.8). An O(n2.376) algorithm has been proposed by Coppersmith and Winograd but its implicit factor hidden by the O() notation is so big that its implementation is worthwile only if we're going to multiply matrices with n that is out of our current computing possibilities.  It's very easy to show that (and here comes the non obvious) the matrix multiplication is generally not commutative, that is  except for very few special cases. The (square) matrices for that  are said to commute and must satisfy strict rules on their elements.  The non commutativity of the matrix multiplication makes the algebraic manipulation to become non trivial and causes infinite headcaches to engineering students.  However, we're lucky since the associative and distributive properties still apply and it can be proven that the following equations are all true (given that the matrices involved are multiplication-compatible and the underlying ring is commutative).  Transpose  We define the transpose of a mxn matrix A as a nxm matrix B obtained from A by swapping rows with columns. The transpose of a matrix A is often written as AT or as A'.  Note that swapping rows with means effectively swapping the order of indices of each element. The element aij of the matrix A becomes the element aji of the transpose.  Food for thoughs: This property is interesting in computer matrix processing. To apply an algorithm to the transpose of a matrix instead of the original one we can simply swap the parameters of all the matrix element access functions...  A matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a symmetric matrix; that is, A is symmetric if AT = A. Note that A must be square to be symmetric and internally the elements must satisfy the relation aij = aji.  It's easy to show that  for any matrix A, thus the transposition is a self-inverse operation.  Also for two matrices with the same dimensions  If the matrices A and B are multiplication-compatible then  Note that the order of multiplication is inverted.  And finally taking the transpose of a scalar (1x1 matrix) is a null operation  The identity  A particular square matrix that commutes with all other matrices of the same size is the identity matrix. The identity matrix has all unit elements on its main diagonal.  It's easy to prove that  and thus the identity matrix is the "unity" element of the matrix algebra and the multiplication by the identity matrix is an idempotent operation.  Obviously the transpose of an identity matrix is still an identity matrix.  The inverse  Given a square matrix A we define the inverse matrix of A as the matrix that when multiplied by A gives the identity matrix as result. The inverse matrix is usually written as A-1.  The inverse matrix does not necessairly exist. A matrix that has no inverse is said to be non invertible or singular.  Note that A and its inverse (when it exists) do commute.  Food for thoughs: for non square matrices we can define the left (A-1A=I) and the right inverse (AA-1)=I. Such inverses have few real world applications...  It can be shown that the inverse of a matrix is again invertible and that  for any invertible matrix A and that  for any invertible matrix A and any non null scalar k.  It can be also proven that  for invertible matrices A and B of the same size. Note that the order of factors is inverted and the formula is very similar to the one that involves transposition.  Finding the inverse of a matrix is a very common highly intensive computational task. There are several algorithms that implement this operation and many of them operate better on matrices with elements that satisfy certain properties or conformations.  The above system of m linear equations in n unknown variables can be rewritten by using matrices as follows  The rows of the A matrix on the left contain the coefficients of the linear equations of the system. The unknown variables and the known terms are collected in row vectors x and b.  Solving the system means finding the set of values x1,x2,...,xn that satisfy all the equations at the same time. In most cases (if the field of the matrix elements is infinite) exactly one of the following statements is true:  the system is undetermined (the set of solutions is empty)  the system is overdetermined (the set of solutions contains infinitely many elements)  the system is exactly determined (the set of solutions contains contain exactly one element)  The most interesting case is obviously the one with exactly one solution. The Rouche'-Capelli theorem states that for a system of linear equations with n unknown variables to be exactly determined there must be at least n linearly independent equations. Since more equations are unnecessary then the most interesting linear systems are described by a square coefficient matrix.  By using trivial manipulations we can now show that by inverting the matrix of coefficients we can solve the system. We multiply boths sides of the system equation by the inverse of A  Since by definition  so the formula above can be rewritten as  and since  then trivially  The last formula is very important since it provides the real motivation for studying the inverse matrices. If we're able to find the inverse of A, we can solve the system.  Determinants  The definition of the matrix determinant is quite scary. Given a square nxn matrix A, it's determinant is defined as  where E(n) is the set of permutations of the numbers {1,2,....n}, P is a single permutation taken out of that set and sgn(P) is a function that returns +1 if the permutation P is even and -1 if the permutation P is odd. P(i), then, is the i-th element of the permutation P.  The formula above is also known as Liebniz formula. and is better explained with an example. Consider the following 2x2 matrix.  In this case n is 2 and thus E(n) is the set of the possible permutations of numbers {1,2}. E(n) obviously contains only two elements: the trivial "null" permutation {1,2} (which is even) and the permutation {2,1} (which is odd).  The Liebniz formula expands then to a sum of two elements dictated by the two permutations just described. Each element of the sum is a product of n elements of the matrix taken from distinct columns. The row of each element is choosen by the permutation.  In the first product we move along the columns (indexed by i) from left to right and take the first and the second row (null permutation). This means a11 and a22. Since the permutation used is even, then the sign of this product is positive.  In the second product we move along the columns from left to right and take the second and then the first row (the odd permutation). This means a21 and a12. Since the permutation is odd, then the sign of this product is negative.  The determinant of the 2x2 matrix is then  This is rather easy to remember if you note that it's the sum of the products of the two diagonals of the 2x2 matrix. The product is positive if the diagonal goes "up" from left to right while it's negative if the diagonal goes "down" from left to right.  The formula for 3x3 matrices is more complex and it contains 6 elements.  If you look close you can still spot the same pattern. There are positive diagonal lines that go down from left to right and negative diagonal lines that go up from left to right.  The formula for 4x4 matrices becomes really complex and is rarely written explicitly. For larger n values the formula becomes very difficult to use because it's hard to enumerate all the permutations of n numbers. Other methods for finding the determinant exist and later we'll probably spot some of them but now let's look at some of the determinant properties.  It can be shown that for square matrices A and B, any scalar r and the square unit matrix I the following properties are true  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  Invertible matrices and their determinants  Since for an invertible matrix A  then by property 4 of the previous paragraph  and since  then  which implies that  and that  Conversely, it can be shown that a non-zero determinant for matrix A implies that the inverse of A exists. The proof requires the notion of the rank of a matrix which we haven't covered so I'm going to omit it here. However, the two deductions lead us to the following theorem:  "A matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero"  or alternatively  "A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non zero"  Food for thoughs: As a rule of thumb, almost all square matrices are invertible. Over the field of real numbers, this can be made precise as follows: the set of singular n-by-n matrices, is a null set, i.e., has Lebesgue measure zero. Intuitively, this means that if you pick a random square matrix over the reals, the probability that it will be singular is zero. In practice however, one may encounter non-invertible matrices. And in numerical calculations, matrices which are invertible, but close to a non-invertible matrix, can still be problematic; such matrices are said to be ill conditioned.

An understanding of mathematics helps people to develop and use logical approaches to procedures and arguments. A grasp of geometrical ideas helps people to appreciate symmetry and patterns and helps them to make sensible designs.  Mathematics involves skills of calculation and estimation and the ability to reason logically. It develops the creativity and problem solving involved in technological and scientific innovation and discovery.  Skills learned and practiced in the mathematics curriculum can be applied across a wide range of occupations such as banking, accountancy, statistics, management, architecture, science, teaching, engineering, insurance, financial planning, economics, weather forecasting, trades and so on.

__label__0 It is true that they are more rigorous that the Edexcel textbooks, which are not very taxing for the person who is aiming for A/A* in Further Maths A Level. I'm not sure how necessary they are though. Why not loan a copy from a library before deciding on the purchase, or just purchasing the first one before committing, at least?  I used the further pure book when doing my A-level further maths on AQA. It was good for additional exercises and additional persepctive from my main course book (the Gaulter and Gaulter one) but it was pretty old, at least the edition I was using was. Someone will correct me if I'm mistaken, but I think my teacher mentioned it was the book she used in the 1980s for her A-levels so you may find it's a bit old fashioned in the approach.  It's true that these books are very old but we still use them with our students doing Maths and especially Further Maths on the CIE syllabus.  The problem is not so much old fashioned-ness in style, but that they don't match to your syllabus. The red book probably covers the A-level more or less completely, but the stuff you need is mixed up with stuff you don't, so it's a bit inconvenient. The yellow book may or may not cover all of your Further syllabus, and it will definitely have stuff you don't need (unless you're doing STEP, and even then you might not need groups), and it might be missing very important parts (e.g. in CIE we do vector spaces, and it's lacking in that area).  They have a lot of detail and a lot of good, challenging questions - they'll be a good supplementary text for higher achieving students.  (Original post by isp-) Maths:  [ Further Maths:

__label__0 fartherThis book is about how to solve difficult real problems by an easy method that uses the dimensions of the problem to derive an answer. Dimensions are things like inches, feet, seconds, and so on that are used to set up the answer to a problem usually described in words. How many meters in a mile? How many seconds in a year? How fast is a car going if it accelerates for ten miles per hour every second for 20 seconds? How far has it traveled? How high is an airplane if a wrench dropped from it takes 30 seconds to hit the ground? How many moles of water in 12 pounds? How much money can be saved by insulating a house?  These and practically all problems that have a dimension can be solved by the methods shown in this book.  The author strongly believes that this method should be taught in all high schools. He believes that 9th grade would be the best starting time and at the beginning of the year. He has called this method Dimensional Analysis. Students would only require two weeks to become proficient.  Mr. Kelly taught three 8th grade classes how to use Dimensional Analysis in only three days. The response by the science teacher and students was strongly positive.  It became clear however that reinforcement of the technique was needed. This book �IT�S DIMENSIONAL� is a result of that perceived need.
__label__0 Description  Harold Davenport was one of the truly great mathematicians of the twentieth century. Based on lectures he gave at the University of Michigan in the early 1960s, this book is concerned with the use of analytic methods in the study of integer solutions to Diophantine equations and Diophantine inequalities. It provides an excellent introduction to a timeless area of number theory that is still as widely researched today as it was when the book originally appeared. The three main themes of the book are Waring's problem and the representation of integers by diagonal forms, the solubility in integers of systems of forms in many variables, and the solubility in integers of diagonal inequalities.

__label__0 Manga Guide to Linear Algebra – Review  [14 Aug 2012]  I recently received a review copy of The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra.  The "Manga Guides" have been very popular and currently the series includes such topics as Biochemistry, Calculus, Databases, Electricity, Electricity, Molecular Biology, Physics, Regression Analysis, Relativity, Statistics, and The Universe. The front of the book includes rave reviews for these earlier books in the series.  Earlier I reviewed the "Statistics" and "Databases" volumes. I said at the time the Manga Guides appeared to be a "winning formula", since the manga story motivated the reader to read on to the next chapter, and the books show empathy for the struggles students experience while learning such topics.  I'm not as enthusiastic about the Linear Algebra volume, since I think it missed several opportunities to help the novice learner.  Guide to Linear Algebra – the promise  The story involves Reiji, a skinny kid and Misa, the cute sister of a karate master.  Many students struggle with linear algebra, so I was looking forward to diving in, especially to see the discussion on practical applications.  The good  Let's face it. Most math books are not page-turners for most people. Anything a writer can do to maintain motivation is a good thing.  Keeping with the tradition of the others in the series, The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has a cute story line. Nerdy Reiji takes on the job of tutoring the Hanamichi Hammer's little sister in the topic of Linear Algebra. In return, he can join the Hammer's karate club. In his first meeting with the big brother, Reiji is warned not to fraternize with Misa.  The manga story continues throughout the book between each slab of math. It works – you want to find out what happens next in the story and with math sandwiched between the manga, it's quite a good concept.  Included are a few nice explanations of Japanese culture, like "ossu" (a saying used by martial artists to increase concentration).  On the math side, Gaussian Elimination in Japanese is "Hakidashihou", or "Sweeping out". This is a good way to remember the concept (both for Japanese native speakers and those reading a translation).  The not-so-good  I feel that a book like this provides a great opportunity to discuss the "big picture" concepts, so readers become more aware of the "why" and "how it is used" of Linear Algebra. Leave the nitty-gritty of the micro-level math to the conventional textbooks and ensure the reader has the answers to the key what, why and how questions.  Certainly the book attempts to achieve that outcome, however, I was disappointed that some of the opportunities were lost, and some of the messages promulgated by the book are unfortunate.  Early on, (p15), Misa asks some reasonable questions that most students will ask.  Misa: But I still don't understand… What is linear algebra exactly?  Reiji: That's a tough question to answer properly.  Misa: Really? Why?  Reiji: Well, it's pretty abstract stuff.  He goes on to explain the main idea using translations of 3-D objects to 2 dimensions (like drawing a building on a piece of paper).  However, his summary would not be understood by most newbie students, I suspect:  Reiji: "Linear algebra is about translating something residing in an m-dimensional space into a corresponding shape in an n-dimensional space.  Say what? (If this was framed in a different way it may have been more convincing. Something like, "The fancy way of saying this is…, but that simply means …")  Most people want to know how they will use what they are studying. Misa asks the classic question (p17):  Misa: What exactly is it good for? Outside of academic interest, of course?  Reiji: You just had to ask me the dreaded question, didn't you? While it is useful for a multitude of purposes indirectly, such as earthquake proofing architecture, fighting diseases, protecting marine wildlife, and generating computer graphics… it doesn't stand too well on its own, to be honest…  … Like it or not, it's just one of those things you've got to know.  I feel the book would have been much stronger if it had been built around such practical examples, rather than concentrating on the (pure) math. Readers could still learn the theoretical concepts as a result of studying such examples. I'm not sure how many university students will be convinced by "it's just one of those things you've got to know".  What came across to me in these 2 vignettes is Reiji is uncomfortable talking about the "big picture" aspects. It would have been more satisfying if he was less apologetic about why this topic is included in many undergraduate programs.  Perhaps I'm being unfair here. Maybe my angst should be directed towards colleges who make topics such as Linear Algebra compulsory because "it's good for the students". This may be fine for math majors who have signed up because they love all sorts of math and don't mind what's offered, but for students studying other majors, they really should be given a good idea why they are doing it.  And yes, I know all students should have their thinking challenged and broadened at college level, but it needs to be done meaningfully.  Calculations  Sadly, the book concentrates too much on the calculations involved. Much of this calculation can, and should be done using computers, which then frees up time for everyone to learn the key concepts and how to apply them.  In the story, Misa is not a mathematics major. She, like many real students, ends up taking abstract courses like Linear Algebra with very little idea why, or when it will be useful to her. They learn it for the exam and promptly forget it.  It's not clear why Reiji launches into an explanation of complex numbers on page 25. Misa starts to become stressed, and Reiji says:  Reiji: I think it's be better if we avoided them for now since they might make it harder to understand the really important parts.  Exactly! Why even mention complex numbers (here) if they are not going to be used throughout the rest of the book?  The cofactor method is mentioned on p88, but Reiji says:  Reiji: The calculations invovled in cofactor method can very easily become cumbersome, so ignore it as long as you're not expecting it on a test.  Sadly, the message here is "Learn for tests".  Misa: If this is on the test, I'm done for.  Reiji: Don't worry, they are usually only 2×2 or 3×3.  So why confuse the poor girl with much larger examples?  Why do we learn Gaussian Elimination? On page 88, we have:  Reiji: In addition to finding inverse matrices, Gaussian Elimination can also be used to solve linear systems.  Fair enough. But after doing an example which involved solving a system of equations, he says (p89):  Reiji: Gaussian Elimination is about trying to get this part here [pointing to the right hand side of the working] to approach the identity matrix, not about solving for variables.  This would leave many first-time students somewhat unsatisfied and confused. So why are we doing it again?  Pages 98 to 105 contain some really pointless – and complicated – calculation rules. Sarrus' Rule is particularly untidy. I say "pointless" because evaluating determinants is exactly the kind of thing we should let computers do. I say "untidy" because for non-mathematicians, there are hundreds of steps involved, many patterns to recognize and remember, and way too many places to make a mistake. And in this work, a mistake early on can bubble down through the whole problem. (Yes, students should learn to be accurate and to check their work. But matrix operations are universally disliked because they are tedious, prone to many mistakes and should be done using software in the first place.)  Here the message that comes across is "Math is about calculation".  Should have more…  Throughout the book there are interesting practical examples, but they are only briefly mentioned. I'd like to see more examples and more space devoted to examples involving:  Enlargements & rotations using matrices  Linear transformations with graphs (e.g. p 212)  Area of parallelogram (p 97) using determinants.  Volume parallelpiped using 3×3 determinant.  Who is the audience?  I enjoy the Manga Guides concept, but I wonder how many math teachers would assign this as a text? (I wouldn't, since the math is too calculation-based).  How many students would buy it?  The Preface says it's for:  University students about to take linear algebra  Those who've taken it in the past but don't understand it still  High school students who are aiming to enter a technical university  Anyone else with a sense of humor and an interest in mathematics!  I put myself in the latter category. I did enjoy the story!  Let me know if you have bought books in the Manga Guides series and are in any of the above categories. What was your experience learning from the book?  Conclusion  I feel that the Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has missed the mark somewhat. The story line and artwork are very good, but concentrating on the calculation aspects of the math at the expense of the "big picture" aspects was a disappointment.  Share this page  2 Comments on "Manga Guide to Linear Algebra – Review"  I bought this book because I have an interest in math & have a sense of humor. Or more likely a complete fear of mathematics since my encounter with differential equations! But now I'm heading to grad school, and the stuff I'm really interested in will deal with vector calculus and differential topology. So, I thought I'd at least learn what linear algebra was via comics. Seemed to work for me when the comic version of Bible came out in the 1980′s.  Was I entertained while reading about linear algebra? Sure, probably much more so than if I just bought a book about it. I did learn some things about it, but the book just didn't cover a lot of "why". So, while not the best introduction to the subject, they did cover enough of the basics that I'll remember what things are.

__label__0 Specification  Aims  to supply evidence that such problems are both intriguing and provocative, and require rigorous proof;  to explain the fundamental ideas of sets, numbers and functions;  to compare and contrast language and logic;  to introduce a detailed study of the integers, including prime numbers and modular arithmetic;  to show how mathematicians generalize ideas, so unique factorization of integers is shown to hold for permutations;  to introduce the ideas of algebraic structures and so show, by examples throughout the course, how the same structure can arise in many different situations.  Brief Description of the unit  This course introduces students to the concept of proof, by studying sets, numbers and functions from a rigorous viewpoint. These topics underlie most areas of modern mathematics, and recur regularly in years 2, 3, and 4. The logical content of the material is more sophisticated than that of many A-level courses, and the aim of the lectures is to enhance students' understanding and enjoyment by providing a sequence of interesting short-term goals, and encouraging class participation.  Learning Outcomes  On completion of this unit successful students will be able to:  analyze statements using truth tables;  construct simple proofs including proofs by contradiction and proofs by induction;  prove statements about sets and functions;  prove standard results about countable sets;  apply Euclid 's Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of pairs of integers and to solve linear Diophantine equations;  to solve simultaneous linear congruences;  multiply and factorize permutations;  prove the infinitude of prime numbers, prove Fermat's Little Theorem and use it to find modular inverses and to solve linear congruences;  construct multiplication tables for congruence classes, reduced congruence classes and sets of permutations.

__label__0 MAA Review  In a 1990 paper entitled "What Is Geometry?" Shiing-Shen Chern [3] identified six pivotal developments in the history of geometry:  Euclid's axiomatic treatment,  the introduction of coordinates (Fermat and Descartes),  the invention of the calculus (Newton and Leibniz),  the recognition of the fundamental role of transformation groups (Klein and Lie),  manifolds (Riemann), and  fiber bundles (E. Cartan and Whitney).  The geometry presently taught in American high schools includes significant parts of (1) and (2), and some students get an introduction to (3). Transformations (4) make a cameo appearance in many contemporary American high school geometry textbooks, and play a featured role in a few. (5) and (6) have not influenced the high school curriculum.  The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, which have now been adopted as a guide for the K–12 mathematics curriculum in 44 states, put transformations in center stage. Students in Grade 8 are introduced to geometry by experimenting with rotations, reflections and translations and they are expected to understand congruence in terms of rigid motions. High-school students develop these ideas more rigorously, learning standard terminology and fundamental facts about rigid motions and dilations of the plane as a foundation for the study of Euclidean geometry. In giving such prominence to transformations, the authors of the Common Core took into account both pedagogical evidence as well as the structure of the mathematics underlying the curriculum. Nonetheless, in view of the traditional organization of the curriculum, this is one of the bolder proposals of the Common Core.  The challenge will be implementation. We will need K–12 textbooks that are very different from those most widely used. At least as important will be assuring that teachers are intellectually equipped. Good scholarship presented in a form accessible to teachers (or those planning to become teachers) and focused on the meaning and role of transformations in geometry is needed. One would hope to find this in textbooks for junior/senior-level college geometry courses, but unfortunately few books fill the bill. There is no standard undergraduate course in geometry, and the available textbooks have less in common than the books for courses such as abstract algebra or basic analysis that have acquired a canonical form. Geometry textbooks tend either to present some kind of axiomatic treatment and then to branch off into topics or else to be, through and through, a sampling of approaches and ideas. Transformations tend to be treated in college in the same way that they are treated in high school, namely, as an interesting branch of a great tree.  The purpose of the book of Barker and Howe is to develop the main ideas about geometric transformations of the Euclidean plane and their applications. It could play a valuable role in introducing college students, especially future teachers, to this topic. However, it does not jump immediately to its main topic. Chapter I, which takes up the first 120 pages of the 529 pages of this text, is devoted to a careful development of Euclidean plane geometry based on an axiom system similar to SMSG, which features the Ruler and Protractor Postulates. This opening chapter sets the mathematical tone. It is careful, rigorous, thorough and explicit in its attention to detail. I expect that this would not only be a good book from which learn some geometry, but also a fine introduction to the habits of logical thinking and precise exposition that a math major needs to acquire.  Transformations make their first appearance in Chapter II, which culminates on pages 157–161 by classifying the isometries of the plane according to the number of their fixed points, demonstrating that every isometry is a composite of at most three reflections, and proving that, for any pair of congruent triangles, there is an isometry that takes one to the other. Readers who are familiar with these theorems might wonder if 160 pages of preparation are needed. The main ideas in the proofs are intuitively clear, and can be conveyed vividly by well-designed paper-folding activities. But what a student will take away from an informal presentation is very different from what he or she might acquire by following the course that the book lays out. Paper-folding, whatever legitimate pedagogical purposes it may serve, does not equip learners with a useful language for reasoning about transformations. This book will provide plenty of opportunity to learn good mathematical language and practice its use.  Chapter III begins with a discussion of compositions of reflections and the kinds of plane isometries that may be produced, leading up to the classification of isometries as reflections, rotations, translations or glide reflections on page 188. Numerous fine color illustrations make the twenty pages of preparation for this theorem a delightful visual experience. This is followed by a discussion of orientation based on the proposition that the parity of an isometry is well-defined. The chapter then introduces the idea of a group of transformations and in a sequence of exercises beginning on page 203 invites readers to investigate the structure of many examples. The remainder of the chapter deals with factorization in the plane isometry group.  Chapter IV concerns similarities. This chapter is especially important for future teachers because of the prominence of similarities in high-school mathematics. The treatment here parallels the treatment of isometries in the previous chapters, building up to the structure and classification theorems.  Chapter V studies the conjugacy relation in transformation groups and the decomposition of groups into conjugacy classes. This chapter ends with an interesting but sketchy discussion of the idea of developing geometry from the group of symmetries alone by means of the correspondences between lines and reflections and between points and 180-degree rotations. As a matter of fact, this is an idea that was developed extensively in the early 20th century by German-speaking mathematicians Gerhard Hessenberg, Johannes Hjelmslev and Gerhard Thomsen; see [4]. The standard reference is Friedrich Bachmann's book [1]. Unfortunately, the works of Hessenberg, Hjelmslev and Thomsen have not been translated into English, nor has Bachmann's book. However, a good synopsis in English is contained in chapter 5 of [2].  Chapter VI describes applications of transformations to Euclidean plane geometry. Running from page 287 to 346, it includes numerous interesting results. Transformations appear sometimes as essential tools, sometimes as useful aids, sometimes as a way to interpret a construction and sometimes merely as a point of view. Section 2 describes some theorems on the concurrence of special lines in triangles.  The first theorem on the circumcenter (the point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC) helps to illustrate my remark about the varying role of transformations. The proof is essentially as follows: Let w be the perpendicular bisector of segment AB and let u be the perpendicular bisector of segment BC. Let P be the point of intersection of w and u. Then P is equidistant from A and B because it's on w and also P is equidistant from B and C because it's on u. Therefore, P is equidistant from A and C, so P lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AC. Transformations illuminate the argument — w and u are axes of reflections and it is these reflections that show the congruence of segments AP, BP and CP — but certainly it is not necessary to know this to follow the proof.  The incenter, centroid and orthocenter are treated in a similar fashion, using arguments in which the role of transformations is clear, illuminating but not essential. Section 3 uses dilation about the centroid by a factor of –2 to unify a discussion of the Euler line and the nine point circle. Here, the transformation does some real work. Section 5 of this chapter concerns the orthocenter (the point of concurrence of the altitudes). The discussion hinges on the analysis of the composition of the reflections whose axes are the sides of a triangle. Here, transformations are not only hard at work, but are leading the development.  Chapters VI (pages 347–375) concerns the symmetries of bounded figures in the plane, leading up to a discussion of dihedral groups. Chapter VII (pages 376–458) is a careful treatment of frieze and wallpaper groups. The last chapter concerns area, volume and scaling.  I had hoped to use this book in a one-semester course in geometry that I teach periodically, but up till now the scheduling has not worked out. The course is populated primarily by math majors who are seeking certification as secondary teachers. Most of these people take a proof-based course in real analysis as well as other junior/senior courses, including probability, abstract algebra, number theory and other advanced topics. The typical student in this group will likely struggle at first with the level of exposition in Continuous Symmetry, particularly if he or she has not previously taken the analysis course, but surely will be capable of handling it. Because the text is detailed and methodical, patience and persistence is needed. However, it clear and explicit enough that it will never leave students helpless or befuddled, provided they are serious and spend the time to read carefully.  I plan to use the text next time I teach the class. I expect to have to pick and choose carefully, especially in the first chapter. I find the level of rigor of Euclid to be a very workable goal in this class. It does not pay off to be overly concerned with facts, such as the Crossbar Theorem, that are evident from the topological properties of diagrams. I think the geometry of the number line is an essential topic, and a good opening for the course. This is consistent with the layout of the book.  My goal will be to spend only enough time in chapter I to prepare for chapters II, III and IV. These, I want to treat carefully because of the tasks these future high-school teachers will face in the classrooms where they will eventually teach. I shall need to include some material on area and volume, and Chapter IX can support this. Some discussion of coordinates, particularly linear change of coordinates, will be desirable. For this, I shall need to supplement the book. R. Hartshorne has made some observations about conventions related to the Ruler Postulate in a review of this book that appeared recently in the American Mathematical Monthly. Anyone who plans to use the book should be aware of his remarks.  Although I have mentioned them only once, the abundant, high-quality illustrations throughout the text are one of the most attractive features.  The book does not always choose the quickest or most elegant route to a result. For example, Proposition IX.2.14 on the area of a parallelogram could have been proved more elegantly by repeating Euclid's proof of Proposition 35 of Book 1 of the Elements. Nevertheless, I learned a lot by reading the book, mainly because the material is arranged in a manner that invites and inspires one to reflect about the connections among the ideas being discussed. It is thought-provoking throughout. If a textbook is meant to be a tool for learning, then the extent to which it makes one think in the manner of a mathematician is by far the most important feature — much more important than any quibbles about the slickness of a proof. I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to use this book in my classes.

__label__0 Algebra World – An Introduction  Algebra World software will turn struggling students into successful math learners and average students into accelerated math learners!  Algebra World teaches and reinforces introductory algebra concepts and meets NCTM standards. Mathematics topics have series of lessons and real world examples that accompany them. Equations and their relationship to word problems are emphasized throughout the program.  The major topics covered in Algebra World are: Expressions, Variables, Algebra Notation, Pattern Recognition, Integers, One Variable Equations, Two Step Equations, Ratio, Proportion and Percent, and Geometry. Each topic has a series of detailed lessons designed to teach key mathematical concepts. The lessons are followed by challenges in three skill levels that assess understanding of the subject and mathematical reasoning ability.  MathRealm's research showed that students are not as responsive to long narrations in software as they are to interactive visuals and audio effects that draw them into the program as active learners, rather than passive listeners.  Hands-on virtual manipulatives with limited text reading and immediate visual feedback will capture your students' attention and help them understand concepts, as well as develop logical reasoning.

__label__0 DVD Review: The Basic Math Word Problem Tutor and The Algebra 2 Tutor  Math has never been a particularly strong suit of mine. Everything started going downhill after long division, and I was well lost by the time multiplying and dividing fractions rolled around, let alone algebra. It was with some fear and trembling that I found The Algebra 2 Tutor - 6 Hour Video Course from MathTutorDVD in the mail. The Basic Math Word Problem Tutor - 8 Hour Video Course I felt confident in my ability to conquer, but the algebra — it scared me. It wasn't even Algebra 1, but an advanced level!  Thankfully instructor/owner Jason Gibson's highly visual, common sense approach to math made algebra seem within even my limited grasp. In each video course Gibson breaks down mathematical concepts by dividing and conquering. Each math topic, whether it be algebra, word problems or his other DVDs on calculus, physics, etc. divides the topic into sub-topics, each of which is worked through in an ascending level of complexity through abundant problems drawn out on a white board. Avoiding lengthy lectures, Gibson gets down to basics and explores the necessary connections while working out problems at the board. In fact, most of what you'll see is the back of his head; he turns to instruct and give detail, but most of his explanations are interwoven with real problems.  His thorough breakdown of concepts is best demonstrated by sharing the outline of the courses

"...a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor..." - The New Yorker (1983 National Book Award edition) Mathematics has been a human activity for thousands of years. Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding. This edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications.

__label__0 AO2: Relate tables, graphs, and equations to linear and simple quadratic relationships found in number and spatial patterns.  We have available a large range of activities that can be used for developing some basic concepts in algebra. Students often complain that they cannot see the point of learning algebra so all of the teaching of skills here is placed within contexts. The intention of this unit is not to teach skills in isolation, but rather to use each activity for developing all the concepts. It is not suggested that this unit should replace the skills practice traditionally used in the teaching of algebra. It does, however, provide the opportunities for discussion and development of concepts. As each learning outcome is explored there will probably be need for consolidation through more traditional exercises. With the first activities one will probably not wish to explore all aspects with the whole class, but the possibility is there for extending individuals. It would also be appropriate to use the first activity for diagnostic assessment.  The initial focus of this unit involves students in gathering data from their investigation of squares that can be made on different sized geoboards, (an array of dots arranged on a square grid). Students need to be systematic in their work, and to record their results in ways that are likely to help them notice patterns and relationships.  Techniques for drawing linear graphs are introduced via whole number problem situations where the focus is on the solutions rather than the technique. Only linear equations of the form ax±by=c are graphed by finding two or more points on the line. No attempt is made to link these equations by algebra to the gradient intercept form y=mx+c.

__label__0 A Journey in Algebraic Thinking  The United States is one of the only countries in the world that is teaching courses with names like Algebra I or Algebra II. The rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school. In the United States, some schools offer an alternative, such as an integrated program that incorporates algebra as a strand blended with geometry and other advanced topics. Others continue to offer a course sequence that includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. In an increasing number of states, the study of algebra in some form is required of all students for high school graduation. Regardless of whether a school's secondary curriculum includes a separate course in Algebra I or is more integrated, we can take concrete steps to ensure that students will flourish and succeed when they arrive at the formal study of algebra. A key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.  Algebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change. Of course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems. But trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure. Algebraic thinking can begin when students begin their study of mathematics.  At the earliest grades, young children work with patterns. At an early age, children have a natural love of mathematics, and their curiosity is a strong motivator as they try to describe and extend patterns of shapes, colors, sounds, and eventually letters and numbers. And at a young age, children can begin to make generalizations about patterns that seem to be the same or different. This kind of categorizing and generalizing is an important developmental step on the journey toward algebraic thinking.  Throughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well. As students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3. As they explore and understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they can look for patterns that help them learn procedures and facts. Patterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense. Patterns within the multiplication table itself are interesting to children and help them both learn their facts and understand relationships among facts. The process of noticing and exploring patterns sets the stage for looking at more complex relationships, including proportionality, in later grades.  As students move into the middle grades, their mathematics experience can focus on connecting their work with numbers and operations to more symbolic work with equations and expressions. At this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum. This concept should take students well beyond the study of ratios, proportions, and percent. A real understanding of proportionality allows students to connect their experience with numbers and operations to ideas that they have studied in geometry, measurement, and data analysis. They begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.  A solid understanding of proportionality sets the stage for students to succeed in the more formal study of algebra. From this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally. As students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them. Looking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.  The journey doesn't end with a student's first formal study of algebra at high school. Continuous development of increasingly sophisticated algebraic reasoning can provide an avenue into the study of geometry and advanced mathematics. In the world outside school, these topics are not separated. When higher-level courses regularly incorporate opportunities to build on students' algebraic understanding, students are far more likely to succeed than if the courses present just one mathematical perspective.  The development of algebraic thinking is a process, not an event. It is something that can be part of a positive, motivating, enriching school mathematics experience. "Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year. Watch for opportunities to develop your own understanding of this important topic throughout the year, including as part of conferences, journals, publications, and the NCTM Web site.  For this month's questions, consider the following: How can we build algebraic thinking into the pre-K–12 curriculum at all levels? How should secondary school mathematics be organized to capitalize on the inclusion of algebraic thinking throughout the elementary and middle grades? What can NCTM do to support teachers in fostering the development of algebraic thinking?
__label__0 Calcul is your calculator and nobody else's: like most other calculator applications, it has a number of function buttons, which perform specific calculations on the number entered or calculated. But unlike in other applications, the buttons in My Calcul can be programmed by you to do exactly the calculations you want. You are free to set the name of each function button and the calculation formula behind it.  The calculation formula behind each button can take several named variables and an unlimited number of parenthesis. In the case of function ft-in>cm, the formula has 2 variables named inches and feet :  Main features of My Calcul :  * the calculation formulae can have up to 255 characters, with an unlimited number of parenthesis and named variables. The last value of each variable is memorized within one session, and it is offered as default value when the same variable is used again, in the same formula or in another formula. * the following functions are recognized in formulae: log, ln, factorial, sin, cos, tan, acos, asin, atan, cosh, sinh, acosh, asinh. The numbers pi and e are also recognized. * the calculator can operate in standard algebraic mode or in RPN mode (Reverse Polish Notation).  My Calcul features an equation solver module. When the user loads an equation with n variables (up to 6), the application automatically builds up a table with one line per variable. The table can be used like a small spreadsheet where the user enters values for any sub-set of n-1 variables and let the application calculate the value of the nth variable to solve the equation. Each cell in this special kind of spreadsheet is both an input cell and a calculated cell. This is very useful for all sorts of "what if" type calculations.

__label__0 Message is for any parent who wants to give A Great Mathematics Education to their middle or high school level child in 2013.  Please forward and share this message with any parent you know who is not already achieving this noble goal.  This will be of special interest to any parent whose child is not thriving on math, or who is struggling teaching their child the standard mathematics curriculum that is offered in virtually all regular math programs and books.  These are short books that can each be read in less than an hour, but don't let that fool you. They can be transformative. These two amazing books explain in depth why a student and/or teacher may be struggling with math, and exactly how to correct and transform the situation.  The first book you should read is entitled "Math? Help! How to Find Interactive, Online Math in Algebra, Geometry & Trigonometry for Teens & Adults" [Kindle Edition]. This is aimed at both the parent and the child or adult wishing to learn math.  The second book you will want to read is entitled: "How to Give Your Child a Great Math Education in Algebra, Geometry & Trigonometry" [Kindle Edition]. This book is aimed at the parent/teacher specifically.  These books are authored by Dr. Craig Hane, a long time successful math teacher you may learn all about at  Dr. Hane's mission or "crusade" is to be sure any student is given a post-elementary mathematics education that is appropriate for the child, and that the child be very successful. He knows how this can be done, and shares this insight with you in these two books we are giving you.  After reading these two books, you will be invited to engage in a longer term relationship with Dr. Hane by joining his Matheracy Crusade, and benefiting from many free materials he will share with you and then possibly buy some amazing mathematics educational resources he has created. But, not until you understand the situation we are all in thoroughly, which you will after reading these two books.  So, please pass this along to any parent who is not completely satisfied with the mathematics program they are delivering their middle or high school level child, and wants to be more than satisfied.

__label__0 Get to know your calculator early in any math course. Calculators are used for most routine arithmetic calculations now, and your ability to use a calculator will help to complete work accurately and efficiently.  While calculators come in many different makes and model numbers, most of them operate in similar manners. The notes here are specifically intended to assist you in becoming familiar with the Texas Instruments' TI-30X or TI-30Xa, but you should find the same function keys on many other scientific calculator.  For most algebra courses, you will need a scientific calculator. A scientific calculator includes functions for LOG, LN, and exponents, among other useful keys. It also performs arithmetic according to the Order of Operations (a calculator with only the arithmetic operations +, -,, and ¸ probably performs operations sequentially and is not useful for any advanced mathematical work). The TI-30X calculators are scientific calculators.  Do not worry if there are several keys you don't understand right now. This calculator will serve you well throughout your math courses, even to Calculus and beyond. Anytime you learn some new mathematics, try to learn how to use your calculator to go with it.  Basic key operations  ON:  Know how to turn your calculator on and off (the solar model has no OFF; there are no batteries to conserve). Some calculators have an automatic shut off if not used for a few minutes. On the TI-30X, the ON button is the top right key. This is also the All Clear (AC) button, which effectively gives you a clean slate to work with. AC clears the screen to "0", clears all memories, and turns off special features (like statistical mode). Use AC only when you want a fresh start. Avoid using AC in the middle of an exercise.  AC/ON  2nd  DRG  LOG  LN  CE/C  HYP  SIN  COS  TAN  yx  p  1/x  x2  S  +  EE  (  )  ¸  STO  7  8  9  ´  RCL  4  5  6  -  a  b/c  1  2  3  +  ®  0  .  +/-  =  Primary functions:  Every key has a number, operation or function name printed on top of the button. This is the primary function for that key. These are likely the ones you will use most often. The primary functions are grouped, more or less, according to purpose.  Numeric keys  These are the keys for entering numbers digit-by-digit. Use the key for entering a number with a decimal point, like 2.57. Use the key to change the sign of a number from positive to negative, or vice versa. This is most useful for entering negative numbers: simply type in the number, then press to make it negative. It is important to use the negative sign after typing the number, because -0 is just 0.  Arithmetic Operations  ¸  ´  -  +  =  These are the basic operations of (from top to bottom) division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. These may be typed in the order written in an exercise, and the calculator will automatically perform the entire calculation according to the required order of operations once the key is pressed. Use the key only at the end of your calculation, and press it exactly once (no more).  Note that multiplication may be written with the symbols * or × as well as ´ . Multiplication may also be written with no symbol between numbers or parentheses; be sure to type in this case. Likewise, division may be written as ¸ or /. A fraction bar also indicates division.  Include parentheses (as written) in any arithmetic exercise. The parentheses keys may be used for any pair of grouping symbols, including "(...)" or "[...]" or "{...}". Type the parentheses just as they appear in your exercise. You may also need parentheses at times when they are not shown. For example, a fraction with more than just a number in the numerator or denominator may be enclosed in parentheses for quick entry. Try to compute by typing .  (  )  The correct answer is 7.  Error correction Keys  As described earlier, the button clears all previous entries and settings. Use this key when you start, but rarely afterwards. In the middle of calculations, is a better option. Pressed once, this key means "Clear Error". Use it to correct an incorrect number as you type during a longer entry. For example, suppose you are trying to calculate 28 (16) + 42, and you typed (but you notice this should have been 16, not 26). Press once to clear just the last number entry. Then type in the correct entry and the rest of the calculation: . You should get the answer 490.  If you typed well beyond the mistake, then press twice (to activate "Clear"). This clears the entire calculation from the screen, so you can start over. For example, in the above calculation, suppose you typed before noticing that the 26 should have been 16. Press and start over: .  ®  One other option (and a good one), is to make use of the backspace key. This key erases only the last digit typed. Press it once or more to get back to the mistaken digit, and then resume your calculation. Having typed , press the backspace twice, then continue with 16 to get the correct answer. Note that the backspace will only erase digits, not operations.  1/x  x2  yx  Exponent and Root Keys  Your calculator also has keys for performing any exponent calculations. The simplest of these is perhaps the key, which squares the number currently displayed on the screen. Enter the base number first, then press . The result is displayed immediately. Try 92 by typing ; the answer is 81. Try 162 on your own (the answer is 256).  The opposite of squaring is the square root. gives the square root of the number currently displayed on the screen. Try out and .  gives the reciprocal of the number on the screen. Literally, this is 1 divided by x. Mathematically, 1/x is also the same as x-1. On some calculators, the key is . For example, to quickly change 1/200 to a decimal, type . The screen will show 0.005. Likewise, to find 50-1, type to get 0.02.  Finally, the calculator also has a key for doing more general exponents (all three of the above can be done with the exponent key, but they have special easy to use buttons because they are so commonly used). The exponent key is (find it just above the division key). Essentially, pressing this key tells the calculator that the next number you input will be an exponent for the number already on the screen. One nice feature is that the exponent can be any possible number (integer, fraction, decimal, or even another calculation enclosed in parentheses). Always enter the base number first, followed by the exponent key, and then the exponent. Press the key after entering the exponent (or continue the rest of the calculation if there is more). For example, find 210 by typing (the answer is 1024). To compute 0.2-3 type (answer is 125). Note that the negative exponent is entered by typing 3 followed by the key.  Memory Keys  STO  RCL  The memory keys allow you to save up to three different numbers for later use. To save the number currently on the display, type . This "stores" the value in memory cell 1 (replace with or to use memories 2 or 3, respectively). To "recall" a number stored in memory cell 1, use . To try this out, let's compute x2 - 17x + 5, using the memory cell 1 for x when x = -3.217. First enter the number, change the sign to negative, and store it in cell 1 as follows: . Then type in the computation, using for each occurrence of the variable x:  Do not forget to include the "times" symbol between "17" and "x" in the middle term. The answer displayed should be 70.038089.  By substituting or for after , you can use up to three values for use in a single calculation. The memory cells are especially useful if you have a lengthy number (avoid copying and retyping) or if you expect to use the same number several times.  a b/c  The Fraction Key  Perhaps one of the nicest features of this particular calculator is its ability to work fraction arithmetic. When properly entered, the calculator will use fractions correctly in any calculation. First, you need to know how to enter a fraction.  Single fraction: Enter the numerator (top number), press the fraction key , then enter the denominator (bottom number). So the fraction is entered as . The calculator displays the fraction something like .  Mixed numbers: Use the fraction key twice. The mixed number is entered as . In short, simply press the fraction key between each number in a fraction or mixed number. Your calculator knows the difference. The mixed number is displayed as .  Now you are ready to use fractions in other calculations. Simply enter the fraction wherever it appears as you continue typing the entire calculation. For example, try computing by entering the following sequence:  The answer will be displayed as a fraction or a mixed number (if more than 1). In this case, you should get , which means .  Secondary Functions and the Key.  You have probably noticed by now that the calculator also has writing just above each key. To save space, the calculator was made so that each key can perform two separate functions. The primary function is labeled directly on the key as is used simply by pressing the desired key (everything we have discussed so far is a primary function). To activate a secondary function, first press and then the key below the name of the desired function. A few commonly used secondary functions are, , and .  finds roots of any index. This is really just the opposite of the exponent key. Enter the number under the radical, press the key, then enter the index of the root. Press if finished, or continue the calculation. To compute , enter . Note that the key changes the meaning of the key to . You should get 12 for the answer.  Above the fraction key is the improper fraction function . This is nice for converting a mixed number into a pure fraction (although called improper, a single fraction with any numerator and denominator is usually easier to use in algebraic expressions than the equivalent mixed number). In the section on fractions, we did a calculation that gave the answer . This can be converted to a pure fraction by pressing , which activates the secondary function and displays the fraction . Written as a fraction rather than a mixed number, the answer is .  Another related secondary function is , above the backspace key. The label stands for Fraction-to-Decimal. By pressing this key, any fraction on the displayed will be changed to its decimal form. If the display is a decimal number, the calculator will try to write the number as a fraction, but this is not always possible. So if the decimal number remains, then there is no simple equivalent fraction (remember that the calculator can only do fractions with 3-digit numbers). For example, convert to a decimal just by pressing . You should see 4.6 on the display. Press again to change the answer back to fraction form (you get because the calculator prefers mixed number form). Press to get back to the pure fraction form .  DRG  LOG  LN  HYP  SIN  COS  TAN  Most everything else  are keys you won't be needing until a College Algebra or Calculus course or beyond. You will learn about the keys for the logarithmic and trigonometric functions later. Most of the secondary function keys are used for probability and statistics.  Calculator Exercises  Use a calculator to compute each of the following. When the answer is a fraction, give the answer in (a) mixed number form and (b) fraction from.

Furthermore, the text incorporates programming material in both FORTRAN and C. The breadth of topics, such as partial differential equations, systems of nonlinear equations, and matrix algebra, provide comprehensive and flexible coverage of all aspects of numerical analysis.  This is a thoroughly revised edition of a classic basic statistics text, ideal for students with a good mathematics background who are starting to learn statistics. This fourth edition includes a chapter on multiple regression, has additional material on acceptance sampling, and places greater emphasis on graphical methods of data analysis. Like earlier editions, it is packed with examples, exercises, and larger projects, including plenty of computing exercises in Minitab. [via]  S-PLUS is a powerful tool for interactive data analysis, creating graphs, and implementing customized routines. Originating as the S language of AT&T Bell Laboratories, its modern language and flexibility make it appealing to data analysts from many scientific fields. This book explains the basics of S-PLUS in a clear style at a level suitable for people with little computing or statistical knowledge. Unlike the S-PLUS manuals, it is not comprehensive, but instead introduces the most important ideas of S-PLUS through the use of many examples. Each chapter also includes a collection of exercises which are accompanied by fully worked-out solutions and detailed comments. The volume is rounded off with practical hints on how efficient work can be performed in S-PLUS. The book is well-suited for self-study and as a textbook. [via]  Nicholas Lemann's The Big Test starts off as a look at how the SAT became an integral part of the college application process by telling the stories of men like Henry Chauncey and James Bryant Conant of Harvard University, who sought in the 1930s and '40s to expand their student base beyond the offspring of Brahmin alumni. When they went into the public schools of the Midwest to recruit, standardized testing gave them the means to select which lucky students would be deemed most suitable for an Ivy League education. But about a third of the way through the book, Lemann shifts gears and writes about several college students from the late '60s and early '70s. The reasons for the change-up only become clear in the final third, when those same college students, now in their 40s, lead the fight against California's Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot initiative aimed at eliminating affirmative action programs.  Do these two stories really belong together? For all his storytelling abilities--and they are prodigious--Lemann is not entirely persuasive on this point, especially when he identifies the crucial moment in the civil rights era when "affirmative action evolved as a low-cost patch solution to the enormous problem of improving the lot of American Negroes, who had an ongoing, long-standing tradition of deeply inferior education; at the same time American society was changing so as to make educational performance the basis for individual advancement." Lemann's muddled transition is somewhat obscured by frequent digressions (every new character gets a lengthy background introduction), but a crucial point gets lost in the shuffle, only to reappear fleetingly at the conclusion: "The right fight to be in was the fight to make sure that everybody got a good education," Lemann writes, not to continue to prop up a system that creates one set of standards for privileged students and another set for the less privileged. If The Big Test had focused on that issue, where equal opportunity is genuinely at stake, instead of on the roots of standardized testing, where opportunity was explicitly intended only for a chosen few, it would be a substantially different book--one with a story that almost assuredly could be told as engrossingly as the story Lemann chose to tell, but perhaps with a sharper focus. --Ron Hogan[via]  More editions of The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy:  George Thomas' clear precise calculus text with superior applications defined the modern-day calculus course.

The authors have included examples of applying these methods in various applications in both the independent and identically distributed (iid) case and in more complicated cases with non-iid data sets. Readers are assumed to have a reasonable knowledge of mathematical statistics and so this will be made suitable reading for graduate students, researchers and practitioners seeking a wide-ranging survey of this important area of statistical theory and application. [via]  The development of statistical theory in the past fifty years is faithfully reflected in the history of the late Sir Maurice Kendalls volumes The Advanced Theory of Statistics. The Advanced Theory began life as a two volume work (Volume 1, 1943; Volume 2, 1946) and grew steadily, as a single authored work until the late fifties. At that point Alan Stuart became involved and the Advanced Theory was rewritten in three volumes. When Keith Ord joined in the early eighties, Volume 3 became the largest and plans were developed to expand it into a series of monographs called the Kendall's Library of Statistics which would devote a book to each of the modern developments in statistics. This series is well on the way with 5 titles in print and a further 7 on the way. A new volume on Bayesian Inference was also commissioned from Tony O'Hagan and published in 1994 as Volume 2B of the Advanced Theory. This Volume 2A is therefore the completely updated Volume 2 - Classical Inference and Relationship. A new author, Steven Arnold, was invited to join Keith Ord and they have between them produced a work of the highest quality. References have been updated and material revised throughout. A new chapter on the linear model and least squares estimation has been added.

"On the Shoulders of Giants" [via]  More editions of On the Shoulders of Giants: New Approaches to Numeracy:Here is a unified, readable introduction to multipredictor regression methods in biostatistics, including linear models for continuous outcomes, logistic models for binary outcomes, the Cox model for right-censored survival times, and generalized linear models for counts and other outcomes. The authors describe shared elements in methods for selecting, estimating, checking, and interpreting each model, and show that these regression methods deal with confounding, mediation, and interaction of causal effects in essentially the same wayThis book introduces you to the study of statistics and data analysis by using real data and attention-grabbing examples. The authors guide you through an intuition-based learning process that stresses interpretation and communication of statistical information. They help you grasp concepts and cement your comprehension by using simple notation-frequently substituting words for symbols. [via]  This book is written for the introductory statistics course and students majoring in any field. It is written in an approachable, informal style that invites students to think about how to reason when data is available. Stats: Data and Models (SDM), as compared to Intro Stats, offers Math Boxes, which present the mathematical underpinnings of the statistical methods and concepts, and advanced topics (Ch. 28-31) that are often covered in a two-semester course, plus the inclusion of non-parametrics. SDM carries a core focus on statistical thinking and understanding analyses throughout the text, emphasizing how statistics helps us to understand the world. The book also recognizes the central role that technology plays in statistics. SDM is organized into short teachable chapters that focus on one topic at a time, offering instructors flexibility in selecting topics while students receive digestible chunks of information that build on previous material before moving on. [via]  Designed for medical students, junior doctors, practising physicians, and indeed anyone who reads medical literature, this book acts as a guide to how to read and digest the information presented in medical literature.

Refined and updated since the seventh edition, this unique work has become as standard reference book for scholars, journalists, politicians, civil servants, students and all readers with an interest in political history.  Scientists have recently discovered a new law of nature. Its footprints are virtually everywhere - in the spread of forest fires, mass extinctions, traffic jams, earthquakes, stock-market fluctuations, the rise and fall of nations, and even trends in fashion, music and art. Wherever we look, the world is modelled on a simple template: like a steep pile of sand, it is poised on the brink of instability, with avalanches - in events, ideas or whatever - following a universal pattern of change. This remarkable discovery heralds what Mark Buchanan calls the new science of 'ubiquity', a science whose secret lies in the stuff of the everyday world. Combining literary flair with scientific rigour, this enthralling book documents the coming revolution by telling the story of the researchers' exploration of the law, their ingenious work and unexpected insights. Mark Buchanan reveals how the principle of ubiquity will help us to manage, control and predict the future. More controversially, he claims that it may well contain the beginnings of a mathematics of cultural and historical change. Every decade sees a major scientific breakthrough that has implications that go way beyond science. 'Ubiquity' is one of them. This book, the world's first on the topic, will change how we think about the world and our place in it. Chaos Disorder from order. Complexity Complexity from simplicity. UBIQUITY World has a natural 'rhythm': there is a mysterious archetypal organisation that works in the world at all levels and which gives rise to a universal pattern of change - in groups of people, things or ideas. [via]  More editions of Ubiquity: The Science of History . . . or Why the World Is Simpler Than We Think:  Readers of medical literature are often overwhelmed by the language of statistics and research methodology while trying to extract the best clinical evidence available. 'A-Z of Medical Statistics' is an essential medical statistics dictionary for non-statisticians, and is therefore an invaluable companion for reading medical literature and critically appraising what is read.Statistics and research methods explained in the book's user-friendly A - Z format allow the reader to locate the information required and avoid the time-consuming process of scanning through whole chapters for relevant information. The book provides clear and succinct explanations of those terms frequently encountered in medical statistics, clarifying their meaning and showing the inter-dependency between various important concepts.

__label__0 Math  Dr. Richard Newcomb, Head of Department  School mathematics should engage students in real mathematics. This view is at the center of the teaching and learning of mathematics at Cistercian. Every departmental course at Cistercian seeks to engage our students in both formal and informal modes of mathematical reasoning. The journey from arithmetic to calculus begins with Cistercian's Middle School mathematics curriculum. The focus here is first on developing the students' understanding of rational arithmetic and basic geometry. The second two years of the Middle School are considered together as serving the purpose of introducing algebra into the treatment of both arithmetic and geometry.  Mathematics in the Upper School begins with Euclid's geometry. Students need to learn geometry, not only because it is indispensable for all of applied mathematics, engineering, architecture, physics, and calculus, but even more importantly because it has simply speaking set the standard that any piece of reasoning must meet to be called a branch of mathematics. Forms VI and VII are a continuation of the earlier forms but the weaving of geometry and algebra is now more complete. Cistercian's mathematics curriculum culminates in Form VIII with a yearlong calculus course taught at the college level with a selection of material which also allows willing students to take the Advanced Placement exams in calculus.  At the same time, topics from discrete mathematics such as counting and probability are important and are included in each required course. Moreover, students wishing to delve deeper into these topics can take advantage of various mathematics electives in the Upper School as well as join Cistercian's Math Club or one of our many math teams.

What Makes Carnegie Learning Student Texts Engaging?  Learning By Doing Principles  Carnegie Learning believes that students develop math understanding and skills by taking an active role and responsibility for their own learning. With Carnegie Learning textbooks students become engaged in solving contextual math problems that strengthen their conceptual understanding of math topics. Rather than encouraging students to memorize procedures, we provide them opportunities to think and work together in small groups.  Real-World Context  Students work with their peers to solve real-world problem situations like using percents for leaving a tip in a restaurant or using a graph of an equation to determine the number of days it will take to build miles of highway. They become more engaged in learning mathematics when they see how it plays a significant role in everyday life.  Mathematical Discourse  Throughout the student text icons prompt different forms of student communication. These icons may instruct students to work independently, work with groups, or share ideas with the class. Encouraging mathematical discourse provides opportunities for students to explain their thoughts and processes for solving math problems.

__label__0 Math 8  Doug Ingamells, Periods 1, 2 & 6  All classes are composed of 7th and 8th graders. They are usually on the same page and assignment, except that they have different "block" days so assignment and due dates can differ. There are two other sections of Math 8, both taught by Kerry Bayne.  PPS has decided that the first four (of twelve total) chapters in the algebra text will be part of the Math 8 curriculum. This means that Algebra 1-2 now starts at Chapter 5, and students must complete the first four chapters before enrolling in Algebra 1-2. The district calendar has us completing the Algebra first, then proceeding with pre-algebra topics at the end of the year. All students in Math 8 should be in Algebra 1-2 the following year.  PPS uses standard A-F grades. In this class grades are weighted so that tests count 60% and homework/classwork counts 40%. We use the standard 90%(A), 80%(B), 70%(C), 60%(D) breakpoints.

__label__0 The four graphing modes provide a structure of the four sections of the book:  Using function graphing  You may well be familiar with the basics of this type of graph drawing but, unless you have spent many hours using your calculator in conjunction with its operating manual, you will undoubtedly find that there are graphing techniques in this section that are new to you and that are interesting and fun.  Using polar graphing  Units 4 and 5 form a short section involving the use of polar graphing. Polar coordinates are explained and you are shown how to produce spirals and other interesting shapes like the heart-shaped one shown here. This section could be studied independently of the rest of the book.  Using parametric graphing  After an introduction to this graphing mode in Unit 6, the next two units deal with applications in mechanics, and Units 9 and 10 with applications in pure mathematics. Each pair of units could be studied independently.  Using sequence graphing Unit 11 provides an introduction to iterative methods of defining sequences in general and the next four units cover time-sequence graphs, staircase and cobweb diagrams and phase plots. Units 11 to 16 are best worked through in order.  The DfEE in England and Wales published the Key Stage 3 National Strategy, Framework for teaching mathematics: Years 7, 8 and 9. Central to the Framework is the appropriate use of technology, particularly graphics calculators.  This book provides 30 lesson plans, each consisting of a page of teacher notes and one or more student handouts. These are written specifically for the Texas Instruments TI-83 or TI-83 Plus calculators. The teacher notes reflect the lesson structure suggested in the Framework: Starter à Main activity à Plenary session.  Also in the teacher notes is a section containing all the information needed to link the lesson to the National Strategy Framework document.  What calculator skills are needed? The lesson outlines assume a very basic level of competence with the calculator, particularly for the teacher. In every lesson there is reference to the teacher using a view-screen calculator as a sort of electronic blackboard for full-class teaching. Teachers who are not confident users of the calculator will find that a copy of Calculator Maths: Foundations Plus will help them acquire all the basic calculator skills that they will need for these 30 lessons. The other books in the Calculator Maths series are also a useful complement to this one, with lots more activities for use at Key Stages 3 and 4.  This new book is a companion to the very successful 30 Calculator Lessons. It has been written to motivate, challenge, entertain and enlighten students aged 11 to 16.  The new book provides another 30 plans for lessons, each consisting of a page of teacher notes and two more of student handouts. Once again, these are written specifically for the Texas Instruments TI-83 or TI-83 Plus calculators.  However, each of these lessons is based on a simple calculator program that students are encouraged to create for themselves.  Short programs This is certainly not a book of clever and complicated programs for teachers to dazzle the class with!  On the contrary, these photocopiable worksheets, help pupils to create their own short programs and show how they can be gradually built up from the bare bones of a skeleton version to something more sophisticated.

__label__0 Algebra 2A/B Syllabus  This course is an extensionBe reminded, Algebra 2 is NOT an introductory course and topics learned in Algebra 1 will not be rehashed but rather built upon. And, because all Indiana state universities and colleges require Algebra 2 for admission, this Algebra 2 course is taught at the college preparatory level and taught for proficiency on university admission tests.  Students will work to their potential and ultimately benefit from taking this class as borne out from recent SAT scores. Those who score well in algebera 2 do well on college admissions tests.  5.Graphing calculators – provided in class, will be used to aid in exploring Algebra; however graphers will not be used as a "crutch" for applications that students cannot perform on their own.  6. A positive attitude – "If there were one word that could be used to describe a successful person, that one word would be ATTITUDE." Bart Starr  Assignments/Make-up Work:  Homework will be assigned on a daily basis and generally due the following day (at the beginning of class). Though assignments are generally not graded, I retain the right to grade homework for completeness and effort, and at times for accuracy. Homework checks/pop quizzes will be given regularly. Problems from recent previous assignments will be given to the student at the beginning of class the next day, to complete in class with use of notes/binder/homework within a reasonable amount of time. Adequate time is allowed to complete the homework check provided the student has completed his or her assignment.  I expect every problem in each homework assignment to be given an honest attempt by you. Each problem should have logical work showneven though you are convinced that your work or answers are wrong. Anything less than an honest attempt is considered incomplete. A zero will be given for a homework assignment turned in with answers only, unless specified by your teacher.  Students will assume the responsibility to find out what work and notes you missed while absent and that you complete those tasks promptly. After your return to school, you will be allowed one day per day absent to complete all missing material. If you miss a homework check, then expect to turn in the appropriate assignment in its place. If you are absent the class before a test/quiz, expect to take the test/quiz on the regularly schedule day (this means you must review on your own). If you are absent the day of a test/quiz, expect to take the test/quiz on the 1st day you return.  Finally, you will receive at most, only half-credit for any late paper.  Classroom Policies:  1. Be respectful at all times (towards me, other faculty, and your classmates). I will respect you.  2. Be on time and prepared (have sharpened pencil, paper, homework, and calculator ready to go when the bell rings!)  3. Be responsible for all material discussed while you were absent on a field trip and upon return the next day, have completed all assignments due. PLAN AHEAD FOR FIELD TRIPS!!!  4. Be on task and use study/homework time to work exclusively on your math assignment. When your math assignment is completed you may then use that extra time to work on another assignment.  5. Be honest with your work on all assignments, projects, tests and quizzes whether graded or not. If you are found to have cheated, you will receive a zero for that grade, your CPG will be docked 5 points, and you will be referred for disciplinary action and a Friday night school.  6. All Manchester Jr/Sr High School rules apply.  Possible Consequences *:  1. Verbal warning  2. A meeting with Ms. Stone  3. Parents called  4. Loss of CPG points (see CPG contract)  5. Written referral  *Any serious infraction will be referred to the office immediately.  Grading:  Your individual midterm and semester grades depend on several different scores:  1. Tests (a major portion) 2. Announced Quizzes 3. Frequent Pop Homework checks 4. Homework—I reserve the right to grade any assignment. 5. CPG (a score out of 25 points)—recorded at end of semester 6. Extra-credit, recorded at the end of thesemester  Make-ups:  1. If you miss an ANNOUNCED quiz, your grade will be recorded as 0 out of 0. It does not count for or against your grade.  2. If you miss a POP homework check, then I will grade the homework assignment pertaining to the checked material.  3. IF YOU MISS CLASS DUE TO A FIELD TRIP OR PRE-ARRANGED ABSENCE, ALL HOMEWORK, QUIZZES, OR TESTS DUE ARE EXPECTED ON THE DAY YOU RETURN.Field trip participants ARE NOT CONSIDERED ABSENT!!!  4. For all others absences, you have one day for every day you missed to complete the outstanding assignments, tests or homework check. After such time, if the work is still missing, the grade will be recorded as a zero!  You will be expected to keep track of your own point totals. An assignment sheet is provided for that purpose. Grading Scale: (in percents)  Any "rounding" will be done on an individual basis. Attitude, effort, class participation, etc. will be considered in any rounding situation. .5% and above is not necessarily cause for me to automatically round up!  Semester Average = 80% from your total percent in a semester (including any extra credit and CPG) prior to the final exam  + 20 % from the final exam percent.  If a midterm grade is given, it will be based on your total points earned divided by the total points possible.  Extra credit and CPG are added in when determining the semester grade.  Extra Credit:  There will be minimal opportunities for extra credit. The best way to get extra credit is extra effort. Show me that you are working to your potential. Be an active participator in class. It won't go unnoticed.  HELP:  My job is to help you reach your potential. Your success in this class is vitally important to me. I am often available for extra assistance before each school day (7:45 AM, after each school day until 3:30 PM or later by appointment, and at home, via phone. Students are encouraged to call me at home (982-2949, prior to 8 pm) for extra help with their homework. Further assistance is available from peer tutors in the study hall , via the internet at the website listed on the front of your textbook. After school tutoring is available to all free of charge from 3:30-4:30 PM M-TH.There is also FREE homework assistance through Rose Hulman Institute at 1-877-ASK-ROSE (toll free) every Sunday – Thursday evenings, 7-10 PM, excluding any Rose Hulman breaks.  I want this class to challenge you, to satisfy your intellectual curiosity, and to fulfill your academic needs. You WILL have to work hard, but I can guarantee you that I will be working even harder to see you meet your goals. Let's make this a great school year by working together toward the common goals of academic success and maturity.

Two-tone illustrations help students really "see" the geometric concepts, while sidebars provide additional notes, hints, and topics to think about. Parents will be able to easily help their students with the solutions manual, which includes step-by-step solutions to each problem in the student book; and quickly assess performance with the test book (test answers included). Tests are designed to be administered after every five lessons after the first ten.
__label__0 Mathematics  To achieve the goal, the department develops and improves its curriculum integrating strengths of American, Japanese and other countries' curricula. In particular, American textbooks contain various types of basic practice problems, which help students build a solid foundation of each mathematical concept, while Japanese textbooks and problem solving books contain many problems requiring multiple steps for their solution, which help students develop ability to apply their knowledge to solve complex problems. Both American and Japanese textbooks are used. Indian textbooks are also used to take advantage of their clear and easy-to-understand presentation of proofs of theorems and formulas.  The curriculum is constructed taking the cognitive development of each student into account. In general, more abstract concepts are introduced at higher grade levels. At each grade level, students are placed in one of two to three levels that best fits their cognitive and mathematical development. The goal for each level is set so that students will feel that they can reach the goal if, but only if, they put effort into studying mathematics. Each grade level has the following goal:  9th Grade  In the 9th grade, all students are required to take the course "Algebra and Geometry." The goal of this course is to develop student competence to deal with mathematical expressions, the basic language of mathematics. In particular, the course is designed to develop students' fluency in algebraic manipulations with polynomials and irrational numbers and to develop the ability to construct geometric proofs. Students are placed in either an intermediate or an honors level class, based on the results of a placement test. The course includes the following topics: Equations, Inequalities, Exponents and Polynomials, Polynomials and Factoring, Systems of Equations, Radical Expressions and Equations, Relations and Functions, Quadratic Equations, Introduction to Probability and Statistics; Congruent Triangle, Applying Congruent Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Similarity, Circles, Polygons and Areas, Surface Area and Volume.  10th Grade  In the 10th grade, all students are required to take the course "Algebra and Trigonometry." The goal of this course is to continue developing student competence to deal with mathematical expressions. The course develops fluency in algebraic manipulations, especially with rational and radical expressions, and in solving quadratic equations. Students are placed in either an elementary, intermediate or honors level class based on the results of a placement test. The course includes the following topics: Equations and Inequalities, Systems of Equations and Problem Solving, Polynomials and Polynomial Equations, Equations of Second Degree, Rational Expressions and Equations, Polynomial Functions, Powers, Roots, and Complex Numbers, Quadratic Equations, Relations, Functions and Graphs, Quadratic Functions and Transformations, Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Trigonometric Functions, Trigonometric Identities and Equations, Counting and Probability.  11th Grade  In the 11th grade, all students are required to take the course "Pre-calculus." The goal of this course is to develop student competence in logical and abstract thinking. Building on the competence developed in previous courses, 11th grade students fully utilize their ability to understand mathematically-expressed abstract concepts and to express their own ideas mathematically. This training logical and abstract thinking will be extremely valuable throughout their lives. Students are placed either in an elementary, intermediate, or honors level class, based on their Algebra and Trigonometry course grades. The course includes the following topics: Trigonometric Functions, Introduction to Three dimensional Geometry, Vector Algebra, Permutations and Combinations, Binomial Theorem, Probability, Straight Lines, Conic Sections, Matrices, Determinants, Sequence and Series, Mathematical Induction, Three Dimensional Geometry.  The mathematics core curriculum is structured on mathematical content areas. To develop students' problem solving ability of utilizing knowledge of various mathematical content areas, 11th graders can elect "Advanced Problem Solving" course. Although the course mainly focuses on mathematical problems, it may include real world social, economical, and environmental problems as well. For students to qualify for the course, they must (1) be in an honor level Algebra and Trigonometry class at the end of the 10th grade and (2) participate in the American Mathematics Competition (AMC-10) during the 10th grade. The course includes the topics as follows: Combinatorics, Complex Numbers, Inversion in Plane, Mathematical Induction, Proofs by Contradiction, Sequence/Series, Basic Probability, Law of Sine/Cosine, Basic Mod Computation, Basic Functions and Graphs, Basic Geometry, Checking the Validity of the Answer, Working Backward, Work with Algebra and Geometry on a Same Problem, Analogy (Find Similar Problem), and Use of Symmetry.  12th Grade  In the 12th grade, all students are required to study calculus, and students who wish to major in science, mathematics, medicine, pharmacy, or engineering at college are required to study linear algebra as well. Students who wish to major in economics and commerce in college are strongly encouraged to take linear algebra. Other students may take linear algebra as an elective course. The goal of these courses is to introduce 12th graders directly to their study of mathematics at Keio University and other colleges in Japan and the United States.  "Calculus for Non-Science Majors" course includes the following topics and students will be placed either in an elementary or intermediate level class by grades of Pre-Calculus: Limits of Functions, Derivatives (The Chain Rule, Implicit Differentiation, Parametric Representation, Differentiation of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Higher Derivatives), Applications of Differentiation (Maxima and Minima, Inflexion Points, Graph Sketching), Indefinite Integrals (Method of Substitution, Integration by Parts, Partial Fractions), Definite Integrals and Applications (Areas and Volumes).  "Advanced Calculus & Linear Algebra for Science Majors" course is a requirement for students applying to faculty of science and technology, faculty of medicine and faculty of Pharmacy. The calculus part in this course deals with single variable calculus and includes the following topics: Limit of Functions, Continuity, Differentiation, Sketching a Graph, Integration including Integration by Parts and Integration by Substitution, Surface area, Volume, Polar Coordinates, Differential Equations and Infinite Sequences and Series. Linear algebra part in this course includes the following topics: Basic Notions of Vector Spaces, Systems of Linear Equations, Determinants, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, Inner Product Spaces up to Orthogonal Projection and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization. The calculus part will be taught in the first three quarters of the school year and the linear algebra part will be taught in the forth quarter. This is a very demanding fast paced course and all the students enrolled in the course are expected to devote a lot of time and effort to study outside of class by reading textbooks and solving problems in the textbooks
__label__0 Math  The College Prep math curriculum focuses on building a strong conceptual base that helps students to become flexible thinkers, able to apply the mathematics they have learned to a rapidly changing world.  Math teachers have designed materials for incremental learning and to address a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Students learn concepts and skills by solving carefully sequenced problems; in class, students often work in cooperative groups. Teachers coordinate courses and review frequently so students retain important ideas from year to year. Instead of separate courses in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, all three areas are addressed in each course of an integrated curriculum. Course materials introduce applications to science and other related fields and provide historical context.  Calculators and computers are important tools of modern mathematics. Teachers instruct students in their appropriate use, but also require a firm grasp of basic skills. Students are required to solve many problems without using calculators. The Math Department uses placement examinations, recommendations, and interviews to ensure that each student enrolls in the most suitable course sequence. Almost all students take four years of mathematics, even though only three are required. Math Club meets regularly to share ideas and investigate problems beyond the scope of the normal curriculum. All interested students are welcome to participate. The club also provides opportunities for students to take part in local and national mathematics competitions.  Math I  Concepts and applications of algebra, problem solving, and geometry are the main topics in this course, designed to prepare students with diverse mathematical backgrounds for Math II. Students learn how to use the scientific calculator to solve problems and use manipulatives extensively to develop spatial visualization skills. They often work together in small groups in the classroom, developing their collaborative skills and their ability to explain mathematics clearly. Students review and practice algebra skills in a wide variety of situations. Topics include proportional reasoning, geometric similarity and transformations, area and perimeter, linear and quadratic equations, and introductory statistics and probability. This course is coordinated with Integrated Laboratory Science.  Math II  This course covers topics from geometry and algebra. The curriculum encourages connections among topics by continually interweaving them. Emphasis is placed on the development of geometric intuition, deductive logic, proof, and a strong foundation in algebra. Group work is encouraged; activities are done in groups, sometimes with physical models and or computers. Class discussions and group activities enrich the learning experience by developing problem-solving and communication skills.  Math III/IIIA  The concept of function serves as a framework for this course. Mathematical modeling (deriving a mathematical expression from real-world data) is introduced, and students do experiments and use graphing calculators to gather information. Students purchase a course-specific graphing calculator and are instructed in its use. Algebraic skills are practiced within the context of solving problems, and geometric interpretations and graphing are emphasized. Students continue the study of linear and quadratic equations begun in Math I and Math II, adding new functions to their repertoire: polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms. This course is offered at two levels: Math IlIA and Math III. Both are college preparatory and cover functions and applications. Math IIIA is accelerated, covering topics usually included in algebra honors, trigonometry and precalculus. It prepares students for Level IIC of the College Board SAT Subject Test in Mathematics. Math III covers topics normally taught in advanced algebra and trigonometry.  Math Analysis & Intro Calculus  This course begins with material from pre-calculus, including a study of functions (polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric) and their graphs. It continues with topics in analytic geometry, linear algebra, vectors and discrete mathematics. The course introduces topics from calculus, such as limits, continuity and derivatives and their applications. Students learn the material through lecture, group work, and homework.  Applied Math  This course explores topics across a broad spectrum, including pre-calculus, calculus, economics, finance, and statistics. The emphasis will be on applications of mathematics to a variety of fields. In the first semester, we will introduce some of the ideas of set theory, statistics (linear regression models), economics (supply, demand) and finance (including simple and compound interest). Second semester, we will continue with more finance (annuities and loan amortization), probability, single variable statistics (normal curve distributions) and calculus (limits, rates of change, derivatives, and integrals). The goal is to expose students to a variety of techniques and applications that will be useful in diverse academic pursuits as well as life in general.  Math V: AP Calculus  This two-semester course covers differential and integral calculus at the college level. There are two versions. Math VAB is the basic course, covering techniques and applications of derivatives and integrals. It prepares students for the "AB" Advanced Placement Examination. Designed for the strongest math students, Math VBC covers the same material, as well as topics like infinite series and multivariable calculus and prepares students for the "BC" Advanced Placement Examination. The department advises students on which course to take based on their previous math work at College Prep. VBC is not recommended for students receiving lower than an A- in Math Analysis and Introduction to Calculus.  AP Statistics  How accurate are opinion polls? Where is the economy really heading? Can you believe the latest "study" about health and diet? The media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is. In Statistics, we look at how data are gathered and presented, and how certain the conclusions drawn from them are likely to be. This means using standard formulas, but we will also look at the math behind the formulas, including probability and its applications. There are lab exercises (sometimes with edible "equipment") and mini-projects in which students design and carry out original investigations. There are also informal discussions of items in the news. This two-semester course is equivalent to a semester of statistics in college and prepares students for the AP exam. It may be taken after or at the same time as Applied Math, or Math Analysis and Introductory Calculus.  The Art of Problem Solving  High school math includes many beautiful topics, but there is so much more math that is accessible to bright and curious high school students like you that we don't include in our curriculum. There just isn't time to do it all. For those of you hungry for more math, The Art of Problem Solving is for you. It is a one-semester math elective which will cover topics in arithmetic, number theory, and counting and probability, as well as some algebra and geometry that isn't already covered in Math I, II, or III/IIIA. Students must have completed Math III/IIIA or equivalent to enroll. You don't have to like math contests to take this course, but if you do like them, this course might help you improve your scores. However, the best reason to take this course is that you will learn new math, and equally importantly, it will be interesting and fun.

__label__0 This book is a first introduction to linear algebra for students majoring in scientific, engineering and social science disciplines. It stresses both practical computation and theoretical principles, and proceeds at a very leisurely pace. One of its characteristic features is that it deals with systems of linear equations at an early stage and uses this theory for the introduction of later techniques and for the proofs of most of the usual vector space theorems. Vector spaces are initially introduced in terms of ${\bbfR}\sp n$, a later chapter gives a more formal treatment. This results in a fair amount of repetition but enables one to choose between a more elementary or more advanced course. The authors have included sections on applications such as difference equations, differential equations, interpolation and least squares approximation, and each chapter includes extensive exercise sections. For the second edition much of the material has been extended and the layout of the text has been improved. There is a new section on linear transformations, and an instructor's manual and a student solutions manual are now available. Reviewer: R.von Randow

It is intended for students who (1) have no exposure to elementary algebra, (2) have previously had an unpleasant experience with elementary algebra, or (3) need to review algebraic concepts and techniques. In F.LE Equal Differences over Equal Intervals 2, students prove the property in general (for equal intervals of any length).  In this task students observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly, quadratically, or (more generally) as a polynomial function.  In this task students have the opportunity to construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).  This lesson is designed for students to gather and analyze data about baseball figures. The student will use the Internet or other resources to collect statistical data on the top five home run hitters for the current season as well as their career home run totals. The students will graph the data and determine if it is linear or non-linear.

__label__0 These classes use a hybrid format. Students are required to come to the Math Lab in the Learning Center at Bakersfield College for Orientation and for all Proctored Assessments. All classes are taught using the Internet-based program, ALEKS. The student may choose to read ALEKS in English or Spanish. The ALEKS website can be found at   Hours/Location:The Math Lab is located in the Learning Center, in the Student Services Building, above the Counseling Offices. A stairway is in the breezeway at either side of the building. Hours are Monday and Thursday, 8:30 am - 5:50 PM and Tuesday and Wednesday, 8:30am–6:50 pm and Fridays, 8:30am–12:20pm. (Summer session: Monday through Thursday, 11am–6:50pm.) THE MATH LAB IS A CLASSROOM. AS A COURTESY TO ALL STUDENTS, CELL PHONES MUST BE TURNED OFF OR SILENCED. NO VISITING WITH OTHER STUDENTS, FOOD, DRINKS (OTHER THAN WATER) OR CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED.  Required Supplies:ALEKS student access code. The access code and workbook may be purchased at the BC bookstore front cash register or the Delano campus after attending orientation. It is also available for purchase online from the ALEKS website.  Course Code:Course Code information for accessing ALEKS is given out during orientation.  Textbook:The ALEKS program is not textbook specific. Any appropriate algebra book may be used in conjunction with the course. Textbooks bundled with the ALEKS program, Prealgebra by Martin-Gay, and Elementary Algebra or Intermediate Algebra by Dugoploski, are available but not required. The Dugoploski texts are available to download by section at no extra charge directly from ALEKS.  Grading:Grading for the class is based solely on results of ProctoredAssessments taken on the ALEKS program. Proctored Assessments may only be taken at the Math Lab at Bakersfield College. Students must present a picture ID. Only the calculator provided by the ALEKS program may be used during the Proctored Assessment. You are required to come in at least four times during the semester to test. If you come in four or more times to test, your highest score will be the score that counts for a grade. If you come in fewer than 4 times to test, we will average your two highest scores to get your grade for the course. The grading scale for all three courses is shown below: Math B50:100-90% = A, 89-80% = B, 79-70% = C, 69-55% = D, 54% and below = F Math B60:100-90% = A, 89-80% = B, 79-70% = C, 69-55% = D, 54% and below = F Math B70:100-90% = A, 89-80% = B, 79-70% = C, 69-55% = D, 54% and below = F  Drop Policy:Each student is expected to put in a minimum of 8 hours each week (11 hrs/week for Summer session) on the ALEKS program. To check your hours, see "Total time on the ALEKS program" under Report. Time on the ALEKS program may be done from any Internet-accessible computer. Student time is checked each Tuesday morning. Excess time one week is credited toward future weeks. Students are required to to put in 4 hours the first week, then 8 hours per week after that. If a student has not done 4 hours in the first week they will be dropped; if they make up the total time during the second week they may request to reinstate. In later weeks if the student is 11 or more hours short on time, the student will be dropped from the course and may request a one-time only reinstatement. If a student becomes 11 or more hours short on time again after being reinstated, he or she will be dropped from the course a second time and will not be reinstated without permission from the instructor.  Tutoring:All students are strongly encouraged to come to the Math Lab to get face-to-face, one-on-one help. We definitely do not expect you to work on the program without the help of an instructor. The Math Lab has faculty and staff ready to help you understand and be successful. You may use the computers in the Math Lab when you need help, or whenever you have some time between classes and would like to work on your ALEKS account. If you find you are having trouble with a topic at home, make a note of the topic or print the page and move on to a different topic. Then come to the Math Lab and let us help you. However, we do not offer help with math problems over the phone or by e-mail. Click "LINKS" at the bottom of this page for online sources for math help.  Incomplete Policy:Students may request an Incomplete grade at the end of the semester in order to complete the class the following semester. A request form for an Incomplete will be available at the Testing Desk in the Math Lab during the last two weeks of class (during summer, last week only).Details on how to qualify for an Incomplete can be found on your syllabus (distributed during orientation). If a student fails to complete the material the following semester, the Incomplete grade automatically becomes an F. If you are receiving Financial Aid based on units, the units for your class count only during the semester you originally enrolled in the class.  Transfer Policy: In order to be allowed to transfer to one of the ALEKS-based hybrid Math courses after the 60% drop date (the last day to drop a semester-length class with a "W"), you must obtain approval from the Mathematics department chair (MS-107E, 395-4331) with a form that can be obtained at the Math Lab.Once approved, the form must be returned to the Math Lab and you must complete an orientation.At that time, you will be provided with a transfer form totake to the Admissions & Records office for completing the transfer process.  Disability Services:Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disabled Student Programs & Services in FACE 16, 395-4334, as soon as possible to better ensure such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.  Academic Dishonesty:Any form of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in a zero for that assignment. This is the only warning you will receive.

__label__0 Science Books  Algebra for Dummies  One of the most commonly asked questions in a mathematics classroom is, "Will I ever use this stuff in real life?" Some teachers can give a good, convincing answer; others hem and haw and stare at the floor.  The real response to the question should be, "Yes, you will, because algebra gives you power" – the power to help your children with their math homework, the power to manage your finances, the power to be successful in your career (especially if you have to manage the company budget).  The list goes on.  Algebra is a system of mathematical symbols and rules that are universally understood, no matter what the spoken language.  Algebra provides a clear, methodical process that can be followed from beginning to end to solve complex problems.  There's no doubt that algebra can be easy to some while extremely challenging to others.  For those of you who are challenged by working with numbers, Algebra For Dummies can provide the help you need.

This is a presentation to remove the 'fear' of Calculus among students and introduce the subject to a anyone who is a total stranger to the subject but not a stranger to Mathematics. The presentation starts with the nature and scope of Calculus and the type of problems solved using Calculus. Mention is also made of the mathematicians who 'invented' the subject. Some interesting curves are also shown in the end.
__label__0 what is pre-algebra?  At least, he's taking the same course I took in 9th grade lo these many years ago. IIRC  Ed seems to remember it all better than I do, and he says the same thing. Christopher is studying the stuff he studied as a freshman in high school.  What is pre-algebra, anyway?  Do we know?  There wasn't any pre-algebra when I was a kid, and I remember Carolyn expressing skepticism about the whole concept back when we first met.  These days I think pre-algebra is simply Year One in a 3-year Algebra Spiral. You teach Algebra 1 in 6th grade, calling it Pre-Algebra; then you teach Algebra 1 again in 7th grade; then you teach it again in 8th.  That's the fast track.  For the slow track you start teaching Algebra 1 in 7th or 8th, calling it Pre-Algebra; then you teach it again for the next two years running.  algebra without the story problems  My other theory is that Pre-Algebra is Algebra 1 without the story problems.  Algebra 1 without the story problems is, IMO, a REALLY bad idea, but that's a subject for another post.  Pre-algebra is simply arithmetic with one new feature: we use letters to represent numbers. Because the letters are simply stand-ins for numbers, arithmetic is carried out exactly as it is with numbers. In particular, the arithmetic properties (commutative, associative, distributive) hold because we are still doing arithmetic with numbers. Thus the identity  3(x + 1) = 3x + 3  holds because we know that it is true when x = 2, when x = 5, and in fact when x is any number at all.  That's it — that's all there is to prealgebra from a purely mathematical standpoint. Later, when students progress to Algebra, this basic idea is used to define functions; as algebra continues it becomes increasingly focused on functions. The purpose of prealgebra is to prepare students for variables and functions without actually mentioning them. It is a crucial topic in the middle grades.  *This is the 'grade A' review for SRA Math, the series Irvington abandoned for TRAILBLAZERS, on mathematicallycorrect. There's a dissenting review by David Klein & Jennifer Marple, (pdf file) also on mathematically correct, saying Saxon is better. Speaking of confusion, I had a memory of mathematicallycorrect reporting that Prentice-Hall Pre-Algebra had been adopted by CA; then a week ago I found a page there saying it had been rejected. Apparently I was right the first time. Was it accepted in one cycle & rejected in another? Don't know.  Algebra is a branch of mathematics which studies structure and quantity. It may be roughly characterized as a generalization and abstraction of arithmetic, in which operations are performed on symbols rather than numbers. It includes elementary algebra, taught to high school students, as well as abstract algebra which covers such structures as groups, rings and fields. Along with geometry and analysis, it is one of the three main branches of mathematics.  So the pre-algebra course overlaps with algebra to the extent that operations are performed on symbols rather than numbers.  I think pre-algebra is just a name that's been stuck on a course regardless of whether it makes perfect logical sense or not.  The LA Times is running a story about the high rate of High School dropouts in the LAUSD.  Below are excerpts from their second article -- on the algebra requirement.  The whole series is avaailable at  but may require site registration.  January 30, 2006 THE VANISHING CLASS A Formula for Failure in L.A. Schools By Duke Helfand, Times Staff Writer  Each morning, when Gabriela Ocampo looked up at the chalkboard in her ninth-grade algebra class, her spirits sank. Gabriela failed that first semester of freshman algebra. She failed again and again — six times in six semesters. And because students in Los Angeles Unified schools must pass algebra to graduate, her hopes for a diploma grew dimmer with each F.  "It triggers dropouts more than any single subject," said Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer. "I think it is a cumulative failure of our ability to teach math adequately in the public school system."  In the fall of 2004, 48,000 ninth-graders took beginning algebra; 44% flunked, nearly twice the failure rate as in English. Seventeen percent finished with Ds.  Among those who repeated the class in the spring, nearly three-quarters flunked again.  The school district could have seen this coming if officials had looked at the huge numbers of high school students failing basic math.  Discouragement, Frustration  Birmingham High in Van Nuys......has a failure rate that's about average for the district. Nearly half the ninth-grade class flunked beginning algebra last year.  In the spring semester alone, more freshmen failed than passed. The tally: 367 Fs and 355 passes, nearly one-third of them Ds.  Like other schools in the nation's second-largest district, Birmingham High deals with failing students by shuttling them back into algebra, often with the same teachers.  Last fall, the school scheduled 17 classes of up to 40 students each for those repeating first-semester algebra.  The strategy has also failed to provide students with what they need most: a review of basic math.  Teachers complain that they have no time for remediation, that the rapid pace mandated by the district leaves behind students like Tina Norwood, 15, who is failing beginning algebra for the third time.  Tina, who says math has mystified her since she first saw fractions in elementary school, spends class time writing in her journal, chatting with friends or snapping pictures of herself with her cellphone.  Her teacher, George Seidel, devoted a class this fall to reviewing equations with a single variable, such as x -- 1 = 36. It's the type of lesson students were supposed to have mastered in fourth grade.  "I got through a year of Vietnam," he said, "so I tell myself every day I can get through 53 minutes of fifth period…. I don't know if I am making a difference with a single kid."  Eager to close this competitive chasm, education and business leaders in California sought to re-engineer the state's approach to math. They produced new math standards they believed would foster a "rising tide of excellence."  This meant teaching algebra earlier, as soon as eighth grade for some students, even if instructors questioned whether younger students could handle abstract concepts. 'I Give Up'  Whether requiring all students to pass algebra is a good idea or not, two things are clear: Schools have not been equipped to teach it, and students have not been equipped to learn it.  Secondary schools have had to rapidly expand algebra classes despite a shortage of credentialed math teachers.  The Center for the Future of Teaching & Learning in Santa Cruz found that more than 40% of eighth-grade algebra teachers in California lack a math credential or are teaching outside their field of expertise; more than 20% of high school math teachers are similarly unprepared.  High school math instructors, meanwhile, face crowded classes of 40 or more students — some of whom do not know their multiplication tables or how to add fractions or convert percentages into decimals.  Birmingham teacher Steve Kofahl said many students don't understand that X can be an abstract variable in an equation and not just a letter of the alphabet.  Birmingham math coach Kathy De Soto said she was surprised to find something else: students who still count on their fingers.  High school teachers blame middle schools for churning out ill-prepared students. The middle schools blame the elementary schools, where teachers are expected to have a command of all subjects but sometimes are shaky in math themselves.  At Cal State Northridge, the largest supplier of new teachers to Los Angeles Unified, 35% of future elementary school instructors earned Ds or Fs in their first college-level math class last year.  Some of these students had already taken remedial classes that reviewed high school algebra and geometry.  "I give up. I'm not good at math," said sophomore Alexa Ganz, 19, who received a D in math last semester even after taking two remedial courses. "I think I've been more confused this semester than helped."  Ganz, who wants to teach third grade, thinks the required math courses are overkill. "I guarantee I won't need to know all this," she said, perhaps not realizing that if she were to teach in a public school, she could be bumped as a newcomer to upper grade levels that demand greater math knowledge.  Administrators in L.A. Unified say they are trying to reverse the alarming failure rates of high school students by changing the way math is taught, starting in elementary schools.  The new approach stresses conceptual lessons rather than rote memorization, a change that some instructors think is wrong. New math coaches also are training teachers and coordinating lesson plans at many schools.  The simplest algebraic concepts are now taught — or are supposed to be taught — beginning in kindergarten.  Searching for a solution in its secondary schools, L.A. Unified is investing millions of dollars in new computer programs that teach pre-algebra, algebra and other skills.  Officials are considering other costly changes, including reducing the size of algebra classes to 25, launching algebra readiness classes for lagging eighth-graders and creating summer programs for students needing a kick-start before middle school or high school. Go figure  Algebra test  A majority of ninth-graders in Los Angeles fail algebra or pass with a D grade.  A copy of the LAUSD pacing plan for "Algebra I: Structure and Method" is included at the end of this letter. It undermines the organization of ideas in this textbook, and it undermines the California Mathematics Framework and Standards. We illustrate with some examples.  The two year pacing plan for "Structure and Method" calls for the quadratic formula together with completing the square of quadratic polynomials (in Chapter 12 of the textbook) to be explained to students before basic factoring techniques for polynomials (in Chapter 5), and before an introduction to radicals, including techniques for simplifying radicals (in Chapter 11). This choice of ordering of topics is so mathematically unsound that it will most likely seriously undermine the ability of LAUSD math teachers to teach algebra in a coherent and meaningful way. It will reduce the learning of algebra to memorizing meaningless formulas without understanding. In the words of the chairman of the Math Department of San Pedro High School (in LAUSD), Richard Wagoner:  "First and foremost among the problems with the Pacing Plan is that it renders the textbook and all support materials useless and obsolete. The sequence is so seemingly random that students must jump back and forth between sections of chapters through most of the course. Therefore, all review materials, diagnostic tests, supplementary materials and enriched materials -- all of which are tied to the sequence as designed by the authors -- can no longer be used."  Teacher George Seidel left a 25-year law career two years ago, hoping to find fulfillment as a teacher at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. "I got through a year of Vietnam," he says, "so I tell myself I can get through 53 minutes of period five.... I don't know if I am making a difference with a single kid."  Officials are considering other costly changes, including reducing the size of algebra classes to 25, launching algebra readiness classes for lagging eighth-graders and creating summer programs for students needing a kick-start before middle school or high school. Go figure  Seems like they're trying everything but what works -- teaching elementary math to mastery before teaching algebraic concepts. It is exeedingly difficult to be this wrong accidentally.  After viewing the photo gallary, I just want to say OMG. This article should be sent to every school board member pushing for "fuzzy" math.  I am a homeschooler, so I don't have a dog in this fight, but ISeeing students in these photos who have been academically-abused for the first 8 years of their school lives just floors me. Really, this country doesn't need to worry about terrorist, we are destroying our country from the inside out.  I look at those pictures and captions and everything points to how grades K-8 failed these kids. Lower schools do not want to hold kids back. One reason given for this is some study showing a higher drop-out rate for those kids who were held back. Duh! Keep passing them right along and you will have a 100% graduation rate.  At our public schools, they use the concepts of developmentally appropriate, full inclusion, and spiraling to justify this approach. They don't want classes/subjects to be filters. However, the filters are delayed until high school so they never see the product of their work. It's easy enough to blame the child, the parent, or society. By eighth grade many kids will decide that they are just not good in math, thereby completely letting the lower schools off the hook. High schools let the lower schools off the hook. They should be yelling and screaming at the lower schools.  My reaction is to tell people to look at the state tests and tell me what is so difficult that schools cannot succeed for most kids no matter what their parents or society does.  I(I'M WRITING COMMENT TO POST AS A KEY WORD SO I CAN FIND THIS AGAIN)  I had no idea homeschoolers didn't struggle over finding a math curriculum.  Of course, I didn't struggle.  There were two choices (that I knew of at the time), and I made the choice quickly once I saw both.  Here are all these teachers AND students saying 'He still counts on his fingers' — how can anyone NOT take seriously the absolute need to learn the procedures and algorithms of elementary math COLD.  My kindergarten aged son gets embarrassed when he has to resort to counting on his fingers to solve an addition or subtraction problem. You think these kids don't know that thye're not supposed to be counting on their fingers in high school? I'm sure this is all part of the low self-esteem problem you get when you you can't do math.  When you're working efficiently at your child's pace, rather than at the pace of the class & the school with its many holidays & moments of lost instructional time, I think it would be easy to get through one Saxon book & two Singapore books each school year K-5 or even K-8.  Because these kids - these young adults - really are suffering. You can see it in their body language.  This didn't need to happen aren know.  Because we are looking at pain.  These young people break my heart.  Every one of these young people can solve an equation like  3x + 2 = 32  Christopher may be able to do that now.  IF CHRISTOPHER WERE USING SAXON MATH HE'D BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH EASE.  The only reason Christopher has found equations like this one hard is that the course moves way too fast with way too little practice.  I suppose the crafty teacher could secretly teach elementary math in class instead of algebra. It's not like these kids are in any condition to pass algebra anyway. Of course, thne this teacher looks bad since his students are all failing algebra and some other teacher will get all the glory when they ultimately pass algebra arenBut what is it? ................  My MIL taught math to middle school kids for 25 years. She.  She  "Most students who enter my eighth-grade Algebra I or Honors Algebra I classes in September each year are ill-prepared to learn algebra because most of them have not fully mastered arithmetic. To make matters worse, I have too few class periods to teach them the entire rigorous course when one adds up the drug education activities, annual class trips, report card day, vacations, snow days, exams, and parent-teacher conferences. These restrictions demand that the students put in extensive quality time outside of class grappling with difficult problems and practicing for accuracy.  They really should only count full days with the teacher when they're adding up the 180 days of school required. It would probably shock parents how few days in the year are actually spent with their teacher learning about core subjects.  "It would probably shock parents how few days in the year are actually spent with their teacher learning about core subjects."  Even with the teacher instructional time is a shrinking commodity. The first activity of the day is handing out meal ticket. That often takes half an hour of prime time. I've known teachers who schedule an hour of SSR in the morning. More prime time lost. Then you have the dogma of non-instruction under the constructivist regime. Time filled with often trivial activities and projects

__label__0 Mathematics Introduction  Here at Horndean Technology College we understand both the importance and relevance of maths in today's society. Students need to have skills in number, algebra, shape, data handling and problem solving.  All students at Key Stage 3 have 7 lessons of maths per fortnight. We follow a course based on the National Curriculum with most students sitting their Key Stage 3 SATs at the end of Year 9. However, some students are identified as being able to study a more accelerated curriculum and will sit their SATs at the end of Year 8.  At Key Stage 4 students will follow a GCSE course with most sitting their GCSE exam at the end of Year 11. Some, however, will sit their GCSE and the end of Year 10.  The department has 8 classrooms, all equipped with projectors and interactive whiteboards enabling students to benefit from all the latest software. The department also has a dedicated ICT suite allowing students to access the internet, work on the various ICT packages we have purchased and complete any project based work.

__label__0 Solving equations  Once we can solve quadratic equations and simultaneous equations it is tempting to think that we will be able to solve more and more complicated equations by using the same principles but its not always that simple. The quadratic equation:  a x² + b x + c = 0  can be solved using a formula but most polynomial equations don't have formulas to give the solution. Every polynomial with only real or complex coefficients has a complex number solution , this is the fundamental theorem of algebra, but they cannot always be expressed exactly with radicals. To find an approximation to the solution we may have to use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or Laguerre method.  Generalised reciprocity laws are very complicated algorithms that enable you to get crucial information about some of these more complicated equations. In favorable circumstances, they can be used to prove deep statements about the solution sets of algebraic equations.  An equation does not have to be too complicated to lack a formula, for example:  x5 - x + 1 = 0  Numbers  - Real numbers - numbers which are continuous such as when we are representing points along a line - On this site I will sometimes use the term 'Scalar' to mean 'Real' numbers although strictly the term should be used when scaling a vector - In computer programs real numbers have a finite length and may have decimal point and/or exponent this allows us to approximate most real numbers but it is only an approximation.  Set Definition  Function Definition  A function from a set A to a set B is a rule that assigns to each element in A an element of B. If f is the name of the function and a is an element of A then we write f(a) to mean the element of B that is assigned to a. A function f is often written as f: A →B.

Fearless Symmetry - This book approaches symmetry from the point of view of number theory. It may not be for you if you are only interested in the geometrical aspects of symmetry such as rotation groups but if you are interested in subjects like modulo n numbers, Galois theory, Fermats last theorem, to name a few topics the chances are you will find this book interesting. It is written in a friendly style for a general audience but I did not find it dumbed down. I found a lot of new concepts to learn. It certainly gives a flavor of the complexity of the subject and some areas where maths is still being discovered

__label__0 Fourier Series Concept Visualization Tools  Chris Long  For many students the concepts associated with Fourier series can be difficult to comprehend. Two of those concepts are the principle of superposition and the relationship between the time and frequency domains. At Purdue South Bend, Professor Gene Harding and undergraduate student Chris Long worked together using MATLAB to create a pair of visualization tools for illustrating these concepts. Chris did a great job developing these tools, which were used for the first time in ECET207 during the fall 2007 semester. They were subsequently adopted by the main campus and a local community college.  The links for the animations and associated m-files are below. To view them just click on the links.

__label__0 Because of its large command structure and intricate syntax, Mathematica can be difficult to learn. Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed. A Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations. While it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.  "This book is a comprehensive package for knowledge sharing on Mathematics. The language of the book is simple and self-explanatory, this will help the students to grasp the fundamentals of the subject easily. The book follows a to the point approach and lays stress on the understanding of the core concepts. Appropriate number of MCQs are given for each topic that are of great help to the students appearing for competitive and State Board examinations.""   " . . . [a] treasure house of material for students and teachers alike . . . can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic." --London Times Higher Education Supplement "The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking." --SIAM Review "Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards . . . to novelty . . . each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically." --Mathematical Reviews A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling provides in-depth and systematic coverage of the art and science of mathematical modelling. Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.  Most texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables. This approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data. Although the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.  The first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.  Developed from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.  Although the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented. Developed from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.  The field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.  Realizing the specific needs of first-year graduate students, this reference allows readers to grasp and master fundamental concepts in abstract algebra-establishing a clear understanding of basic linear algebra and number, group, and commutative ring theory and progressing to sophisticated discussions on Galois and Sylow theory, the structure of abelian groups, the Jordan canonical form, and linear transformations and their matrix representations.  R is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields. Doing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive. A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.  WILEY-INTERSCIENCE PAPERBACK SERIESFrom the Reviews of History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750"This is a marvelous book . . . Anyone with the slightest interest in the history of statistics, or in understanding how modern ideas have developed, will find this an invaluable resource."--Short Book Reviews of ISI  Because of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code. The book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.

[more inside] posted by no regrets, coyote on Jan 27, 2012 - 7 answers  I have always been horrible at math, but somehow a great programmer.

My prof said he recalls that someone did research and/or created a system in which a student writes a computer program that is pertinent to a certain mathematical concept and upon completion is given the regular math problem (as it would appear in a math class). This enables the student to better understand the math problem, solve, and learn math. Has anyone heard of this or anything similar?

__label__0 Designed for undergraduate students, A Mathematics Companion for Science and Engineering Students provides a valuable reference for a wise variety of topics in pre-calculus mathematics. The presentation is brief and to-the-point, but also precise, accurate and complete.  Learn how to read mathematical discourse, write mathematics appropriately, and think in a way that is conducive to solving mathematical problems. Topics covered include: Logic, sets numbers, sequence, functions, powers and roots, exponentials and logarithms, possibility, matrices, Euclidean geometry, analytic geometry, and the application of mathematics to experimental data. The epilogue introduces advanced topics from calculus and beyond. A large appendix offers 360 problems with fully detailed solutions so students can assess their basic mathematical knowledge and practice their skills.  Here are just some of the questions answered in this book: How can a) Logarithm be converted from one base to another? b) Simultaneous linear equations be solved by hand painlessly? c) Some infinities be bigger then other?
__label__0 Published books of problems generally mean to nudge serious, dedicated and perhaps talented mathematics students towards a research-oriented frame of mind. If you really mean a bound problem collection for general education, I expect you will have to write such a book yourself. But I would probably recommend against publishing such a book - on the grounds: don't teach until you see the whites of their eyes. A mathematics problem that will work with one cohort might variously and unpredictably either defeat or insult the intelligence of another. And, as the the response to your other question might indicate, teachers of mathematics will have very diverse views of what constitute a value partial knowledge of mathematics.  That said, if I had an audience of highly intelligent but not especially mathematically oriented students, I might focus their "last look" at mathematics on Lawvere and Schanuel's Conceptual Mathematics (which has many good problems). The authors show themselves as both wise and smart. While the book could save the soul of a stray mathematician, it does not harbor any hidden agenda that means ignoring the needs of the broader audience. And while it might accidentally remediate some high school induces confusions, even the best trained students will find most of what the authors say both very new and very fundamental.  Serge Lang's Math Talks for Undergraduate also attracts me, but where Lawvere and Schanuel help a student think about the larger world in a more mathematical way, Lang wants non-mathematicians to understand more about what mathematicians do.  Research mathematician/teachers generally hold as a sacred shibboleth the dictum that "mathematics in not a spectator sport." In the case of a class of general education students seeing mathematics in the classroom for the last time, and and the risk of blasphemy, I question this, I question whether having these students primarily trying to solve problems for themselves necessarily constitutes the best use of their time. I believe that the mathematics community has neglected developing of literature of what one might call proof-oriented spectator mathematics. But still I might recommend a book: I taught a course recently out of Ross Honsberger's Episodes in 19th and 20th Century Euclidean Geometry where I focused on close readings of complicated but elementary proofs of concrete and yet often spectacularly counter-intuitive facts, all material most mathematics majors will never see on the grounds that it isn't sufficiently modern. But as a toy model of what mathematicians do it worked very well for my students.
__label__0 Aims and Objectives This course is an introduction to pure mathematics. If you follow the course, you will have a grasp of contemporary mathematical notation, and will become familiar with various methods of proof.  Need Help? You have the following options (in order of preference): 1 think, 2 read the lecture notes, 3 read the book, 4 talk to fellow students, 5 ask the person in charge of your tutorial group, 6 go to a workshop drop-in session, 7 go to a MASH drop-in session, 8 Ask nRich (see below), 9 ask your personal tutor (unless you have one of the odd ones who wants to discuss your life) and if all else fails, 10 make an appointment with me by e-mail.  The best bulletin board that supports undergraduate mathematicians is nRich. You register at that site, and then click on the Ask nRich link. There are bulletin boards at various levels. The one appropriate to undergraduates is Higher Dimension. You may find some early undergraduate topics being discussed in Onwards and Upwards. The latter is really for people aged 16-18, but smart school students often discuss university mathematics.  Discussions worth reading Over at Cambridge, Tim Gowers is introducing a new feature this year, his Weblog. While it will be tailored to his first year lectures at his university, I expect we will all learn a thing or two from Tim. There are Terry Tao's maths quizzes, which seem to be very attractive aids to learning pure maths in general (not just for this course). Both Terry and Tim have Fields Medals (these are like Nobel prizes, but for clever people).  Timetable Here is the course timetable. For this course, Lectures (and Problem Classes) are at Tuesday 9:15 University Hall, Thursday 16:15 University Hall and Friday 12:15 (Problem Class) University Hall.  The Mathematics Department has set up drop-in Workshops to advise students on this course (and others). These are 14:15 -- 16:05 Monday 1W4.40, 10:15 -- 12:05 Tuesday 1W4.40 and 17:15 -- 19:05 1W4.40. You can drop in to any of them for as long, or as short, as you wish. The workshops will not run in Week 1 but our Algebra 1A tutorials will run in week 1. There are also drop-in help sessions organized by MASH. These are on Tuesday 14:15 -- 16:05 in 1W2.5, Wednesday 13:15 -- 15:05 in 1W3.15 and Thursday 13:15 -- 15:05 in 4W1.7. Please let me know if any of this information is broken.  Feedback The best way to get feedback on your progress is via your tutor. Hand-in work by the specified time and date in the relevant 4W level 1 slot. Your tutor will comment on your work, which should be returned to you about a week later. It is a crime to go to a tutorial without having tried the problems on the current sheet. It is also a crime to go to a tutorial without knowing the meaning of every word used on the problem sheet (since if you do not understand the words, you will not understand the questions). It is most definitely not a crime to be stuck, confused or bamboozled, and your tutor should be able to help you there. Do not ask your tutor to show you how to do the problems. Rather your tutor should help you understand the problems with sufficient insight that you can do some of the problems yourself. Problems come in varying levels of difficulty, and it would be an extraordinary student who could regularly do them all. What do you do if you think I have made an error in lectures, on a question sheet or on a solution sheet? Well, first check if someone else agrees with you. Then if so, send me an e-mail with the relevant information.  Lecturer's Lecture Notes These are in my head, and therefore cannot be borrowed. If you miss a lecture or lectures, then borrow a set of notes from a reliable scribe, and copy them up by hand or photocopying machine.  Problem Sheet Solutions Written solutions will be put up at this site after the work has been handed in.  Lecture 1Boole's rules are here. Problem Sheet 1. In this lecture we made three definitions and introduced some notation. We defined the notion of a set, and wrote x ∈ A to mean that x is an element of the set A. We defined the notion of a subset, and wrote A ⊆ B. We decided to write A = B when both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A. It follows that there is a unique set with no elements, so we can apply the definite article to the empty set ø. The set of natural numbers is ℕ, the set of integers is ℤ, the set of rational numbers is ℚ, the set of real numbers is ℝ and the set of complex numbers is ℂ. We introduced interval notation (a,b), [a,b], (a, b] and [a,b]. Thus, for example, (1,2) = { x | x ∈ ℝ, 1 < x, x < 2}. Finally I asked if there was a collection of open intervals with the property that the intersection of each pair is not the empty set, but the intersection of the whole collection is the empty set. Incidentally, I spent last Sunday marking the 2012 UK Mathematical Olympiad for Girls.  Lecture 2 We introduced more notation, including that for intersection and union. We discussed Boole's rules at some length, including De Morgan's laws. We began to discuss maps. A dark warning was issued against allowing the set of all sets to be a set, for Bertrand Russell is waiting for the unwary, and will hit you with a paradox if you do that. Note the quality of the moustache.  Lecture 3 We introduced the identity map on a set, and constant maps. We defined composition of maps, and showed that composition of maps, where defined, is an associative process. We defined injective, surjective and bijective maps. We proved that each of these last three types of map is closed under map composition (Proposition 10). Here is Problem Sheet 2, due in on Monday October 17.  Here are Solutions to sheet 1. Note the use of the "maps to" symbol, a right arrow with a short vertical tail. This is used to describe how a map acts. Thus f: x |-> x^2 means the same as f(x) = x^2. Sorry about the home made symbols, I am still looking for the way to display the "maps to" symbol in html. This is not the same symbol as the right arrow which sits between the domain and codomain of a map.  Lecture 4 We characterized injections, surjections and bijections between non-empty sets in terms of the existence of left, respectively right, respectively (unique) two sided inverses. We introduced the notion of the power set of a set. We showed that if A is a finite set, then |P(A)| = 2n. We began the proof that for any set B, there is no bijection between B and P(B).  Lecture 5. We finished the proof mentioned above. We proved that there is a bijection between the natural numbers and the integers. We proved that if S is an infinite subset of the natural numbers, then there is a bijection between S and the natural numbers. We proved that there is a bijection between the set of ordered pairs of natural numbers and the natural numbers. We stated (but will not prove) that if A and B are sets, then either there is an injection from A to B, or there is an injection from B to A (or possibly both). We also stated, but will not prove in lectures, the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem, that if A and B are sets, and there are injections both from A to B, and from B to A, then there is a bijection between A and B. Problem Sheet 3 and Sheet 2 Solutions.  Lecture 6 We defined countability: a set S is countable if (and only if) there is an injection f : S → ℕ We proved that the set ℚ of rational numbers is (infinite) countable. We used Cantor's diagonal argument to show that the real interval [0,1/2] is not countable, and so ℝ is not countable. Note that there was a typo (chalko?) in the diagonal argument. At one point I wrote yi when I should have written yii.  Lecture 7 Here are notes v2 on partitions and equivalence relations. here are the changes to version 1 in case you have it. First line, R is a subset of S X S, not R is a subset of S. In "Properties of Relations", the erroneous spelling reflextive was eliminated. In Examples of Partitions (iii), change "for" to "form". In Examples of Equivalence Relations (ii), insert the missing comma after the word "sets". In the discussion after teh Examples of Transversals, correct the mangled spelling of "equivalence". In teh final part on scary notation, change [3] to [2].  At the Problems Class on Friday October 19 2012, a student called Miles proposed a better solution to Sheet 2, problem 8(d), than the one which I had suggested in the solutions sheet.  Lecture 8 We started number theory. We defined prime numbers, and proved that there are infinitely many of them. We defined coprimality, and we showed that if m and n are integers and not both 0, then the smallest positive integer g expressible as rm + sn (with integers r and s) is the greatest common divisor of m and n, and moreover that every common divisor of m and n will divide g. We stated the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that every positive integer greater than 1 is the product of prime numbers in a (more or less) unique way. We got as far as proving the existence of such a factorization, and will address uniqueness in the lecture on Thursday. This note addresses the chalko in Euclid's proof, and the matter of good housekeeping (induction) as promised in the lecture. Here are Sheet 3 Solutions.  Lecture 9 We completed the proof of Gauss's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. We discussed how to count the number of divisors of a natural number by looking at its factorization into prime numbers. We compared the prime factorization of positive integers m and n with their prime factorizations. We discussed Euclid's algorithm, why it terminates, and why it gives the gcd of two positive integers as the output. Here is a question which has a nice answer: "what is the sum of the divisors of 1000?". You can do it in your head (provided that you are relaxed about multiplying a three-digit number by a two-digit number, and who isn't?).  Lecture 10 We endowed the integers mod n with well-defined addition and multiplication. We defined the notion of a group, and gave several examples. Here are some notes which will assist you with Sheet 5, Questions 1 and 2 in particular, and life in general.  Thu Nov 8 Lecture 13 We introduced Euler's φ-function, and proved that it was multiplicative with respect to coprime arguments (by exploiting the Chinese Remainder Theorem). We also proved that of f, g are polynomials in K[X] where K is a field, and g is not the zero polynomial, then there are q, r in K[X] such that f = qg + r and deg r < deg g. There were a couple of glitches. (i) In the proof that deg(f + g) ≤ max {deg f, deg g}, I wrote (al + bl)Xk+l but the exponent should be l rather than k + l. (ii) Also in the calculation of φ(pk), the set being subtracted should have been { tp | 0 ≤ t < pk-1} (and not { tp | 0 ≤ t < p}).  Tue Nov 20 Lecture 16 More on linear maps and matrices. Small glitch in one proof. Fix to follow. How to invert a 2 by 2 real matrix (or indeed, any 2 by 2 matrix with entries in a field). There was a glitch in the lecture, in (iii) where we were establishing that if the determinant of a real 2 by 2 matrix is 0, then it has no inverse. Here is a fix. Here is Problem Sheet 9Sheet 8 solutions.  Thu Nov 22 Lecture 17 The area/volume interpretation of determinants for 2 by 2 and 3 by 3 matrices with real entries.  Thu Dec 6 Lecture 20 Each element of S_n is either an even permutation or an odd permutation, and no permutation is in both categories. Therefore S_n is the union of two cosets of A_n, and A_n has size n!/2. Sheet 10 solutions. Vacation Problem Sheet 11.  Tue Dec 11 Lecture 21 The use of the sign of a permutation to define a determinant of a square matrix as an alternating sum of monomials.  The email address G.C.Smith@bath.ac.uk is the official University of Bath format, though once upon a time the shiny new format was masgcs@bath.ac.uk -- the one that people actually use is, of course, entirely different: gcs@maths.bath.ac.uk -- as far as I know, all these incantations work.
__label__0 Discrete Mathematics With Combinatorics  9780130457912  ISBN:  0130457914  Edition: 2 Pub Date: 2003 Publisher: Prentice Hall PTR  Summary: As in the first edition, the purpose of this book is to present an extensive range and depth of topics in discrete mathematics and also work in a theme on how to do proofs. Proofs are introduced in the first chapter and continue throughout the book. Most students taking discrete mathematics are mathematics and computer science majors. Although the necessity of learning to do proofs is obvious for mathematics majors, ...it is also critical for computer science students to think logically. Essentially, a logical bug-free computer program is equivalent to a logical proof. Also, it is assumed in this book that it is easier to use (or at least not misuse) an application if one understands why it works. With few exceptions, the book is self-contained. Concepts are developed mathematically before they are seen in an applied context. Additions and alterations in the second edition: More coverage of proofs, especially in Chapter 1. Added computer science applications, such as a greedy algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph, a recursive algorithm for counting the number of nodes on a binary search tree, or an efficient algorithm for computinga b modnfor very large values ofa, b,andn. An extensive increase in the number of problems in the first eight chapters. More problems are included that involve proofs. Additional material is included on matrices. Inclusion of finite states with output and Turing machines. True-False questions at the end of each chapter. Summary questions at the end of each chapter. A glossary at the end of each chapter. Functions and sequences are introduced earlier (in Chapter 2). Calculus is not required for any of the material in this book. College algebra is adequate for the basic chapters. However, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than do the basic chapters, so calculus is recommended more for giving maturity, than for any direct uses. This book is intended for either a one- or two-term course in discrete mathematics. The first eight chapters of this book provide a foundation in discrete mathematics and would be appropriate for a first-level course for freshmen or sophomores. These chapters are essentially independent, so that the instructor can pick the material he/she wishes to cover. The remainder of the book contains appropriate material for a second course in discrete mathematics. These chapters expand concepts introduced earlier and introduce numerous advanced topics. Topics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings. The range of topics include: Logic--Including truth tables, propositional logic, predicate calculus, circuits, induction, and proofs. Set Theory--Including cardinality of sets, relations, partially ordered sets, congruence relations, graphs, directed graphs, and functions. Algorithms--Including complexity of algorithms, search and sort algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm, Huffman's algorithm, Prim's algorithms, Warshall's algorithm, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithms. Graph Theory--Including directed graphs, Euler cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles and paths, planar graphs, and weighted graphs. Trees--including binary search trees, weighted trees, tree transversal, Huffman's codes, and spanning trees. Combinatorics--including permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion, partitions, generating functions, Catalan numbers, Sterling numbers, Rook Polynomials, derangements, and enumeration of colors. Algebra--Including semigroups, groups, lattices, semilattices, Boolean algebras, rings, fields, integral domains,[
__label__0 Determinants  In this lesson on Determinants, you will learn the basics of a determinant such as the requirement of square matrices and using vertical bars to differentiate them from standard matrices. You will then move onto finding the second order determinant of a 2x2 matrix before moving into finding the third order determinant of a 3x3 matrix. For a 3x3 matrix you first learn the technique called expansion by minors before moving into the diagonal method. Four examples at the end test your new found knowledge.  This content requires Javascript to be available and enabled in your browser.  Determinants  Third-order determinants can be evaluated by expanding by minors along any row or column of the associated matrix.  These determinants can also be found by calculating products of entries along the diagonals and then adding and subtracting these products.  Determinants  Lecture Slides are screen-captured images of important points in the lecture. Students can download and print out these lecture slide images to do practice problems as well as take notes while watching the lecture.
__label__0 Just because something doesn't teach everything about a subject doesn't make it a poor instructional aid. Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it. Even if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all. (Though if you end up struggling with the harder topics because you didn't have the rules of algebra appropriately memorized, you might never want to study more of it...)  Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it.  I disagree. I think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with. After all, his goal is to balance an equation, and look, he just balanced it... so what else is there to know ? Thus, the memorization approach creates the impression that math (or whatever subject you're studying) is all about arbitrary rules that make no sense; it's all about "guessing the teacher's password", and that's boring.  Contrast this with the approach of treating an equation like a puzzle. If "2x - 3 = 5", and we want to know what x is, there are many ways to approach the solution. We could ask, "someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?", or we could say, "the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?", etc. Some possible partial answers are, "someone took away 3, so let's add it back", or "if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution". But "add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise" isn't much of an answer. High scores don't mean anything, algebra does.  Well, I can't speak for others, but my personal experience with math tends to be that I only start properly learning why something works once I have the rules pretty well memorized. Before that, my working memory is so occupied with trying to just remember how to apply the rules that I don't have the space to remember why they work. Or alternatively, I can learn why the rules work - but in that case I don't have the memory capacity left for remembering how to apply them.  Of course, this is complicated by the fact that during the process of trying to memorize the rules, I often stop to think about why they work in an attempt to rederive them and make sure I'm not misremembering them. So it's not pure rote memorization, like the way it seems to be with DragonBox. But I would still expect that if somebody first learned them as meaningless rules in the game, and was then later taught math and the reasons for the rules, they'd have a good chance of being delighted at discovering where the rules came from, and could spend all of their cognitive capacity on developing an actual understanding.  Fair enough; it's possible that you and I simply think in different ways. I personally find it very difficult to memorize (seemingly) arbitrary rules, and I found it very difficult to un-teach the "guess the teacher's password" mentality to people. But it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.
__label__0 Find a LonetreeSystems of equations and inequalities are examined both graphically and algebraically. This course also touches on complex numbers and DeMoivre's theorem as well as sequences, induction, counting, and probability. As a PhD student, I spent many hours reading complex books and articles and I am confident that I can help your student achieve higher reading comprehension levels
__label__0 Matrices  Summary: This chapter covers principles of matrices. After completing this chapter students should be able to: complete matrix operations; solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan method; Solve linear systems using the matrix inverse method and complete application problems.  Chapter Overview  In this chapter, you will learn to:  Do matrix operations.  Solve linear systems using the Gauss-Jordan method.  Solve linear systems using the matrix inverse method.  Do application problems.  Introduction to Matrices  Section Overview  In this section you will learn to:  Add and subtract matrices.  Multiply a matrix by a scalar.  Multiply two matrices.  A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices are useful in organizing and manipulating large amounts of data. In order to get some idea of what matrices are all about, we will look at the following example.  Example 1  Problem 1  Fine Furniture Company makes chairs and tables at its San Jose, Hayward, and Oakland factories. The total production, in hundreds, from the three factories for the years 1994 and 1995 is listed in the table below.  Table 1  1994  1995  Chairs  Tables  Chairs  Tables  San Jose  30  18  36  20  Hayward  20  12  24  18  Oakland  16  10  20  12  Represent the production for the years 1994 and 1995 as the matrices A and B.  Find the difference in sales between the years 1994 and 1995.  The company predicts that in the year 2000 the production at these factories will double that of the year 1994. What will the production be for the year 2000?  Before we go any further, we need to familiarize ourselves with some terms that are associated with matrices. The numbers in a matrix are called the entries or the elements of a matrix. Whenever we talk about a matrix, we need to know the size or the dimension of the matrix. The dimension of a matrix is the number of rows and columns it has. When we say a matrix is a 3 by 4 matrix, we are saying that it has 3 rows and 4 columns. The rows are always mentioned first and the columns second. This means that a 3×43×4 size 12{3 times 4} {} matrix does not have the same dimension as a 4×34×3 size 12{4 times 3} {} matrix. A matrix that has the same number of rows as columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with all entries zero is called a zero matrix. A square matrix with 1's along the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else, is called an identity matrix. When a square matrix is multiplied by an identity matrix of same size, the matrix remains the same. A matrix with only one row is called a row matrix or a row vector, and a matrix with only one column is called a column matrix or a column vector. Two matrices are equal if they have the same size and the corresponding entries are equal.  Matrix Addition and Subtraction  If two matrices have the same size, they can be added or subtracted. The operations are performed on corresponding entries.  To multiply a matrix by another is not as easy as the addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication of matrices. Because of its wide use in application problems, it is important that we learn it well. Therefore, we will try to learn the process in a step by step manner. We first begin by finding a product of a row matrix and a column matrix.  Solution  We already know how to multiply a row matrix by a column matrix. To find the product ABAB size 12{ ital "AB"} {}, in this example, we will be multiplying the row matrix AA size 12{A} {} to both the first and second columns of matrix BB size 12{B} {}, resulting in a 1×21×2 size 12{1 times 2} {} matrix.  We have just multiplied a 1×31×3 size 12{1 times 3} {} matrix by a matrix whose size is 3×23×2 size 12{3 times 2} {}. So unlike addition and subtraction, it is possible to multiply two matrices with different dimensions as long as the number of entries in the rows of the first matrix are the same as the number of entries in columns of the second matrix.  Solution  This time we are multiplying two rows of the matrix AA size 12{A} {} with two columns of the matrix BB size 12{B} {}. Since the number of entries in each row of AA size 12{A} {} are the same as the number of entries in each column of BB size 12{B} {}, the product is possible. We do exactly what we did in Example 6. The only difference is that the matrix AA size 12{A} {} has one more row.  We multiply the first row of the matrix AA size 12{A} {} with the two columns of BB size 12{B} {}, one at a time, and then repeat the process with the second row of AA size 12{A} {}. We get  The product FEFE size 12{ ital "FE"} {} is not possible because the matrix FF size 12{F} {} has two entries in each row, while the matrix EE size 12{E} {} has three entries in each column. In other words, the matrix FF size 12{F} {} has two columns, while the matrix EE size 12{E} {} has three rows.  In order for product ABAB size 12{ ital "AB"} {} to exist, the number of columns of AA size 12{A} {}, must equal the number of rows of BB size 12{B} {}. If matrix AA size 12{A} {} is of dimension m×nm×n size 12{m times n} {} and BB size 12{B} {} of dimension n×pn×p size 12{n times p} {}, the product will have the dimension m×pm×p size 12{m times p} {}. Furthermore, matrix multiplication is not commutative.  In this chapter, we will be using matrices to solve linear systems. In Section 7, we will be asked to express linear systems as the matrix equation AX=BAX=B size 12{ ital "AX"=B} {}, where AA size 12{A} {}, XX size 12{X} {}, and BB size 12{B} {} are matrices. The matrix AA size 12{A} {} is called the coefficient matrix.  Systems of Linear Equations; Gauss-Jordan Method  In this section, we learn to solve systems of linear equations using a process called the Gauss-Jordan method. The process begins by first expressing the system as a matrix, and then reducing it to an equivalent system by simple row operations. The process is continued until the solution is obvious from the matrix. The matrix that represents the system is called the augmented matrix, and the arithmetic manipulation that is used to move from a system to a reduced equivalent system is called a row operation.  Example 12  Problem 1  Write the following system as an augmented matrix.  2x+3y−4z=52x+3y−4z=5 size 12{2x+3y - 4z=5} {}  (30)  3x+4y−5z=−63x+4y−5z=−6 size 12{3x+4y - 5z= - 6} {}  (31)  4x+5y−6z=74x+5y−6z=7 size 12{4x+5y - 6z=7} {}  (32)  Solution  We express the above information in matrix form. Since a system is entirely determined by its coefficient matrix and by its matrix of constant terms, the augmented matrix will include only the coefficient matrix and the constant matrix. So the augmented matrix we get is as follows:  In the Section 2, we expressed the system of equations as AX=BAX=B size 12{ ital "AX"=B} {}, where AA size 12{A} {} represented the coefficient matrix, and BB size 12{B} {} the matrix of constant terms. As an augmented matrix, we write the matrix as A∣BA∣B size 12{ left [A \lline B right ]} {}. It is clear that all of the information is maintained in this matrix form, and only the letters xx size 12{x} {}, yy size 12{y} {} and zz size 12{z} {} are missing. A student may choose to write xx size 12{x} {}, yy size 12{y} {} and zz size 12{z} {} on top of the first three columns to help ease the transition.  Example 13  Problem 1  For the following augmented matrix, write the system of equations it represents.  Once a system is expressed as an augmented matrix, the Gauss-Jordan method reduces the system into a series of equivalent systems by employing the row operations. This row reduction continues until the system is expressed in what is called the reduced row echelon form. The reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix has 1's along the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The solution is readily obtained from this form.  The method is not much different form the algebraic operations we employed in the elimination method in the first chapter. The basic difference is that it is algorithmic in nature, and, therefore, can easily be programmed on a computer.  We will next solve a system of two equations with two unknowns, using the elimination method, and then show that the method is analogous to the Gauss-Jordan method.  Example 14  Problem 1  Solve the following system by the elimination method.  x+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}  (38)  3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y="11"} {}  (39)  Solution  We multiply the first equation by – 3, and add it to the second equation.  Row Operations  One can easily see that these three row operation may make the system look different, but they do not change the solution of the system.  The first row operation states that if any two rows of a system are interchanged, the new system obtained has the same solution as the old one. Let us look at an example in two equations with two unknowns. Consider the system  x+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}  (53)  3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y="11"} {}  (54)  We interchange the rows, and we get,  3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y="11"} {}  (55)  x+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}  (56)  Clearly, this system has the same solution as the one above.  The second operation states that if a row is multiplied by any non-zero constant, the new system obtained has the same solution as the old one. Consider the above system again,  x+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}  (57)  3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y="11"} {}  (58)  We multiply the first row by –3, we get,  -3x-9y=-21-3x-9y=-21  (59)  3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y="11"} {}  (60)  Again, it is obvious that this new system has the same solution as the original.  The third row operation states that any constant multiple of one row added to another preserves the solution. Consider our system,  x+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}  (61)  3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y="11"} {}  (62)  If we multiply the first row by – 3, and add it to the second row, we get,  x+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}  (63)  −5y=−10−5y=−10 size 12{ - 5y= - "10"} {}  (64)  And once again, the same solution is maintained.  Now that we understand how the three row operations work, it is time to introduce the Gauss-Jordan method to solve systems of linear equations.  As mentioned earlier, the Gauss-Jordan method starts out with an augmented matrix, and by a series of row operations ends up with a matrix that is in the reduced row echelon form. A matrix is in the reduced row echelon form if the first nonzero entry in each row is a 1, and the columns containing these 1's have all other entries as zeros. The reduced row echelon form also requires that the leading entry in each row be to the right of the leading entry in the row above it, and the rows containing all zeros be moved down to the bottom.  We state the Gauss-Jordan method as follows.  Gauss-Jordan Method  Write the augmented matrix.  Interchange rows if necessary to obtain a non-zero number in the first row, first column.  Use a row operation to make the entry in the first row, first column, a 1.  Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column one.  Interchange rows if necessary to obtain a nonzero number in the second row, second column. Use a row operation to make this entry 1. Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column two.  Repeat step 5 for row 3, column 3. Continue moving along the main diagonal until you reach the last row, or until the number is zero. The final matrix is called the reduced row-echelon form.  We want a 1 in row one, column one. This can be obtained by dividing the first row by 2, or interchanging the second row with the first. Interchanging the rows is a better choice because that way we avoid fractions.  So far we have made a 1 in the left corner and all other entries zeros in that column. Now we move to the next diagonal entry, row 2, column 2. We need to make this entry(–3) a 1 and make all other entries in this column zeros. To make row 2, column 2 entry a 1, we divide the entire second row by –3.  Before we leave this section, we mention some terms we may need in the fourth chapter. The process of obtaining a 1 in a location, and then making all other entries zeros in that column, is called pivoting. The number that is made a 1 is called the pivot element, and the row that contains the pivot element is called the pivot row. We often multiply the pivot row by a number and add it to another row to obtain a zero in the latter. The row to which a multiple of pivot row is added is called the target row.  Systems of Linear Equations – Special Cases  Section Overview  In this section you will learn to:  Determine the linear systems that have no solution.  Solve the linear systems that have infinitely many solutions.  If we consider the intersection of two lines in a plane, three things can happen.  The lines intersect in exactly one point. This is called an independent system.  The lines are parallel, so they do not intersect. This is called an inconsistent system.  The lines coincide, so they intersect at infinitely many points. This is a dependent system.  The figures below shows all three cases.  Figure 1  Every system of equations has either one solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions.  In the Section 4, we used the Gauss-Jordan method to solve systems that had exactly one solution. In this section, we will determine the systems that have no solution, and solve the systems that have infinitely many solutions.  Example 19  Problem 1  Solve the following system of equations.  x+y=7x+y=7 size 12{x+y=7} {}  (76)  x+y=9x+y=9 size 12{x+y=9} {}  (77)  Solution  Let us use the Gauss-Jordan method to solve this system. The augmented matrix is as follows.  Example 21  Problem 1  Solution  The problem clearly asks for the intersection of two lines that are the same; that is, the lines coincide. This means the lines intersect at an infinite number of points.  A few intersection points are listed as follows: (3, 4), (5, 2), (–1, 8), (–6, 13) etc. However, when a system has an infinite number of solutions, the solution is often expressed in the parametric form. This can be accomplished by assigning an arbitrary constant, tt size 12{t} {}, to one of the variables, and then solving for the remaining variables. Therefore, if we let y=ty=t size 12{y=t} {}, then x=7−tx=7−t size 12{x=7 - t} {}. Or we can say all ordered pairs of the form ( 7−t7−t size 12{7 - t} {}, tt size 12{t} {}) satisfy the given system of equations.  Alternatively, while solving the Gauss-Jordan method, we will get the reduced row-echelon form given below.  The row of all zeros, can simply be discarded in a manner that it never existed. This leaves us with only one equation but two variables. And whenever there are more variables than the equations, the solution must be expressed in terms of an arbitrary constant, as above. That is, x=7−tx=7−t size 12{x=7 - t} {}, y=ty=t size 12{y=t} {}.  Since the last equation dropped out, we are left with two equations and three variables. This means the system has infinite number of solutions. We express those solutions in the parametric form by letting the last variable zz size 12{z} {} equal the parameter tt size 12{t} {}.  The reader should note that particular solutions to the system can be obtained by assigning values to the parameter tt size 12{t} {}. For example, if we let t=2t=2 size 12{t=2} {}, we have the solution (5, –5, 2).  This time the last two equations drop out, and we are left with one equation and three variables. Again, there are infinite number of solutions. But this time the answer must be expressed in terms of two arbitrary constants.  If any row of the reduced row-echelon form of the matrix gives a false statement such as 0 = 1, the system is inconsistent and has no solution.  If the reduced row echelon form has fewer equations than the variables and the system is consistent, then the system has an infinite number of solutions. Remember the rows that contain all zeros are dropped.  If a system has an infinite number of solutions, the solution must be expressed in the parametric form.  The number of arbitrary parameters equals the number of variables minus the number of equations.  Inverse Matrices  Section Overview  In this section you will learn to:  Find the inverse of a matrix, if it exists.  Use inverses to solve linear systems.  In this section, we will learn to find the inverse of a matrix, if it exists. Later, we will use matrix inverses to solve linear systems.  As we look at the two augmented matrices, we notice that the coefficient matrix for both the matrices is the same. Which implies the row operations of the Gauss-Jordan method will also be the same. A great deal of work can be saved if the two right hand columns are grouped together to form one augmented matrix as below.  Now that we know how to find the inverse of a matrix, we will use inverses to solve systems of equations. The method is analogous to solving a simple equation like the one below.  23x=423x=4 size 12{ { {2} over {3} } x=4} {}  (122)  Example 28  Problem 1  Solve the following equation .  23x=423x=4 size 12{ { {2} over {3} } x=4} {}  (123)  Solution  To solve the above equation, we multiply both sides of the equation by the multiplicative inverse of 2323 size 12{ { {2} over {3} } } {} which happens to be 3232 size 12{ { {3} over {2} } } {} . We get  To solve a linear system, we first write the system in the matrix equation AX=BAX=B size 12{ ital "AX"=B} {}, where AA size 12{A} {} is the coefficient matrix, XX size 12{X} {} the matrix of variables, and BB size 12{B} {} the matrix of constant terms. We then multiply both sides of this equation by the multiplicative inverse of the matrix AA size 12{A} {}.  Consider the following example.  Example 29  Problem 1  Solve the following system  3x+y=33x+y=3 size 12{3x+y=3} {}  (126)  5x+2y=45x+2y=4 size 12{5x+2y=4} {}  (127)  Solution  To solve the above equation, first we express the system as  AX=BAX=B size 12{ ital "AX"=B} {}  (128)  where AA size 12{A} {} is the coefficient matrix, and BB size 12{B} {} is the matrix of constant terms. We get  Once again, we remind the reader that not every system of equations can be solved by the matrix inverse method. Although the Gauss-Jordan method works for every situation, the matrix inverse method works only in cases where the inverse of the square matrix exists. In such cases the system has a unique solution.  Application of Matrices in Cryptography  In this section, we see a use of matrices in encoding and decoding secret messages. There are many techniques used, but we will use a method that first converts the secret message into a string of numbers by arbitrarily assigning a number to each letter of the message. Next we convert this string of numbers into a new set of numbers by multiplying the string by a square matrix of our choice that has an inverse. This new set of numbers represents the coded message. To decode the message, we take the string of coded numbers and multiply it by the inverse of the matrix to get the original string of numbers. Finally, by associating the numbers with their corresponding letters, we obtain the original message.  In this section, we will use the correspondence where the letters A to Z correspond to the numbers 1 to 26, as shown below, and a space is represented by the number 27, and all punctuation is ignored.  Example 31  Problem 1  Solution  We divide the letters of the message into groups of two.  AT TA CK –N OW  We assign the numbers to these letters from the above table, and convert each pair of numbers into 2×12×1 size 12{2 times 1} {} matrices. In the case where a single letter is left over on the end, a space is added to make it into a pair.  TO ENCODE A MESSAGE  Convert each group into a string of numbers by assigning a number to each letter of the message. Remember to assign letters to blank spaces.  Convert each group of numbers into column matrices.  Convert these column matrices into a new set of column matrices by multiplying them with a compatible square matrix of your choice that has an inverse. This new set of numbers or matrices represents the coded message.  TO DECODE A MESSAGE  Take the string of coded numbers and multiply it by the inverse of the matrix that was used to encode the message.  Associate the numbers with their corresponding letters.  Applications – Leontief Models  In the 1930's, Wassily Leontief used matrices to model economic systems. His models, often referred to as the input-output models, divide the economy into sectors where each sector produces goods and services not only for itself but also for other sectors. These sectors are dependent on each other and the total input always equals the total output. In 1973, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this field. In this section we look at both the closed and the open models that he developed.  The Closed Model  As an example of the closed model, we look at a very simple economy, where there are only three sectors: food, shelter, and clothing.  Example 36  Problem 1  We assume that in a village there is a farmer, carpenter, and a tailor, who provide the three essential goods: food, shelter, and clothing. Suppose the farmer himself consumes 40% of the food he produces, and gives 40% to the carpenter, and 20% to the tailor. Thirty percent of the carpenter's production is consumed by himself, 40% by the farmer, and 30% by the carpenter. Fifty percent of the tailor's production is used by himself, 30% by the farmer, and 20% by the tailor. Write the matrix that describes this closed model.  This matrix is called the input-output matrix. It is important that we read the matrix correctly. For example the entry A23A23 size 12{A rSub { size 8{"23"} } } {}, the entry in row 2 and column 3, represents the following.  A23=20%A23=20% size 12{A rSub { size 8{"23"} } ="20"%} {} of the tailor's production is used by the carpenter.  A33=50%A33=50% size 12{A rSub { size 8{"33"} } ="50"%} {}of the tailor's production is used by the tailor.  As we said earlier, in this model input must equal output. That is, the amount paid by each equals the amount received by each.  Let us say the farmer gets paid xx size 12{x} {} dollars. Let us now look at the farmer's expenses. The farmer uses up 40% of his own production, that is, of the xx size 12{x} {} dollars he gets paid, he pays himself .40x.40x size 12{ "." "40"x} {} dollars, he pays .40y.40y size 12{ "." "40"y} {} dollars to the carpenter, and .30z.30z size 12{ "." "30"z} {} to the tailor. Since the expenses equal the wages, we get the following equation.  Note:  The use of a calculator in solving these problems is strongly recommended. Although we at De Anza College use TI-85 calculators, any calculator that handles matrices will do.  The Open Model  The open model is more realistic, as it deals with the economy where sectors of the economy not only satisfy each others needs, but they also satisfy some outside demands. In this case, the outside demands are put on by the consumer. But the basic assumption is still the same; that is, whatever is produced is consumed.  Let us again look at a very simple scenario. Suppose the economy consists of three people, the farmer FF size 12{F} {}, the carpenter CC size 12{C} {}, and the tailor TT size 12{T} {}. A part of the farmer's production is used by all three, and the rest is used by the consumer. In the same manner, a part of the carpenter's and the tailor's production is used by all three, and rest is used by the consumer.  Let us assume that whatever the farmer produces, 20% is used by him, 15% by the carpenter, 10% by the tailor, and the consumer uses the other 40 billion dollars worth of the food. Ten percent of the carpenter's production is used by him, 25% by the farmer, 5% by the tailor, and 50 billion dollars worth by the consumer. Fifteen percent of the clothing is used by the tailor, 10% by the farmer, 5% by the carpenter, and the remaining 60 billion dollars worth by the consumer. We write the internal consumption in the following table, and express the demand as the matrix D.  Table 4  FF size 12{F} {} produces  CC size 12{C} {} produces  TT size 12{T} {} produces  FF size 12{F} {} uses  .20  .25  .10  CC size 12{C} {} uses  .15  .10  .05  TT size 12{T} {} uses  .10  .05  .15  The consumer demand for each industry in billions of dollars is given below.  In the closed model, our equation was X=AXX=AX size 12{X = ital "AX"} {}, that is, the total input equals the total output. This time our equation is similar with the exception of the demand by the consumer.  So our equation for the open model should be X=AX+DX=AX+D size 12{X= ital "AX"+D} {}, where DD size 12{D} {} represents the demand matrix. We express it as follows:  We will do one more problem like the one above, except this time we give the amount of internal and external consumption in dollars and ask for the proportion of the amounts consumed by each of the industries. In other words, we ask for the matrix A.  Example 39  Problem 1  Suppose an economy consists of three industries FF size 12{F} {}, CC size 12{C} {}, and TT size 12{T} {}. Again, each of the industries produces for internal consumption among themselves, as well as, the external demand by the consumer. The following table gives information about the use of each industry's production in dollars.  Table 5  FF size 12{F} {}  CC size 12{C} {}  TT size 12{T} {}  Demand  Total  FF size 12{F} {}  40  50  60  100  250  CC size 12{C} {}  30  40  40  110  220  TT size 12{T} {}  20  30  30  120  200  The first row says that of the $250 dollars worth of production by the industry FF size 12{F} {}, $40 is used by FF size 12{F} {}, $50 is used by CC size 12{C} {}, $60 is used by TT size 12{T} {}, and the remainder of $100 is used by the consumer. The other rows are described in a similar manner.  Find the proportion of the amounts consumed by each of the industries. In other words, find the matrix A.  Once again, the total input equals the total output.  Solution  We are being asked to determine the following:  How much of the production of each of the three industries, FF size 12{F} {}, CC size 12{C} {}, and TT size 12{T} {} is required to produce one unit of FF size 12{F} {}? In the same way, how much of the production of each of the three industries, FF size 12{F} {}, CC size 12{C} {}, and TT size 12{T} {} is required to produce one unit of CC size 12{C} {}? And finally, how much of the production of each of the three industries, FF size 12{F} {}, CC size 12{C} {}, and TT size 12{T} {} is required to produce one unit of TT size 12{T} {}?  Since we are looking for proportions, we need to divide the production of each industry by the total production for each industry

__label__0 Mathematics  The mathematics curriculum has two primary objectives. The first is to provide students with a thorough grounding in the structure and techniques of the subject area, so that they will be well prepared for future work at the secondary or college level as well as motivated to challenge themselves in these venues. The second is to provide students with an understanding of the utility and power of the subject area and of their current competence and abilities as well as their potential for future development and comprehension.  Towards these objectives, the Mathematics Department faculty promote critical thinking and problem solving skills that will enable students to find success in applying their knowledge of mathematics to other fields. In addition, the faculty develop the skills necessary for students to effectively utilize technology as a mathematical tool for exploration and analysis. Finally, the faculty nurture an appreciation for mathematics as an exact science and of the role it plays in the fields of physical science, art, philosophy, engineering, architecture, and industry.  Mathematics Curriculum Overview  In order to graduate from Avon Old Farms School, students must complete at least three mathematics courses: Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2 with Trigonometry. Upon completion of Algebra 2 with Trigonometry, students are encouraged to enroll in Advanced Mathematics, Precalculus, or Probability and Statistics. After successfully completing Precalculus, students may elect to take Honors Calculus, Advanced Placement Calculus AB, Advanced Placement Calculus BC, or Advanced Placement Probability and Statistics.  Algebra 1  Algebra 1 introduces the student to fundamental operations using signed numbers and their elementary applications. The goal of Algebra 1 is to develop fluency in working with expressions, equations and variables. Students will extend their experiences with tables, graphs, and learn to solve linear equations, inequalities and systems of linear equations. Students will generate equivalent expressions and begin to apply formulas to methodically solve questions involving motion, speed and distance. Students will simplify polynomials and begin to study and apply strategies to solve quadratic relationships.  Students will use technology to learn, investigate, and develop strategies for analyzing complex situations and mathematical relationships. Topics covered in the course include grouping techniques, exponents, algebraic fractions, linear and quadratic equations, radicals, graphing, inequalities, and the solution of verbal problems.  Algebra 1 Honors  This course is designed for students who have demonstrated a strong ability in previous mathematics courses and who wish to pursue upper-level mathematics courses throughout their academic career. In addition to the topics covered in the regular Algebra 1 course, the honors section studies mathematical modeling, trigonometry, and calculator programming.  Algebra 2 with Trigonometry  This course is a more intensive and extensive study of topics introduced in Algebra 1. The primary objective of the Algebra 2 curriculum is to prepare students for Precalculus or Precalculus Honors. The course is designed to prepare students for college level mathematics and is beneficial for those who will pursue further study in mathematics or related fields. Extensive work is included with equalities, inequalities, absolute value, fractional and negative exponents, radicals, systems of quadratics, logarithms and trigonometric properties. The content of the course is organized around families of functions, including linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, radical and rational functions. Students will learn to represent functions in multiple ways, including verbal descriptions, equations, tables, and graphs. Students will also learn to model real-world situations using functions. To help students prepare for standardized tests, this course provides instruction and practice in a variety of formats. Graphing calculator skills will be taught and used extensively in this course. Throughout this course, students will develop learning strategies, critical thinking skills, and problem solving techniques to prepare for future math courses and college entrance exams.  Algebra 2 with Trigonometry Honors  This course is an extensive, fast-moving study of the fundamental principles of algebra, trigonometry, probability, and statistics to prepare students for Precalculus. Students who earn a high "B" range grade or better in this class usually pursue Honors Precalculus the following year. Topics covered include linear equations, functions, polynomials, complex numbers, quadratic equations, and functions. The honors class will also complete chapters on analytic geometry, exponential functions, trigonometry, sequences, series, and probability. Students completing this class in good standing are prepared to study pre-calculus.  Algebra is the language of calculus. Understanding this, there will be special emphasis early in the year on developing a solid working understanding of the algebraic skills and procedures necessary for success in higher level math courses. Students will learn to define the major concepts in a second year algebra course including polynomials, rational expressions, radical expressions, and complex numbers and then learn how to simplify, add, subtract, multiply and divide these expressions. Other major themes include: solving various types of equations and inequalities, factoring, understanding the concept of a function, and graphing functions on the coordinate plane. Linear and quadratic functions are studied in great detail. Later in the year, students will be introduced to higher degree polynomial functions and associated theorems. Students are introduced to conic sections, exponents and logarithms, right triangle and circular trigonometry, and, if time permits, sequences and series.  Geometry  Geometry's primary objective is the study of Euclidean Geometry as a formal, logical system. Where possible, excursions are made into three-dimensional figures and elementary analytic geometry. Some review of algebraic materials may be included. This course begins with developing visualization and some drawing skills. Both algebraic and geometric models are introduced and are further enhanced throughout the course. Proofs are developed slowly in the first half of the course. Various proof formats, including paragraph, flow-chart, and two-column proofs are presented. Students are expected to be actively involved in their own learning. The use of manipulatives is integrated into this course.  Geometry Honors  The Geometry Honors course begins with a strong development of visualization and drawing skills. Both algebraic and geometric models are introduced and are used throughout the course. Proofs are developed slowly in the first half of the year. Various proof formats, including paragraph, flow chart, and two column proofs, are presented. Students are expected to be actively involved in their own learning. Manipulatives, constructions, and the computer program Geometer's Sketchpad are also integrated into this course.  Advanced Mathematics  This course consists of a more thorough treatment of Trigonometry and other selected topics in Algebra 2 with Trigonometry to prepare students for further study in mathematics. Algebra 2 with Trigonometry is a prerequisite. The primary objective of the Advanced Math curriculum is to prepare students for Precalculus. Integral to the learning process is the systematic review of earlier concepts learned in Algebra 2 with Trigonometry and procedures in which students use previously learned skills to develop proficiency with more advanced concepts. The Advanced Math course includes organizational skills, communication, mathematical tools, calculators, hands on activities and group work.  Precalculus  The primary objective of the Precalculus curriculum is to prepare students for Calculus. Integral to the learning process is the systematic review of earlier concepts learned in Algebra 2 and/or Advanced Math and procedures in which students use previously learned skills to develop proficiency with more advanced concepts, especially Trigonometry. The Precalculus course includes exploration, communication, mathematical tools, manipulatives, calculators, hands on activities and group work.  Precalculus Honors  Designed to prepare the more advanced student for Advanced Placement Calculus, this course provides students an honors level study of trigonometry, advanced functions, analytic geometry, and data analysis. A faster pace also allows for the introduction of topics from calculus earlier in the second semester. Limits, continuity, the definition of the derivative, techniques of differentiation, and applications of the derivative are all explored. Applications and modeling are included throughout the course. Appropriate technology is used regularly for instruction and assessment.  Calculus  This advanced course is an introduction to the fundamental topics comprising calculus. Algebraic, trigonometric, and transcendental functions are studied in the context of differentiation and integration. The Calculus curriculum includes exploration, communication, mathematical tools, manipulatives, calculators, hands on activities and group work. At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to use calculus methods in a variety of applications and problem solving situations.  Calculus Honors  This advanced course is an introduction to the fundamental topics of calculus. Algebraic, trigonometric, and transcendental functions are studied in the context of differentiation and integration. The Honors Calculus curriculum is designed to introduce students to the many application of calculus, learn the fundamental rules of calculus, and develop strong problem solving skills. Students will learn how to use technologies such as the graphing calculator, Mathematica, and Excel to investigate various calculus topics and real world problems. Upon completion of this course, students should be well prepared to move onto a first year college level calculus course.  Probability and Statistics  Less rigorous than Pre-Calculus, the primary objective of Probability and Statistics is to offer students an opportunity to continue their mathematical studies in a new area. This course begins with an overview of statistics and includes an investigation of the fundamental laws of probability. It also includes such topics as distributions, sampling, regression, estimation, and hypothesis testing.  Advanced Placement Calculus AB  This is a rigorous Advanced Placement course designed to prepare students for the AP Calculus AB exam in the spring. The course seeks to develop students' understanding of the concepts of calculus, while providing experience with its methods and applications. A multi-representational approach to calculus is employed with concepts, results, and problems being expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. The connections between these representations are also explored.  Advanced Placement Calculus BC  This is a rigorous Advanced Placement course that prepares students to take the AP Calculus BC exam in the spring. The course seeks to develop advanced problem solving skills by stressing the application of the concepts covered in the problem solving process. The class requires some vacation assignments that are to reinforce the concepts that have been taught. The class moves quickly and covers all the material outlined by the College Board and is intended for students that have had success in Precalculus or lower levels of Calculus and want to challenge themselves at the highest level.  Advanced Placement Statistics  AP Statistics is the high school equivalent of a one semester, introductory college statistics course. In this rigorous course, students develop strategies for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students design, administer, and tabulate results from surveys and experiments. Probability and simulations aid students in constructing models for chance behavior. Sampling distributions provide the logical structure for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Students use a TI-84 graphing calculator, Fathom and Minitab statistical software, and Web-based java applets to investigate statistical concepts. To develop effective statistical communication skills, students are required to prepare frequent written and oral analyses of real data.
__label__0 2.Overview of How Maple enhances the student'slearning in Multivariable Calculus  3.Illustration and practice with major features for Multivariable Calculus through example Maple worksheets for the classroom  4.Student Multivariable Calculus Projects in Maple  Introduction  I have been teaching our second year (Calculus III and IV) for the last 13 of my 27 years at Saint Joseph's College.I first became acquainted with Maple at one of the very early ICTCM conferences.We first adopted Maple V to use in Calculus and other higher level courses.We are using Maple 12 this year and will likely upgrade versions next year.The Calculus III and IV classes meet three times a week.One of those three meetings is in a computer lab.During the other two class times, we are in a regular classroom equipped with a computer with Maple, and projection.  The four primary areas where we have seen advantages in using Maple for our second year calculus are:  Computation:For some concepts, such as tangent and normal vectors, computations can be very cumbersome and thus interfere with conceptual understanding.Maple can remove the drudgery of the computations, allowing students to focus on theory, methods, and applications.  Assignment Verification (Checking Answers):We still want out students to be able to carry out computations(show work!).However,Maple can perform the step by step calculations as well, giving the students a chance to check their work and find their errors.  Independent Exploration and Student Projects:Maple's interface allows students to explore and write about concepts within the same document.They can easily edittheir Maple commands as well as their accompanying writing.Maple 2D math encourages student to write their mathematics with correct mathematical notation.For projects, the interactive style of the software allows students to start by implementing a scaled-back portion of a project idea, then iteratively expand upon that idea.By using Maple's help facilities with instructor's advice and trouble-shooting, students can develop projects that are really fun as well as educational.  At our annual Saint Joseph's College Undergraduate Colloquium, Calculus IV students have been presenting their projects in an informal walk-through "poster session".This format gives them a chance to explain their work to their peers and appreciative faculty in very creative ways.Traditionally they have shown their Maple worksheet interactively along with creative posters or a slide show presentation.They often have a fun activity for the attendees.Some of the memorable activities include:  Maple is a real power tool, which means it requires an investment of time to learn to use its features effectively.Then -- as soon as one starts to feel comfortable – an upgrade is released with new features to master.Some of the helpful resources for keeping up are:

__label__0 Academics Jean-Martin Albert - Mathematics Fellow  Jean-Martin Albert is an enthusiastic teacher with experience teaching math courses and tutoring students, and is well prepared to teach mathematical concepts to students coming from a wide variety of backgrounds. He comes to Marlboro after working in several Canadian provinces, and is looking forward to collaborating with logicians in New England and New York.  Teaching Philosophy  From his experience as a math teacher and teaching assistant for all levels of undergraduate courses, Jean-Martin has learned that many students, especially in introductory courses, are intimidated by mathematics, and view the material as abstract and tedious. He says, "I try to show them that mathematics can be fun and useful, and most often, especially at the introductory level, not very far removed from reality. My enthusiasm plays a big part in the process."  Jean-Martin believes that "the best way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics, and a big part of doing mathematics is solving problems. I try to show the students that each formula and each theorem is the answer to a particular question, whether the question came from the real world or is mathematics for its own sake." He also notes that discussion and teamwork are an important part of learning mathematics. "Each student will see a problem in a slightly different light, and so each will consider a different approach to the solution." He then asks students to try to explain to him or to other students how they arrive at a solution, in order to help them internalize and remember the solution they found. He also encourages mistakes: "I want the students to fall into traps, make mistakes, and learn to see exactly where they made the mistake, and how to recover from it."  Scholarly Activities  Jean-Martin is interested in mathematical logic, more specifically continuous model theory and its applications to functional analysis. This is a new and exciting area of mathematical logic, which has applications to many other mathematical areas such as algebra, topology, functional analysis, p-adic analysis and probability.

__label__0 Description: This course studies fundamental algebraic systems in mathematics, selected from groups, rings, fields, and modules. Examples of groups include the invertible matrices with a fixed size and the roots of unity. Rings are illustrated by integers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.) Finally, ordinary vectors in space and any lattice in the plane are examples of modules. The concern with these algebraic systems is not simply the study of individual systems, but also of functions between systems which carry one operation into the other. For instance, the determinant not only converts matrices into numbers, but it sends a product of matrices into a product of numbers. The level of attention given to such operation-preserving transformations (putting them on an equal footing with the algebraic systems they transform) is one of the characteristic features of abstract algebra, and also one of the algebraic ideas which have reached into other areas of mathematics. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in MATH 2142(244) or 2710(213). Recommended preparation: MATH 2210Q(227Q) or 2144Q(246Q). Offered: Fall Credits: 3  These are the most recent data in the math department database for Math 216 in Storrs Campus.

__label__0 Core Abilities (Note: since this course may be taken in partial fulfillment of the general education requirements, this syllabus includes the following set of core ability goals.)  1. Thinking: Students engage in the process of inquiry and problem solving that involves both critical and creative thinking.  Students will be exposed to the logic of mathematical proof  Students will develop their problem-solving skills  Calculus is a major intellectual development in human history and students will think through the concepts  2. Communication: Students communicate orally and in writing in an appropriate manner both personally and professionally.  Students will develop their skills of written mathematical communication, specifically learning to properly use the language and notation of the Calculus  Students will develop their verbal mathematical communication skills, both in small groups and in class discussions  3. Life Values: Students analyze, evaluate and respond to ethical issues from informed personal, professional, and social value systems.  Students will see the importance of integrity regarding their own scholarship  4. Community Involvement: Students demonstrate skills of interdependent group participation and decision-making.  Students will work in groups, learning to share their ideas and skills, and respecting the ideas and skills of others  Specific Course Goals:  1. From the perspective of mathematical content, this course should allow the student to expand and apply skills and knowledge gained in the first semester of Calculus to the topics of integration and applications of integration.  2. The student will gain knowledge and skills, and the ability to apply these, to a variety of situations which might be encountered in the world of mathematics, science, or engineering.  3. The student will further improve his/her ability to communicate mathematical ideas and solutions to problems.  4. The student will improve her/his problem-solving ability.  5. From a most general perspective, the student should see growth in his/her mathematical maturity. The three-semester sequence of calculus courses form the foundation of any serious study of mathematics or other mathematically-oriented disciplines.  Course Philosophy and Procedures:  I am a firm believer in the notion that you as the student must be actively engaged in the learning process and that this is best accomplished by your DOING mathematics. My job here is not to somehow convince you that I know how to do the mathematics included in the course, but to help guide YOU through the material; I am to be a "guide on the side, NOT a sage on the stage". I may not always say things in the way which best leads to your full comprehension, but I will try to do so and I ask that you try to see your learning as something YOU DO rather than as something I do to you. PLEASE feel free to come see me to discuss questions or concerns you may have during the course; I will not bite! PLEASE ask questions in class if you have them; the only dumb question is the one you fail to ask!  Homework: Let me therefore urge you to make it a regular part of your day to try working the homework problems. There will never be enough time for us to go through every listed problem in class, and it is probably unrealistic to think that you will be able to find the time to work through every listed problem, but you should at least spend some time thinking about virtually every problem, and working the more interesting or challenging to completion. The daily homework assignments will not generally be collected or graded. They are intended to structure your learning so that you regularly challenge yourself to see that you understand the material we are looking at. The important thing is that you at least look at all the assigned problems. You should also feel free to work other problems if you deem it necessary for your comprehension of the content.  You should view homework assignments as a test to see how well you understand the material and you should bring to the next class any questions you might have.  Group Work: In general, I think students can benefit greatly by working together on problems. While there is some danger of the "blind leading the blind" syndrome, or of students deceiving themselves into thinking they understand the material better than they actually do, for the most part grappling with ideas and trying to explain them to another student or learning to listen to others explain an idea is a wonderful way to see that you really do understand the material. In class we will spend an occasional day working on a group "lab", and we sill also typically have a group "practice exam" before the individual exams, and I also encourage you to find a "learning group" outside of class.  Portfolio: I will be asking you to keep a PORTFOLIO of your work. This portfolio will be collected twice during the semester, once upon our return from our spring break, on Monday 17 March, and again at the end of the course, on Friday 2 May. Each of these portfolios should be a representative collection of your work during that half of the semester; each collection you turn in should include 5 problems, written up in a finished form, along with a brief discussion of why you chose to include that particular problem. These problems should represent work you are proud of, or problems which brought you to a breakthrough point. Each of these portfolios of your work will be worth 40 points, 8 points per problem. Presumably you will hand in 5 sheets of paper, each of which will include a nicely organized solution to the problem, which might be from homework, or from a lab or worksheet, of from an exam, along with that reflection mentioned above.  Grading: I use a rather traditional Grading Scale: A = 90% (or better), AB = 87%, B = 80%, BC = 77%, C = 70%, CD = 67%, D = 60%. I do try to come up with a mix of points so that exams are not weighted too heavily; about two-thirds of the points during the semester will come from individual, in-class exams - the rest will come from group labs, take-home problems, group practice exams, journals, and portfolios.  Late Assignments: It is rarely much of a problem at the level of a calculus course, but it remains important that students turn in work in a timely manner, so that they do not get behind. Consequently, Late Assignments will be penalized 20% of the possible points for each class period late, up to a maximum of three periods. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted.  Attendance: I do not prefer to quantify your attendance in terms of a grade, but I can assure you that your chances of success will be much improved by regular attendance.  Americans with Disability Act:  If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services or other accommodations for this class, please see me or Wayne Wojciechowski in MC 320 (796-3085) within 10 days to discuss your accommodation needs.
__label__0 Linear Algebra:Gateway to Mathematics  Description  This text is designed to resolve the conflict between the abstractions of linear algebra and the needs and abilities of the students who may have dealt only briefly with the theoretical aspects of previous mathematics courses. The author recognizes that many students will at first feel uncomfortable, or at least unfamiliar, with the theoretical nature inherent in many of the topics in linear algebra. Numerous discussions of the logical structure of proofs, the need to translate terminology into notation, and suggestions about efficient ways to discover a proof are included. This text combines the many simple and elegant results of elementary linear algebra with some powerful computational techniques to demonstrate that theorectical mathematics need not be difficult, mysterious, or useless. This book is written for the second course in linear algebra (or the first course, if the instructor is receptive to this approach).
__label__0 Organized for use in a lecture-and-computer-lab format, this hands-on book presents the finite element method (FEM) as a tool to find approximate solutions of differential equations, making it a useful resource for students from a variety of disciplines.  The book aims for an appropriate balance among the theory, generality, and practical applications of the FEM. Theoretical details are presented in an informal style appealing to intuition rather than mathematical rigor. To make the concepts clear, all computational details are fully explained and numerous examples are included, showing all calculations. All finite element procedures are implemented in interactive Mathematica notebooks, from which all necessary computations are readily apparent.

__label__0 Graphing calculator?  Graphing calculator?  I need to get a graphing calculator but I am not sure which one suits me best. I need it for graphing and possibly some more advanced functions. I checked out the prices and the TI-89 is somewhat expensive. It seems a little "hyped" than the other older models. Does the TI-85 have everything the 89 has, just on older hardware?  I've owned a TI-83, a TI-84+, and I currently own a TI-89 Titanium, and I must say that the TI-89 T blows the other ones away.  There is much more memory integrated in the calculator, it is much faster. It is also much easier to use the more advanced functions (IMO), and it looks a lot nicer. I would really suggest a TI-89T, you won't be disappointed.  I'm going with Fragment. I own a TI-89 Titanium and it's a very good calculator, has plenty of features (symbolic differentiation and integration, simple ODEs, 2D curve sketching, 3D graphing, simultaneous linear equation solver...), and the learning curve isn't steep at all.  A word of warning, though - don't get addicted to it. If you're still in high school of your first year of college, try to work out stuff by hand. If you keep using your calculator to do simple calculations, you're gonna go rusty fast.  What kind of class do you need this calculator for? For other stuff, I use the European equivalent of this calculator, and it does plenty of stuff (but it doesn't have graphing capabilities), like numerical integration and differentiation, quadratic and cubic equations, up to 3 simultaneous equations, complex numbers, statistical functions, ...
__label__0 Measure and Integration for Use  9780198536086  ISBN:  0198536089  Pub Date: 1985 Publisher: Oxford University Press, Incorporated  Summary: Although of unquestioned power and practical utility, the Lebesgue Theory of measure and integration tends to be avoided by mathematicians, due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed proofs of a few crucial theorems. In this concise and easy-to-read introduction, the author demonstrates that the day-to-day skills gleaned from Legesgue Theory far outweigh the effort needed to master it. This compact account develops ...the theory as it applies to abstract spaces, describes its importance to differential and integral calculus, and shows how the theory can be applied to geometry, harmonic analysis, and probability. Postgraduates in mathematics and science who need integration and measure theory as a working tool, as well as statisticians and other scientists, will find this practical work invaluable.[read more]

Bonus Editorial Feature:  Harold In the Author's Own Words: "I'm a Platonist — a follower of Plato — who believes that one didn't invent these sorts of things, that one discovers them. In a sense, all these mathematical facts are right there waiting to be discovered."  "In our times, geometers are still exploring those new Wonderlands, partly for the sake of their applications to cosmology and other branches of science, but much more for the sheer joy of passing through the looking glass into a land where the familiar lines, planes, triangles, circles, and spheres are seen to behave in strange but precisely determined ways."  "Geometry is perhaps the most elementary of the sciences that enable man, by purely intellectual processes, to make predictions (based on observation) about the physical world. The power of geometry, in the sense of accuracy and utility of these deductions, is impressive, and has been a powerful motivation for the study of logic in geometry."  "Let us revisit Euclid. Let us discover for ourselves a few of the newer results. Perhaps we may be able to recapture some of the wonder and awe that our first contact with geometry aroused." — H. S. M. Coxeter Harold

__label__0 Students, your effort is the single most important factor in determining future success. Math is a skill that is developed through practice. While I can expose you to new ideas and help you perfect your problem solving skills, you must put in practice time. In this course, WebAssign plays a vital role in providing practice with immediate feedback at any hour of the day or night. Forming a study group and working together to discuss and complete assignments is an excellent strategy for success.  You should expect to spend between two and three hours a week on homework assignments. If the assignments are taking longer than that, you need to attend extra help!  You should be able to complete the assignments with at least 80% accuracy. If you are struggling with the assignments, you should attend extra help ASAP. In extra help you will be given an extension, additional tries and help. Please bring your written work with you so we can quickly pinpoint the "difficulty".  If you are thinking, "I'm good at math and I've never had to do homework before" or "Homework is busy work and a waste of time." you are in for a rude awakening.  Parents, look at homework grades on Powerschool. They will let you know if your child is making the required effort. Since homework averages are almost always better than test and quiz averages, homework almost always helps a student's overall average.

The amount of time Lesson Planet will save me is going to be mind blowing!  Title  Resource Type  Views  Grade  Rating  Are your calculus pupils aware that they are standing on the shoulders of giants? This lesson provides a big picture view of the connection between differential and integral calculus and throws in a bit of history, as well. Note: The calculus controversy paper is not included but one can find a number of good resources on the Internet regarding the development of calculus and the role of Newton and Leibnez.  This video covers the differential notation dy/dx and generalizes the rule for finding the derivative of any polynomial. It also extends the notion of the derivatives covered in the Khan Academy videos, �Calculus Derivatives 2� and �Calculus Derivatives 2.5 (HD).� Note: Additional practice using the power rule for differentiating polynomials (including some with negative exponents) is available to the listener.  This video is the 4th in a series of videos that explains derivatives. First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.  This video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.  Continuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions. Note: The current set of practice problems titled �Chain rule 1� cannot be solved until one knows how to find the derivative of ex and trigonometric functions  In the first example, instead of actually using the quotient rule, Sal rewrites the denominator as a negative exponent and uses the product rule. In subsequent examples, Sal shows, but does not prove, the derivative of several interesting functions including ex, ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x.  After defining L�Hopital�s rule, Sal shows an example of using the rule to solve for the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x) / x. He also describes what it means for a fraction to have indeterminate form.  After applying L�Hopitals Rule once and showing that the limit is still indeterminate, Sal applies the rule a second and third time before arriving at a limit that exists. He then shows that given that the final limit exits, so do the previous ones including the limit of the first original problem. Note: Practice problems on L�Hopital�s rule are available and can be practiced now or after watching the other example videos.

__label__0 Determinant  In algebra, a determinant is a function depending on n that associates a scalar, det(A), to every n×n square matrix A. The fundamental geometric meaning of a determinant is as the scale factor for volume when A is regarded as a linear transformation. Determinants are important both in calculus, where they enter the substitution rule for several variables, and in multilinear algebra.  Matrices  In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular table of elements, which may be numbers or, more generally, any abstract quantities that can be added and multiplied.  Matrices are used to describe linear equations, keep track of the coefficients of linear transformations and to record data that depend on multiple parameters.  Matrices are described by the field of matrix theory. Matrices can be added, multiplied, and decomposed in various ways, which also makes them a key concept in the field of linear algebra.  The horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical lines are called columns. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m-by-n matrix (written m × n) and m and n are called its dimensions.

__label__0 Category: Math curriculum in general  Some people will be surprised that our Mathematical Literacy course includes some factoring. Over the years, the topic of factoring has been a focal point of conversations — almost with the assumption that a reform math course would not cover any factoring. Sometimes, we go to the extreme view of "anything not practical right now … will be omitted", and factoring is usually not very practical.  In our Mathematical Literacy course we covered factoring last week — true, this is just the GCF (no trinomial methods nor special formulas). Since we only include GCF as a method students have an easier time. However, if we had time, I would not mind if we covered a little more factoring.  For language skills, it is important that people be able to express thoughts concisely (simplify); in some important situations, it is even more important to be able to express thoughts in a more complex way that maintains the equivalent message — persuasive writing and speaking are particular modes in this style. In a general way, learning (or a process) that can only be used one direction is usually learned only partially. Deeper learning depends upon a variety of experiences with objects or ideas.  Factoring plays a comparable role in any course emphasizing algebraic reasoning. A basic issue in algebraic reasoning is "Adding or multiplying?" Many of our students believe that parentheses always show two things — what to do first (under the curse of PEMDAS) and "this is a product". Our work with the GCF puts students right in the middle of this confusion; in other words, the GCF is a great opportunity for students to better understand basic algebraic notation.  Of course, one risk of this work with the GCF is that students get even more confused. We need to be careful that assessments help students understand better; within the Math Lit class, I need more experience designing the class work so better assessments can be delivered to students.  Of the traditional developmental algebra content, factoring is not my lowest priority — it connects with basic issues of algebra. I can't say the same thing for radical expressions, where we deal with procedures only vaguely connected with exponents. I also place 'rational expressions' lower in priority than factoring; outside of the very basic ideas of reducing simple rational expressions, our time on operations and equations with rational expressions list mostly wasted … the emphasis ends up on procedures, not concepts and understanding. Such topics have been included in developmental courses because they are seen as needed in pre-calculus courses … because they are seen as needed in calculus courses. We should strengthen this flimsy curriculum design based on student needs AND content needs in deliberate ways.  All of us have a role in this process so that mathematics becomes an enabling process rather than a inhibiting process. Factoring polynomials is not necessarily an evil to be avoided.  Join Dev Math Revival on Facebook:  Share this:  The AMATYC conference (Anaheim, October 31 to November 3) will include several sessions on New Life-inspired efforts to reform developmental mathematics. I will be doing a general session on the New Life model at the conference, and other sessions will focus on particular implementations. Over the next month or so, I will be posting a detailed schedule.  This conference will not include a workshop on the New Life courses; this workshop was done at last year's conference and the materials are still available at  If you want to know more about the details of MLCS (Mathematical Literacy for College Students) and AL (Algebraic Literacy), I plan to create some additional 5-minute presentations about each — they will be posted on the "Instant Presentations" page (  Some related work will also be available at the conference — the Dana Center "New Mathways Project" will have sessions. When the mini-program is available, I will post a summary of all reform-related sessions.  Share this:  A course design can facilitate learning, and a course design can hinder learning. I suspect that we get so focused on the details of our math courses that we may not notice whether our course is facilitating or hindering.  In our Math Literacy class, we have been working on algebraic reasoning. On the surface, the class looks like we are not 'covering' very much because we don't include some typical algebraic (developmental) topics. We found some hidden treasure this week in class.  As we often do, part of class is based on groups figuring out problems with some guidance and reflection. Today this meant that we had each group do an equation 'tag-team' style — each student could either do the next step, or erase the last step. Students had a little trouble playing by the rules, and wanted to switch to 'their' method to solve the equation. The payoff came when we talked about the different choices, as more students figured out that they have options for linear equations.  The hidden treasure came next, not that students saw it as totally good. We looked at how we could solve equations of a type never seen before, starting with a simple rational equation (namely, 5 = 200/x). Students could see the solution (40) though not always obtained formally, so we talked about doing 'opposite' operations to solve. We followed this with a radical equation (the pendulum model), which is not normally seen in this level of math course. To solve for the length inside the radical, we listed the calculation steps if we knew the length and wanted to calculate the period. Then, we reversed — the opposite operations in the reverse order.  To me, the hidden treasure in this is that students get to think about both types of skills that we use in mathematics — we have routine procedures (often based on properties) and we have reasoning about statements (often based on relationships unique to the problem). Wouldn't it be wonderful if students developed both strategies, instead of just using routine procedures (often memorized)?  It's clear that my hidden treasure was not perfectly clear to students; after this discussion, we had a worksheet which included an equation of related design. They generally understood the reverse order idea, but thought they should do them in a different order — a choice which requires applying properties of expressions. Our conversation was more satisfying than normal because we had used the reasoning approach, and talked about choices.  Students may still 'want' a recipe for solving equations and simplifying expressions. Giving students a recipe hides the math treasure; emphasizing choices and reasoning allows for the possibility of students finding our hidden treasure.

__label__0 Note: This course serves as a pre-requisite for MATH 110 (College Algebra), MATH 130 (Introductory Statistics), or MATH 155 (Mathematics, A Way of Thinking). You must earn at least a "C" grade to qualify for the next course in your sequence.  ALEKS Student Access Code: Purchased from the Viterbo Bookstore.  You will also need the appropriate Course Code for your specific section, which is provided later in this document.  This textbook is published by McGraw-Hill, who also handles ALEKS for institutions of higher education. Our text has been precisely integrated with ALEKS, so that you can use your book for explanations, worked examples and practice problems as we move our way through the course material.  Course Goals and Student Outcomes:  1. Students will demonstrate their readiness for learning algebra.  (a) Students will take ALEKS assessment.  (b) Students will work through pre-algebra ALEKS modules indicated as necessary.  2. Students will improve their mastery of algebraic skills.  (a) Students will take ALEKS assessment of algebra knowledge and skills.  (b) Students will work through the ALEKS modules indicated as necessary.  (c) Students will take indicated exams to demonstrate their learning.  3. Students will develop their ability to apply algebraic thinking and procedures to problem solving.  (a) Students will work through the ALEKS modules that focus on problem solving.  Course Procedures and Policies:  MATH 001: Math 001, "Introductory Algebra", is a not-for-graduation-credit course intended to prepare students for the various courses for which 001 is a pre-requisite, namely MATH 110 (College Algebra), MATH 130 (Introductory Statistics), and MATH 155 (Mathematics, A Way of Thinking). The material is essentially the first year of algebra, which would typically be taken in high school, which explains why this course is numbered 001, and why the 4 credits you will earn here do not count toward graduation, even though they do count toward full-time status.  Your placement score indicated that you have not mastered this content, whatever the reason. To make the best of the situation, your goal here must be to learn this material and master the necessary skills so that you can be successful in the courses you eventually need to take as part of your college program.  ALEKS: ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces) is a web-based program designed to carefully assess what students know and what they are ready to learn, and then to methodically tutor them in the given material, in this case Introductory Algebra. After registering, you will begin by going through a brief tutorial on the use of the ALEKS input tool, also called the "Answer Editor." On the second day you will do the Initial Assessment in class.  Probably the best thing about ALEKS is that it allows each student to take a course specifically designed for his/her individual needs – students will be working at their own pace and working on material they are ready to learn. The implication of this is that I will not be "lecturing" on textbook sections in the customary way. My role as instructor here is to monitor your learning and to engage in individual tutoring as the need arises.  Another advantage to using ALEKS is that since it is web-based you can work on your course anywhere you have internet access. ALEKS will remember where you left off and will always make sure that you have shown readiness before presenting new material. However, the Initial Assessment and all Quizzes/Exams must be taken during class.  Be sure to do your own work! Your best preparation for online in-class quizzes is when you have been working with ALEKS yourself. By allowing someone else to do your work for you, the only person you are cheating is yourself.  Grading System: Your grade will be determined by the following five factors:  (5) Attendance/ALEKS time outside of class: Important determination for borderline grades  This makes for a total of 560 points. Grades will be assigned according to the scale:  A 93% or above  AB 88 – 92%  B 82 – 87%  BC 77 – 81%  C 70 – 76%  CD 65 – 69%  D 60 – 64%  F < 60%  **NOTE** You also need to complete at least or 80% of the ALEKS topics to pass the course. You need at least a "C" grade to be allowed to advance to the next course in your sequence.  (1) Check-Offs: You will all receive a packet containing Check-Offs which are basically practice problems for questions covered throughout the course. Think of these as homework problems that need to be turned-in. As you master the topics covered on each Check-Off, complete the questions and submit your packet for review. Each section (A – L) is worth 5 points. The Check-Offs need to be completed during class in order to receive credit.  (2) ALEKS Quizzes: In addition to automatic assessments produced by ALEKS based on your completion, ALEKS has the ability to construct exams at points indicated by the instructor. I tell ALEKS what material I want covered and the program constructs problems that test understanding of that material. You will need to complete a Quiz for each chapter of ALEKS, which should correspond to a chapter in your text. Each quiz will be worth 20 points. You can take the quizzes when you complete a chapter, however, there will be a due date at which point you must have the quiz completed whether or not you have finished the material on ALEKS. You can use your handwritten notes on the quizzes. DO NOT use the text.  Think of quizzes as a way to keep yourself on schedule for completing the course by the end of the semester.  * For each Quiz, although it will be taken online, you need to turn-in a paper/pencil copy of the questions with your work and answers at the end of the class period during which each Quiz is taken. At the completion of the Quiz, you will receive your score. If you do not pass a Quiz or plan to retake it, do not turn in your work. Study from it - - you are allowed one chance to re-take each quiz.  **REMINDER**These quizzes, even the re-takes, must be taken in the classroom!  A calculator is allowed for all in-class assessments EXCEPT for Quiz #1 .  _______________ __Quiz Schedule: _____________________  Due Date  Review & Chapter 1 January 24, 2007  Chapter 2 February 7  Chapter 3 February 14  Chapter 4 February 21  Chapter 5 March 14 Chapter 6 March 21  Chapter 7 March 28  Chapter 8 April 11  Chapter 9 April 18  Chapter 10 May 1  (3) ALEKS Modules Completed: On the last two days of class you will take a final assessment, triggered by me. The percentage you score on that assessment is the number of points you receive, based out of 100. This assessment must be completed in the classroom. If you do not finish in one class period, you MUST NOT log on to ALEKS again until you return the next day for class, at which time you can complete your assessment. You must leave record with me as to which problem you were on when you leave, and if you are not on that same problem when you return, you must take the assessment again in the Learning Center. You can use your handwritten notes. DO NOT use the text.  (4) Midterm and Final: The Mid-Term and Final will be a traditional hard-copy test. It will not be an online assessment. Some of you may not be on schedule for the assessments, and this will no doubt affect your performance and, in turn, your Mid-Term and final course grade. The lesson learned here is that part of success in a course is learning the material within a designated amount of time. You will be allowed one instructor-provided note card for notes to use with each test.  (5) Attendance: A major factor in learning mathematics is a regular and focused schedule of practice. You need to practice virtually every day, and for a considerable amount of time each day in order to establish a solid foundation in algebra. To help you work on ALEKS, classroom attendance is REQUIRED every day. I will be keeping track, and will contact you if you miss too many classes. Your attendance will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.  ALEKS Time: ALEKS keeps track of how much time you have put in as well as how much progress you have made. It is almost impossible to pass the class if you do not spend additional time outside of class on ALEKS. It is suggested that you spend an additional 2 to3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. This commitment will help ensure successful progress through ALEKS. I will be keeping track of your hours spent on ALEKS, and I will contact you if it appears you are not putting in enough time outside of class. Your total number of hours on ALEKS will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.  Schedule: Your starting point and rate of progress are based on your initial assessment and learning rate. Because ALEKS allows students to work at their individual pace, students will be at a variety of places in the material throughout the semester. Still, in order to pass the course and move into the subsequent course you will need to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the material within the semester's time constraints.  It is possible that some of you will actually complete the ALEKS course before the calendar indicates the semester is over, and that's fine. I will still have you take the final exam with the rest of the class on the scheduled date. And it is possible that some of you may reach December without completing the material. ALEKS offers a guarantee that if you do not pass the course despite having put in at least 80 hours, your license to use ALEKS can be renewed for a semester at no cost. In this case, you will be given a grade of "I" (Incomplete), allowing you to work towards completion of the course during the next semester. Of course, this is far from ideal since it means you could not yet enroll in the course you need to take for your major. Use the Quiz dates as a goal for completion!  Americans with Disabilities Act: If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations for this class, please see me and/or Wayne Wojciechowski, the campus ADA coordinator (MC 335, 796-3085), within ten days to discuss your needs.  Academic Honesty: Per University policy (handbook page 131), you are expected to do your own work for this class. This includes and is not limited to the completion of all ALEKS work, including practice within ALEKS, and assessments. One example of dishonest behavior would be allowing another student to work problems for you in ALEKS. A second example would be having another student take all or part of an online assessment for you. If it is suspected that you violated this policy, you will need to retake the assessment under supervision.  Important Dates:  Tuesday, May 1: Check-Offs Due  Wednesday, May 2 & Thursday, May 3: Completion Assessment on ALEKS  Friday, May 11: Course Final  No Class Meetings:  Monday, March 5 – Thursday, March 8: Spring Break  Monday, April 9: Easter Break  The policies and outline of this course are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.  Revised 1/9/07  Using ALEKS  You will need the ALEKS Student Access Code on the back of your ALEKS Users' Guide, purchased from the Bookstore. You will also need the Course Code for your section, which is listed below.  1st Type  the URL line of your browser. Then add the site to Your Favorites.  ALEKS will lead you through the process of creating an account. Above the Registered Users box you should click:  New User? Sign Up Now!  2nd To enroll in your specific section, you will need the appropriate course code:  WVT63-HTFFX Section 001 MRC 316  On the first day of class, each of you will log in and we will examine the basics of using ALEKS. I will ask you to work your way through the "Answer Editor" tutorial so that you become familiar with how to enter mathematical expressions for assessments, on-line work and quizzes. Then on the second day of class I will have you take the initial ALEKS assessment to get a baseline rating of your skills and readiness for the material in this course. It is important that you always put forth your best effort when taking assessments, because this is how ALEKS determines whether or not you have mastered the material already learned.  ALEKS keeps track of (and lets your instructor see) how much you have mastered and what you are ready to learn. Below are the topics covered in this course.

__label__0 2.1 Functions and Graphs  Introduction Using the objects and the persons around us, it is easy to make up a rule of correspondence that associates, or pairs, the members, or elements, of one set with the members of another set. For example, to each social security number there is a person, to each car registered in the state of California there is a license plate number, to each book there corresponds at least one author, to each state there is a governor, and so on. A natural correspondence occurs between a set of 20 students and a set of, say, 25 desks in a classroom when each student selects and sits in a different desk. In mathematics we are interested in a special type of correspondence, a single-valued correspondence, called a function.

Benjamin, Harvey Mudd College Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University Improve and expand your math potential—whether you're a corporate executive or a high-school student—in the company of Professor Arthur T. Benjamin, one of the most entertaining members of The Great Courses faculty. The Secrets of Mental Math, his exciting 12-lecture course, guides you through all the essential skills, tips, and tricks for enhancing your ability to solve a range of mathematical problems right in your head. Along the way, you'll discover how mental mathematics is the gateway to success in understanding and mastering higher fields, including algebra and statistics.  Course Lecture Titles  12 Lectures 30 minutes/lecture  1. Math in Your Head! Dive right into the joys of mental math. First, learn the fundamental strategies of mental arithmetic (including the value of adding from left to right, unlike what you do on paper). Then, discover how a variety of shortcuts hold the keys to rapidly solving basic multiplication problems and finding squares.  7. Intermediate Multiplication Take mental multiplication to an even higher level. Professor Benjamin shows you five methods for accurately multiplying any two-digit numbers. Among these: the squaring method (when both numbers are equal), the "close together" method (when both numbers are near each other), and the subtraction method (when one number ends in 6, 7, 8, or 9).  2. Mental Addition and Subtraction Professor Benjamin demonstrates how easily you can mentally add and subtract one-, two-, and three-digit numbers. He also shows you shortcuts using the complement of a number (its distance from 100 or 1000) and demonstrates the uses of mental addition and subtraction for quickly counting calories and making change.  8. The Speed of Vedic Division Vedic mathematics, which has been around for centuries, is extremely helpful for solving division problems—much more efficiently than the methods you learned in school. Learn how Vedic division works for dividing numbers of any length by any two-digit numbers.  3. Go Forth and Multiply Delve into the secrets of easy mental multiplication—Professor Benjamin's favorite mathematical operation. Once you've mastered how to quickly multiply any two-digit or three-digit number by a one-digit number, you've mastered the most fundamental operations of mental multiplication and added a vital tool to your mental math tool kit.  9. Memorizing Numbers Think that memorizing long numbers sounds impossible? Think again. Investigate a fun—and effective—way to memorize numbers using a phonetic code in which every digit is given a consonant sound. Then practice your knowledge by trying to memorize the first 24 digits of pi, all of your credit card numbers, and more.  4. Divide and Conquer Turn now to the last fundamental operation of arithmetic: division. Explore a variety of shortcuts for dividing by one- and two-digit numbers; learn how to convert fractions such as 1/7 and 3/16 into decimals; and discover methods for determining when a large number is divisible by numbers such as 3, 7, and 11.  10. Calendar Calculating The fun continues in this lecture with determining the day of the week of any date in the past or in the future. What day of the week was July 4, 2000? How about February 12, 1809? You'd be surprised at how easy it is for you to grasp the simple mathematics behind this handy skill.  5. The Art of Guesstimation In most real-world situations—such as figuring out sales tax or how much to tip—you don't need an exact answer but just a reasonable approximation. Here, develop skills for effectively estimating addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.  11. Advanced Multiplication Professor Benjamin shows you how to do enormous multiplication problems in your head, such as squaring three-digit and four-digit numbers; cubing two-digit numbers, and multiplying two-digit and three-digit numbers. While you may not frequently encounter these large problems, knowing how to mentally solve them cements your knowledge of basic mental math skills.  6. Mental Math and Paper Sometimes we encounter math problems on paper in our daily lives. Even so, there are some rarely taught techniques to help speed up your calculations and check your answers when you are adding tall columns of numbers, multiplying numbers of any length, and more.  12. Masters of Mental Math Professor Benjamin concludes his exciting course by showing how you can use different methods to solve the same problem; how you can find the cube root of large perfect cubes; how you can use the techniques you've learned and mastered in the last 11 lectures; and more.  Course Lecture Titles  12 Lectures 30 minutes/lecture  1. How Your Brain Works In order to best optimize your brain fitness, it's important to understand how the brain's circuitry works. After a brief introduction to the course, Professor Restak guides you through a range of intriguing topics, including the principles of brain operation, the organization of the brain, patterns of brain growth, and more.  7. Exercising Your Working Memory Focus now on working memory—the most important memory process of all and one that involves manipulating stored information. After an overview of the topic, dive into a series of engaging exercises that use your creativity, your powers of observation, and your heightened awareness to enhance and improve your working memory.  2. How Your Brain Changes Your brain and your intelligence can change throughout your life span. Here, look closer at the way changes in your brain can improve the way you function in your day-to-day life. Also, explore how a series of visual, sensory, and spatial exercises demonstrate the powerful effects of brain plasticity.  8. Putting Your Senses to Work Imaginative memory techniques—such as mnemonic devices and personal associations—have been used to improve memory for over 1,000 years. Try your hand at some of them right here, including "chunking" numbers to aid in number recall, creating a vivid story to memorize words, drawing free-form designs, and playing mental chess.  3. Care and Feeding of the Brain You can optimize your brain function by paying attention to three key habits: what you eat, how well you sleep, and how much you exercise. Ponder the science behind this three-pronged approach to caring for your brain, and come away with helpful tips you can apply to your own lifestyle.  9. Enlisting Your Emotional Memory Turn now to an aspect of memory we don't usually consider when thinking about the subject: emotional memory. How did scientists uncover this specific aspect of memory? How does it actually work? And what kinds of playful exercises can you perform to help you relive the emotional experience of your past?  4. Creativity and the Playful Brain What's the connection between daydreaming and creativity? What are four steps for increasing your creativity? Which puzzles are the best for optimizing your brain function—and how can you more efficiently solve them? Learn the answers to these and other questions in this fascinating lecture on creativity and the brain.  10. Practicing for Peak Performance Exceptional performers aren't born with "superior brains." Rather, anyone—thanks to brain plasticity—can achieve high performance levels in an area of interest through deliberate practice. Focus here on two aspects of deliberate practice: remaining fully aware of what you're doing, and concentrating on the most difficult aspects of your performance.  11. Taking Advantage of Technology Take a closer look at the impact of modern technology on how our brains function. You'll explore the positive and negative effects of electronic journals, personal computers, and more—with a lengthy discussion on the impact of one of today's most powerful and controversial influences on brain function: video games.  6. Enhancing Your Memory In the first of three lectures devoted to memory, Dr. Restak proves just how essential memory is to your brain's optimal functioning. After surveying the details of memory and its roots in the hippocampus, learn ways to sharpen your sense memory and augment both your short-term and long-term general memory.  12. Building Your Cognitive Reserve Professor Restak concludes his course with ways to immediately start optimizing your brain fitness. These include trying new and unexpected things, learning in an informal and self-directed manner, keeping things in perspective, opting to prioritize instead of multitask, developing an appreciation for art and music, and—surprisingly—preparing home-cooked meals.

__label__0 In grades 9-12, the mathematics curriculum should include the informal exploration of calculus concepts from both a graphical and a numerical perspective so that all students can--  determine maximum and minimum points of a graph and interpret the results in problem situations;  investigate limiting processes by examining infinite sequences and series and areas under curves;  and so that, in addition, college-intending students can--  understand the conceptual foundations of limit, the area under a curve, the rate of change, and the slope of a tangent line, and their applications in other disciplines;  analyze the graphs of polynomial, rational, radical, and transcendental functions.  Focus  This standard does not advocate the formal study of calculus in high school for all students or even for college-intending students. Rather, it calls for opportunities for students to systematically, but informally, investigate the central ideas of calculus--limit, the area under a curve, the rate of change, and the slope of a tangent line--that contribute to a deepening of their understanding of function and its utility in representing and answering questions about real-world phenomena.  Most of the mathematics described in the other 9-12 standards involve finite processes, such as determining a sequence of transformations that maps a figure onto a congruent figure or approximating a zero of a polynominal function using an iterative technique. In contrast, the concept of limit and its connection with the other mathematical topics in this standard is based on infinite processes. Thus, explorations of the topics proposed here not only extend students' knowledge of function characteristics but also introduce them to another mode of mathematical thinking.  Instruction should be highly exploratory and based on numerical and geometric experiences that capitalize on both calculator and computer technology. Instructional activities should be aimed at providing students with firm conceptual underpinnings of calculus rather than at developing manipulative techniques.  Discussion  The development of the calculus represents one of the great intellectual accomplishments in human history; perhaps the greatest achievement in the application of mathematics is the use of calculus in physics during the first third of this century. Today, methods of calculus are applied increasingly in the social and biological sciences, and in business as well. As students explore the topics proposed in this standard, it is important that they develop an awareness of, and appreciation for, the historical origins and the cultural contributions of the calculus.  The topics proposed for investigation in this standard should be developed as natural extensions of ideas students have previously encountered. The study of finite sequences and series recommended in the discrete-mathematics standard leads naturally to consideration of the corresponding infinite cases and concepts associated with limiting processes. Considerations of infinite sequences and series can occur at many different levels of abstraction and formalism. Consider, for example, the series  At a very concrete level, this series can be summed in parts, as shown in figure 13.1.  Fig. 13.1.An informal approach to infinite series  At a somewhat higher but still intuitive level, the series can be summed by investigating the limit of the sequence of partial sums (either by using a calculator or a simple looping computer program or by applying the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series). An understanding of the concept of limit in contexts such as this should in turn contribute to the meaningful development of the remaining topics in this standard.  Similarly, it is important that all students recognize how the concept of the area under a curve builds on and extends their previous experiences with areas of geometric figures. College-intending students also should recognize how the rate of change builds on and extends their experiences with uniform motion and associated rates in algebra and trigonometry, and how the slope of a tangent to a curve generalizes the notion of the slope of a line as developed in algebra.  Many of these concepts can be approached through informal activities that focus on the understanding of interrelationships. For example, the concepts of slope, derivative, velocity, and acceleration could be addressed through experiences such as the following:  Given the velocity-time graph shown in figure 13.2, construct reasonable distance-time and acceleration-time graphs for the same system.  Note that correct responses may vary; for example, the distance-time graph could be translated vertically.  Computing technology makes the fundamental concepts and applications of calculus accessible to all students. The area under a finite portion of a curve, for example, can be approximated geometrically by partitioning the region into rectangles with bases of equal length and heights given by function values at an endpoint of each base. Using a calculator or a computer-based algorithm, students can easily sum the areas to obtain a numerical approximation of the desired area. This approximation can then be sharpened by using sequences of rectangles whose bases are made to decrease toward zero. Project work might require students to investigate other ways of partitioning the region so as to obtain a more precise estimate. (A description of a process using trapezoids can be found in the standard on mathematical connections.)  All students could use a graphing utility to investigate and solve optimization problems, including the maximum-minimum problems traditionally associated with the first college-level course in calculus, without computing a derivative. (For an example, see Examples of Content Differentiation,) A great deal of mathematical understanding is reinforced in the context of solving these problems: data analysis, problem formulation, mathematical modeling, geometric topics, translation across multiple representations, and validation.  Using interactive graphing utilities, college-intending students could examine other characteristics of the graphs of functions, including continuity, asymptotes, end behavior (i.e., behavior as |x| ), and concavity. Moreover, such analysis can be applied with equal ease to the graphs of a variety of complicated functions and to curves specified by polar and parametric equations.  Computing technology also permits the foreshadowing of analytic ideas for college-intending students. From a computer-graphics perspective, for example, a differentiable function can be viewed as a function having the property that a small portion of its graph, when highly magnified, approximates a line segment. The "zoom in" feature permits students to magnify the graph of a function over a small interval to view the approximate segment representation and to compute the gradient (slope). Using the computer to plot successive gradients for a series of short intervals (see fig. 13.4) suggests a process that derives functions from functions.  Fig. 13.4.Using computer graphics to see that the derivative of y = sin x is y = cos x  Although developing a foundation for the future study of calculus remains a goal of the 9-12 curriculum for college-intending students, equally important is the development of prerequisite understandings for further study of statistics, probability, and discrete mathematics. This standard calls for a new balance of skills, concepts, and applications in that portion of the curriculum traditionally associated with preparation for calculus. Instead of devoting large blocks of time to developing a mastery of paper-and-pencil manipulative skills, more time and effort should be spent on developing a conceptual understanding of key ideas and their applications. All students should have the benefit of a computer-enhanced introduction to some of the types of problems for which calculus was developed.

__label__0 MAA Review  [Reviewed by Fernando Q. Gouvêa, on 05/20/2010]  Lie groups play such a central role in mathematics and its applications that all mathematics students should be aware of them. From computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere. Nevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.  Of course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on "Very Basic Lie Theory" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared. Harriet Pollatsek's Lie Groups is her entry in this list.  Howe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.  Lie Groups is fundamentally a problem book: each chapter presents a sequence of problems that students should solve. In each chapter, the main sections are followed by a summary section called "Putting the pieces together." Finally, a section called "A broader view" tries to give a wider context to the material in that chapter. Everything important is done through problems. Thus, this is a book to be used, not a book to be read.  I must admit that I find teaching this material to sophomore mathematics majors to be a little bit too much of a reach. Instead, I used the book in a seminar course that followed our standard one-semester introduction to abstract algebra. In the class were six seniors, three juniors, and (yes!) a sophomore; all had taken algebra, either in the previous semester or a year before. Most, but not all, had taken other advanced courses as well, including Real Analysis. My students were assigned problems to solve and present in class, and we developed the theory in that way. Every once in a while, I would step in and give a broader view.  Did it work? Yes, it mostly did, though in the process I discovered that some aspects have to be tweaked a little bit. Because Pollatsek doesn't want to assume any algebra background, there are lots of "check that SL(2,R) is a group" problems — more than I or my students wanted. Because she doesn't want to assume much knowledge of topology, she does not have the chance to make much of connectedness, compactness, covering spaces, and (most significant in this context) simple connectedness. This seems like an opportunity lost.  Some choices I just don't understand. Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere? (My students were fascinated.) Why work only with the one-dimensional Lorenz group? Why not have more pictures? After all, it's easy to draw pictures of the one-dimensional Lie groups.  In many of the problems, there is more handholding than I wanted my students to have; at some points, this included "hints" that led towards unnecessarily messy ways of doing things. Pollatsek clearly thinks that students at this level prefer computation to theory. She is probably right, but I would rather not indulge that preference.  Some issues had to do with the fact that my students knew some things that her students didn't (what a group is, what a normal subgroup is) but did not have a sure grasp of some things that her students clearly do have well under control (the example that stands out in my mind is the Jacobian matrix of a differentiable map). The bibliography is also a little strange, too selective for my taste. This proved significant towards the end, when my students were working on term papers and all of them wanted the same books… which were not in our library.  There is no representation theory at all. The adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context. With no representation theory, one cannot do much more than say "the physicists use this a lot," without showing how or why. That seems like a pity.  Pollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book. Using it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing. If that applies to you, give this book a try.  Fernando Q. Gouvêa is Carter Professor of Mathematics at Colby College. He'll be doing the Lie groups thing again soon.
__label__0 To introduce students to selected topics of combinatorics and elementary analytic number theory.  Intended Learning Outcomes:  On successful completion of the course students will be:  Able to use generating functions to solve a variety of combinatorial problems  Proficient in the calculation and application of continued fractions.  Pre-requisites:  None  Dependent Courses:  None  Course Description:  The combinatorial half of this course is concerned with enumeration, that is, given a family of problems P(n), n a natural number, find a(n), the number of solutions of P(n) for each such n. The basic device is the generating function, a function F(t) that can be found directly from a description of the problem and for which there exists an expansion in the form F(t) = sum {a(n)gn(t); n a natural number}. Generating functions are also used to prove a family of counting formulae to prove combinatorial identities and obtain asymptotic formulae for a(n).  In Number Theory we look at the question of identifying irrational numbers and approximating them by rationals. We introduce continued fractions which we study in detail. These lead also to solutions of certain equations (Pell's equations) in integers. When identifying irrational numbers we find criteria which guarantee that a number is transcendental.

This video covers the differential notation dy/dx and generalizes the rule for finding the derivative of any polynomial. It also extends the notion of the derivatives covered in the Khan Academy videos, �Calculus Derivatives 2� and �Calculus Derivatives 2.5 (HD).� Note: Additional practice using the power rule for differentiating polynomials (including some with negative exponents) is available to the listener.  This video is the 4th in a series of videos that explains derivatives. First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.  This video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.  Continuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions. Note: The current set of practice problems titled �Chain rule 1� cannot be solved until one knows how to find the derivative of ex and trigonometric functions  In the first example, instead of actually using the quotient rule, Sal rewrites the denominator as a negative exponent and uses the product rule. In subsequent examples, Sal shows, but does not prove, the derivative of several interesting functions including ex, ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x.  After defining L�Hopital�s rule, Sal shows an example of using the rule to solve for the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x) / x. He also describes what it means for a fraction to have indeterminate form.  After applying L�Hopitals Rule once and showing that the limit is still indeterminate, Sal applies the rule a second and third time before arriving at a limit that exists. He then shows that given that the final limit exits, so do the previous ones including the limit of the first original problem. Note: Practice problems on L�Hopital�s rule are available and can be practiced now or after watching the other example videos.

__label__0 The Cartoon Guide to Calculus Cartoon Guide to Calculus  Calculus is the mathematics of change...and The Cartoon Guide to Calculus represents a big change from previous books on this subject. Using graphics and humor to lighten what is often perceived as a challenging discipline, Larry Gonick teaches all of the essentials, from functions and limits to derivatives and integrals.  The cartoon's unnamed narrator, with the help of his friend Delta Wye, guides us through a vast range of concepts. We see, for example, how calculus was initially conceived by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz as a way of resolving age-old mysteries involving the calculation of motion. Newton and Leibniz make several cameo appearances within the book, sometimes to quibble with each other regarding who invented calculus first, but mostly to explain a new concept to us. It's fun to learn about instantaneous velocity with an example involving Newton jumping up and down on a trampoline.  We go on to study a vast range of functions—Gonick invents a function creature to show how they work. We also are treated to a visual definition of the limit that is significantly easier to understand than the algebraic version that has traditionally been taught to generations of students. Learning derivatives in calculus has always involved diagrams, but not quite as vividly as in this book. For example, at one point, the narrator finds himself in a rapidly filling pool of water in order to calculate the instantaneous rate of flow. Equally refreshing is the way the book shows us a sphere literally being cut up into slices in a section that illustrates how to calculate its volume.  Complete with end-of-chapter exercises, The Cartoon Guide to Calculus will inspire even the most math-phobic among

__label__0 MAA Review  [Reviewed by Peter Rabinovitch, on 09/22/2011]  A rule I have found to be true is that any book claiming to be suitable for beginners and yet leading to the frontiers of unsolved research problems does neither well. This book is the exception to that rule.  A glance at the table of contents reveals many of the standard combinatorics topics. As the title implies, they are generally explored via bijections. As a user of combinatorics, rather than a dyed in the wool combinatorialist, I find bijections to be the central core of the subject and so I found this book engaging.  The proofs are very clear, and in many cases several proofs are offered. For example, there may be an algebraic proof of an identity, followed by a bijective proof.  This book could serve several purposes. By focussing on the first half of the book, it could be an excellent choice for a first course in cominatorics for senior undergraduates. By selecting topics and/or moving quickly, it could work well for a more mature audience. The book is at a higher level than Stanton & White, but lower than Stanley, thus it also makes a great reference for people who use combinatorics but are not specialists.  There are many exercises. The back cover claims nearly 1000, and although I didn't count them, I have no reason to doubt this claim. Some are very simple, and some are hard — the back cover claims some are unsolved. Many of the exercises are discussed in an appendix, ranging in detail from mere hints to "draw a diagram" to full but terse solutions. Because there are so many exercises, and because the level of detail of the provided solutions varies so much, an instructor using this text could easily find appropriate problems for assignment for courses of various levels of sophistication.  There are few obvious typos.  On the negative side, the book's web site is empty, and the author uses "quantum numbers" and "quantum binomial coefficients" etc. rather than the more common "q numbers" and "q binomial coefficients."  This is a very nice book that deserves serious consideration.  Peter Rabinovitch is a Systems Architect at Research in Motion, and a PhD student in probability. He's currently thinking about applications of Mallows permutations.
__label__0 much  I cannot believe that all of this was crammed into ONE 8 week college course. I'm still getting over the stress of trying to make it through this course. The book is ok if you understand math, but if you don't, you're just going to be more lost than you were before you started. Very confusing stuff.
__label__0 Unit Overview: The NCTM Algebra Standards for Grades 9-12 indicate that "All students should generalize patterns using explicitly defined and recursively defined functions and identify essential quantitative relationships in a situation and determine the class or classes of functions that might model the relationships." This unit will provide students with opportunities to extend various patterns in order to find specific terms in a pattern, by exploring linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. Investigations will include comparing the properties of the functions such as domain and range, parameter changes, and recursive and explicit rules for the functions.  Unit Plan: The student will recognize, name, and analyze recursive and explicit patterns in linear, quadratic, and exponential functions  Essential Questions to Guide the Unit and Focus Teaching and Learning:  1. How do patterns help us represent, analyze, make predictions, and draw and justify conclusions from sets of data?  2. How can we use patterns to communicate mathematical ideas?  3. How do patterns, relations, and functions help us understand our world?  4. How do you use patterns, relations, and functions to solve problems?  Unit Strands: 1 = Primary, 2 = Secondary  1  Algebraic Relationships  2  Data & Probability  2  Number and Operations  A1C10: Compare and contrast various forms of representations of patterns.  A1D10: Understand and compare the properties of linear, quadratic and exponential functions (include domain and range)  A1E10: Describe the effects of parameter changes on quadratic and exponential functions.  G4B10: Draw or use visual models to represent and solve problems.  Unit Relationship to Grade-Level Expectations:  In this unit, students develop the mathematics skills listed in the Targeted Learning column below. While supporting students in the development of these skills, teachers should consider students' previous learning and keep in mind their future learning.
__label__0 Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) is a Web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system. ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and doesn't know in a course. ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics they are most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKS periodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics are also retained.  The Basic Algebra courses will be taught using the software ALEKS. It is possible for students to accelerate through the Basic Algebra sequence by completing the courses early and then following the change of section process. This process starts with printing the Math Emporium Course Section Change Form (See below) and going to see your current Basic Algebra instructor. Have the instructor fill out the top of the form and bring the signed form to the Math Department located in MSB 233

__label__0 Synopsis  If you are having difficulty learning math, you already know you are not alone. Many people struggle with math. In fact, it is the one discipline in which low grades and low performance are almost universally acceptable because they are so common. For example, a parent is more likely to excuse a lower report card grade in math than in any other subject because that parent probably got lower grades in math when he or she were in school. But why is math so hard to learn? If we look at the nature of learning math it will become easy to see why it is almost a miracle that anyone (without some innate talent) ever learns math. The following "Top 10" can give you insights into how to learn math and help you understand the different pieces that must come together for you to not only learn math but enjoy the journey. 2,636 words.

__label__0 Suggested Project Topics  Here are a few ideas for project topics for final year, higher diploma, and Masters students. The only common thread is that they combine some mathematics with compuation.  1. Program a LEGO Robot using Matlab  The goal will be to learn how to programme real-time systems, model-based design, and develop object oriented Matlab code. These can be applied to contoling LEGO Mindstrom NXT robot.  2. The Singular Value Decomposition, and it's applications.  The singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important factorization of a matrix with interesting applications to a wide variety of areas such as image and signal processing, data compression, computational tomography, etc.. For one example of the the SVD can be applied to problems involving in face recognition, see Singular Value Decomposition, Eigenfaces, and 3D Reconstructions by Neil Muller, Lourenco Magaia, B.M. Herbst  You should consider this project if you like Linear Algebra. Some computing will be essential, but not necessarily anything too difficult.  3. Numerical Algorithms for Parallel Computers  Many classical numerical methods were designed for single-processor computers. Examples include Gaussian elimination or Numerical Integration. With the advent of parallel, multiprocessor and distributed systems, there is a need to revisit many of these methods and to see how they can be adapted for parallel computation.  A different example is Schwarz Methods for linear boundary value problems. These have existed for over 100 years, but are being ``rediscovered'' because they are so suitable for parallel computers  A project on this topic would mainly involve programming and algorithm design. Code could be tested on some Linux computers running software to emulate parallel and distributed systems.  The student who does this project should like programming. It would be useful to have studied numerical analysis.  4. Simulating Small-World Networks  Many networks that occur naturally have two properties: clustering and short average path-lengths. This is called the small world phenomenon and is related to research activities in very diverse areas. To verify this, check a web search engine for such topics as Six Degrees of Separation and The Kevin Bacon Game  A student working on this project will, at the very least, read a number of articles on the topic, learn enough mathematics to understand some of the theorems and conjectures in the area, and write some computer programs to simulate these networks.  The project would suit a student with interests in programming and graph theory. Some knowledge is stochastic processes and Markov chains would be useful.  5. Topics in Numerical Analysis  Numerical Analysis is the area of mathematics that is concerned with the design and analysis of methods and algorithms for obtaining useful solutions to mathematical problems. Two of the main sources of problems are differential equations and linear algebra. The applications are far too numerous to mention.  The interested student should browse a few books in the library.

While rigorous enough to be used as a college or ...Show synopsisWith a "learn-by-doing" approach, it reviews and teaches elementary and some intermediate algebra. While rigorous enough to be used as a college or high school text, the format is reader friendly, particularly in this Second Edition, and clear enough to be used for self-study in a non-classroom environment. "Pre-test" material enables readers to target problem areas quickly and skip areas that are already well understood. Some new material has been added to the Second Edition and redundant or confusing material omitted. The first chapter has undergone major revision. Chapters feature "post-tests" for self-evaluation. Thousands of practice problems, questions and answers make this algebra review a unique and practical
__label__0 Lynn Foshee Reed  Lynn Foshee Reed has been a mathematics instructor at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School (MLWGS) in Richmond, Virginia, since 1998. Reed primarily taught calculus – AP Calculus AB as well as dual enrollment Calculus I, Calculus II, and Multivariable Calculus – in conjunction with Virginia Commonwealth University. She has also taught Algebra II, Trigonometry and Mathematical Analysis, and History of Mathematics at MLWGS. Previously, Reed taught mathematics at Virginia Tech for eight years.  Reed originates from southern Illinois and she received her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and minored in chemistry at the University of Evansville. After two years of teaching high school, she enrolled at Ohio State University where she received both her Master of Arts and Master of Science in Mathematics. Reed earned her Gifted Education endorsement in 2002 and achieved National Board Certification in Adolescent and Young Adult Mathematics in 2009.  Reed is Secondary Mathematics Representative on the board of the Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics (VCTM), and she was VCTM's representative to the Virginia Educational Technology Advisory Committee. Reed is a past president of the Greater Richmond Council of Teachers of Mathematics (GRCTM). She is one of the coordinators of the Calculus Network of Richmond, and she regularly presents at GRCTM and VCTM conferences. Reed is a more than 20-year member of both the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Reed has experience as an AP Reader of AP Calculus exams, and she is a frequent calculus instructor for the Virginia Advanced Study Strategies review sessions.  Lynn welcomes opportunities to stretch her understanding of the world in general and mathematics in particular, and tries to demonstrate a delight in mathematics and joy in learning new things to her students and colleagues. She participated in the Institute for the History of Mathematics and Its Use in Teaching and the MAA's summer 2005 Professional Enhancement Program workshop on the "Mathematics of Asia's Past." She has participated in MAA mini-courses, most recently "Geometry and Art" and "Dance and Mathematics" at the 2012 Joint Mathematics Meetings. Lynn brought university-affiliated guest speakers to her school to expose students to mathematics in unexpected contexts like Sudoku, origami, sports, and history. "I have always been a proponent of using multidisciplinary explorations in teaching mathematics, and I emphasize to my students how mathematics opens doors to many careers and fields of interest. The mission of my school emphasizes government and international studies, and I strive to instill the viewpoint that mathematics permeates and supports nearly all other disciplines, and that as future leaders, they will benefit from studying as much mathematics as possible."  Reed is serving her Fellowship at the National Science Foundation, Arctic and Antarctic Sciences Division, Office of Polar Programs.
__label__0 Fill out this form to do the assignments or see your grades.  Login  Last Name:First Name:Student ID: CalNet Email address at the beginning of the term:  Assignment Schedule  General Instructions for Assignments  Your browser must be configured to accept cookies, to allow pop-up windows and to use JavaScript and Java. Generally, it is a good idea to set up your browser to verify each document every time it is loaded, rather than to use a cached copy. That will ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of every assignment.  SticiGui assignments combine forms, instructions, and interactive tools to reinforce the material presented in the chapters and to assess your understanding. The assignments use two frames. The upper frame has the instructions and a form for your responses; the bottom frame has tools you might need to solve the problems, such as graphs, calculators, etc.  To access the assignments, you must provide the following identifying information:  last name, first name, student ID, email address.  At the bottom of the instruction frame, after all the questions, there are three buttons: one to submit the assignment for grading, one to save your intermediate results on your computer, and one to clear the answer form.  You must click the submit button to send your answers to be graded.  After you click the submit button, you must click another button to confirm that you really want to submit your answers for grading.  You will get confirmation in this window of your browser that your assignment was received by the server (a message from AutoGrader). Your score will be posted to the web.  After the due date, there will be no "submit" button. If the submit button is missing, but the assignment is not yet due, the clock on your computer is set incorrectly.  To see your grades, you need to enter your name, email address and SID, to protect your privacy. Click the button just under the assignment list, near the top of this page. Also, if you go back to the assignment after the due date, you can see the correct answers to your unique version of the assignment.  You can save intermediate results on the assignment using a button at the bottom of the instruction page. The assignments also save themselves on your computer when you submit them, if you have your browser configured to accept cookies. That lets you resubmit the same answers again in case, for some reason, your submission does not get to the server, and lets you see your answers with the correct answers conveniently, after the due date. Note: cookies are not very reliable. Some things will cause or require your cookies to be deleted. To use the save feature, you must use the same computer every time you work on a given assignment. You can use different computers for different assignments. After filling out the identifying information at the top of this page to access the assignments, the computer will look for a record of your previous work on the assignment on the computer you are using. If it finds your previous work, the assignment will have your previous answers filled in. If it does not find your previous work, the answer fields will be blank. Many of the questions and data in assignments are generated randomly. Different students get different questions and different data. You are scored based on the questions and data you receive.  Questions with multiple-choice answers. There are two types of questions with multiple-choice answers. The first kind allows you to select only one response. The second kind asks you to "select all that apply." How to select more than one answer depends on the computer operating system and browser. In Netscape and Firefox on unix systems, click each answer you want to select; clicking an answer again de-selects it. On Windows systems, hold down the control (ctrl) key while clicking each response to select more than one. On Macintosh systems, hold down the "apple" key to select multiple responses. In such "multiple-multiple-choice" questions, if you select an answer that is not correct, or fail to select one that is correct, you will not receive credit--there is no partial credit.  Numerical answers. The grader strips commas from numbers, so you are free to punctuate numerical responses. If your response includes a percent sign at the end, your numerical answer will be converted to a percentage (divided by 100). Scientific notation (e.g., 4.23e-7 as shorthand for 0.000000423) will work; do not put a space between the digits and the letter "e." Questions that do not have an exact numerical answer accept a small range of answers as correct. The precision required depends on the problem statement. When in doubt, don't round off your final answer. In this class, there is no such thing as an answer that is "too precise." Never round off intermediate calculations: see Assignment 0.  Troubleshooting  Most technical problems with the online book and assignments have one of three causes:  Clearing Cookies  Cookies are small text files stored on your computer. SticiGui uses cookies to store your answers to assignments and to remember your student ID when you log in to do an assignment or check your scores.  Some browsers do not digest cookies very well (Microsoft Internet Explorer has more trouble than Opera, Mozilla and Firefox, in my experience). You might get an error message that you need to clear the cookies in your browser. When you delete the cookies, your stored assignment answers will be erased, but the server will still retain your submitted answers and your scores---only the local record on your computer is affected. Current browsers allow you to delete cookies easily. In Firefox 2.0, you clear cookies using the Tools->Options->Privacy->Cookies menu. Click "Clear Cookies Now." In Opera 9.1, you clear cookies using the Tools->Delete Private Data->Advanced menu.

__label__0 Mathematical Modes of Thought  Overview  This is a course in modern mathematics. We will be exploring a number of topics that have been developed fairly recently in the mathematical world.  This class will be nothing like your intermediate algebra course. If you prefer equations and expressions, this is not the class for you. We will be looking at topics that might not seem like math to you. Many of these topics will be explored in context of their applications.  The purpose of this course is to expose you to the wider world of mathematical thinking. There are two reasons for this. First, for you to understand the power of quantitative thinking and the power of numbers in solving and dealing with real world scenarios. Secondly, for you to understand that there is more to mathematics then expressions and equations.  Technical Expectations  To be successful in this course, you will need some technical skills. Most important is access to a computer with a reliable internet connection, and the ability to operate that computer and a web browser. If you are reading this, you're probably OK for this part. There will be a couple assignments that ask you to upload files, cut-and-paste internet addresses (URLs), etc. In most cases, a non-technical alternative is available if needed.  Is this course right for you?  Math 1080 is a terminal math course, meaning it does not prepare you for any other math class. This course is intended only for people who will be seeing only one mathematics class in college.  Hopefully you went to an adviser who knows your educational goals when deciding which class to take. If you're not sure if this class is right for you, please feel free to email me and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.  Textbook  I got tired of students having to pay over $100 for the book. So instead of using a traditional textbook, a book written by a friend from graduate school, David Lippman. The textbook is available online at  and is free.  Format of the Course  Each week there will be a specific set of material to learn, and assignments and tests on that material. There will be fixed due-dates for those assignments. However, the course is asynchronous, which means that you can log in any time during the week that is convenient for you and complete the assignments.  In addition to lecture, each week, you will be given a reading assignment. Attending Lectures and reading the textbook will be your primary way to learn the material for the course.  During class there will be frequent assignment, these can range from quizzes to group work. These assignments cannot be made up and make up a significant portion of your grade.  Outside of class a discussion forum will be provided where you can ask questions about the reading, and discuss the material with me and your classmates.In class you can ask me and we can discuss any problems you are having. Usually if you are having trouble, others are as well.  There will be a set of homework exercises assigned each week. The online homework exercises are required, and graded. However, if you miss a question, it will show the answer, allowing you to self-diagnose your mistake, and then you can try similar problems until you get the questions correct. You can ask questions in the discussion board about any homework questions you have difficulty with.  For each section there will be a "Skills Quiz". This will be a test consisting of problems similar, but not necessarily identical, to the homework problems, that test your understanding of the material and your ability to perform any procedures or techniques presented in that chapter. These questions will be numerical, multiple-choice, matching, or fill-in-the-blank.  Additionally, each week there will be an assignment not from the book. This assignment will be a more open-ended question that usually requires a bit more work, conceptual understanding, possibly some outside research, and may require a written solution or explanation. In some cases these may be collaborative assignments with intermediary due dates in the middle of the week. Be sure to keep track of the due dates.  Except in the case of collaborative assignments requiring feedback to fellow students, there are no graded forum response, email, or log-in frequency requirements. However, I strongly encourage you to not wait until the last day of the week to begin your assignments, as this does not allow time to seek out assistance if needed.  Midway through the course there will be a midterm exam and at the end of the course there will a final exam.  Learning Outcomes  The course learning outcomes (aka objectives) describe what abilities and skills a successful student is expected to develop and demonstrate in this course. While often related, these are separate from the course content (the specific topics we'll be covering)  Demonstrate a positive attitude towards mathematics and an appreciation for its power and uses.  Explore new and unfamiliar problems and employ critical thinking skills.  Form and communicate generalizations discovered through individual or group investigations.  Communicate methods of solutions and solutions to problems for the clarity of the receiver.  Model and solve problems using graphical methods.  Analyze and interpret data, as well as calculate statistical mean and median and use these to describe data.  Represent data using a histogram and/or other graphical forms.  Solve problems using algorithms or formulas.  Examine multicultural perspectives of at least one mathematical topic studied.  Solve, analyze, and effectively communicate the solution to problems of the instructor's choice.  Participate actively and responsibly in all course activities.  Within each sections folder, you will find a list of that sections topic-based learning outcomes, and how they related back to these course outcomes. You will be able to meet these learning outcomes by reading the book, making sure you understand the examples in the book, and working through the online exercises, seeking out assistance if you have difficulties. You will, of course, also need to apply your critical thinking skills, since part of the purpose of this course is to expand your ability apply the skills you've learned to new and different scenarios. In real life, problems rarely tell you how to solve them :)  Late Work Policy  The online Homework and Skills Test deadlines are extremely firm. The link to these assignments will actually disappear at midnight on the due date, and the assignment must be completed before midnight. Because of this, I strongly recommend that students not wait until 11:50pm to start the test, in case if they have problems logging in or something.  The Graded Assignments deadlines are also very firm, since you have the entire week to work on them. If a graded assignment is turned in late, I will never give more than 50% of the possible points.  If something major comes up (a death in the family, hospitalization, etc.), go ahead and email me or call me to let me know, and we can work something out.  Getting Help  The discussion board is a forum where you can ask questions about the reading or homework, and get help from me or your classmates. The idea is to have the class operate like a study group - with all of you working together to further your learning. This is what distinguishes an online class from a traditional distance learning or math lab course.  Use the Discussion Board to ask for help on problems you don't understand how to do. If you do understand how to do the problems, help out your classmates by answering questions on the discussion board.  I will monitor the homework discussion boards, and will respond to questions if they go unanswered, or if someone provides an incorrect response. If you have additional questions, didn't understand the answer someone gave you, or have a question that has gone unanswered, don't hesitate to email me and ask questions. However, please use the discussion boards first, so that others can benefit from your questions.  I can't stress enough that without being able to see the expression on your face, there's no way for me to judge if you understand my or a fellow student's explanation to your questions. So, you need to be proactive about your learning, and ask for more explanation when you need it. Again, you can do this via email to me, or in the discussion boards.  In addition to the discussion board and emailing me, you are also welcome to come see me on-campus if your schedule allows. See the Instructor Information to see what my office hours are this quarter.  Additionally, you can get help from the drop-in tutors at the Academic Support Center on either campus. Be aware that not all tutors have taken this math course, and may have difficulty helping you. Writing tutors are also available to help with writing assignments.  Instructor Contact  You can contact me via the discussion boards, email, messages, by phone, or in person.  If you have general questions about the course, you can ask them in the "Ask John" discussion forum. If the question is of a personal nature, feel free to email me.  If you have questions about the homework or readings, you can ask them in class. Feel free to email me, call me, or visit me in my office for additional help.  When you post a message or email me, please understand that I am not online all the time. Please allow at least 24 hours for me to respond to your questions, possibly longer on the weekends (up to 48 hours).  Grading  The first week of class there is a bio assignment and syllabus quiz.  Each week you will have online Homework.  Each section you will have a Skills Quiz.  Each section there will be a written/extended assignment.  There will be a midterm and final test.  The midterm exam will count 20% of your course grade.  In class assignments will count 20% of your course grade.  Online homework will count for 15% of your course grade.  Skills Quizzes will count for 15% of your course grade.  Written assignments will count for 15% of your course grade.  The Final will count for 20% of your course grade.  Your weighted percent in the class will be converted to a decimal grade via this scale:  90-100%: 3.5-4.0  80-89% : 2.5-3.4  75-79% : 2.0-2.4  70-74%: 1.5-1.9  60-69%: 0.7-1.4  Below 60%: 0.0  Academic Integrity  Online courses have the same academic integrity as any other college course. You can trust that I will respond to your questions and comments in a timely manner, as well as be timely and fair in grading submitted assignments.  As your instructor, I trust that you will make your best effort to complete the activities in a timely manner and to the best of your abilities. If there is an unforeseen change in your schedule feel free to contact me for alternative arrangements. I expect that the work you submit for this course will be your own work. Cheating and/or plagiarism will not be tolerated. Please refer to the college's Academic Dishonesty policy for more details.  Online Etiquette  Much has been written about online etiquette. The old saying, "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." is suddenly untrue. Words are our sole means of communication. Many times a sarcastic phrase you make to a friend is softened with a smile or eye contact. In an online situation, that same phrase can be very hurtful if read differently. Remember treat everyone the same way you would want to be treated: with respect.  There are ways to express emotions without words. These are called emoticons. You've probably seen several already in computer writing: ;-) :) :o) :-( etc., These are actually faces turned on their side to represent emotions. They take the place of body language and facial expressions that are a natural part of communication. In this setting, it's difficult sometimes to discern between sarcasm and criticism. Using emoticons can often convey the context of the comment when words can't.  Most importantly, this class will be free of sexual, verbal, and racial discrimination or harassment.  NC Policy  The NC policy has changed beginning with this semester. For a 100% refund the date is August 23 and for a 50% refund the date is September 1. The last day to obtain an NC is Friday Oct. 23. This is a hard deadline and will be enforced as such. The department will not approve any late NC requests. Students must request an NC through MetroConnect; faculty approval is no longer required. Holidays: Observance of religious holidays follows College policy, which is posted on the web at  in the Academic and Campus Policies for Students section. Each student is responsible for understanding and abiding by the policy. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: The Metropolitan State College of Denver is committed to making reasonable accommodations to assist individuals with disabilities in reaching their academic potential. If you have a disability that may impact your performance, attendance, or grades in this class and are requesting accommodations, then you must first register with the Access Center, located in the Auraria Library, Suite 116, 303-556-8387. Faculty Notification Letter, I would be happy to meet with you to discuss your accommodations. All discussions will remain confidential. Further information is available by visiting the Access Center website

__label__0 Launched in May, 2000, with the support of an NSF grant, Project WELCOME is a new part of the SUMMA Program. WELCOME brings together elements of three MAA program themes: academic technology, professional development, and promoting involvement of historically underrepresented groups. The general goals include:  Developing at minority serving institutions a community of teachers who create and use interactive, computer based, explorations of mathematics  Creating an internet library of these explorations available to teachers and students everywhere  Promoting the use of interactive explorations in teaching mathematics  Technology  The interactive explorations are integrated environments which combine graphical, dynamical, symbolic, textual, and numerical representations of mathematical ideas and relations. Users interact with these environments in the familiar point and click idiom of internet web pages. The goal of each activity is to encourage students to experiment with some mathematical context by manipulating aspects of the environment and observing the results. The interactions are intended to be so natural that the environments take on a kind of virtual realism that brings mathematical constructs to life. This can take the form of moving and deforming geometric objects (in the style of Geometer's Sketchpad), but can also involve interacting with symbolic, logical, and numerical aspects of an environment.  A past MAA effort, the Interactive Mathematical Text Project (IMTP), demonstrated that empowering teachers to create these activities is both feasible and desirable. In particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations. A showcase of these activities is freely available at the Mathwright website. Visitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.1), necessary for using the activities.  One of the goals of Project WELCOME is to produce series of interactive explorations that are directly tied to specific courses. The materials that are produced by the project will be distributed at a WELCOME Library on the internet, starting in the summer or fall of 2001.  Mathematical Involvement of Underrepresented Groups  The MAA has an ongoing interest in increasing the participation in mathematics of historically underrepresented groups. Project WELCOME is founded on the belief that technology can make a contribution in this area. The Project Directors believe that interactive mathematical explorations are a particularly attractive and powerful lure to the investigation of mathematical ideas. It is hoped that this lure will help attract students who might otherwise not elect to study mathematics.  In order to bring interactive mathematical explorations to these students, WELCOME is enlisting the aid of their teachers. The Project will build a community of Mathwright developers among faculty in institutions which predominantly serve the target populations. The role of teachers in developing, as well as using, Mathwright activities is intentional and significant. For one thing, creating the activities themselves will give the teachers a greater sense of ownership, and will assure that the activities will be compatible with the instructional goals and philosophies of these teachers. There is another reason to involve teachers as developers. Presumably, the historical under-participation among some student populations reflects particular obstacles that these students face. If so, then faculty at institutions which serve these populations may have special insights about the nature of the obstacles and strategies for overcoming them. Such insights will be a valuable resource in developing Mathwright activities for Project WELCOME.  Professional Development  Project WELCOME has many features in common with MAA professional development programs. The faculty developers will each be teamed with an experienced Mathwright user who will serve as a mentor and collaborator. The goals of the project go beyond training new Mathwright developers. The idea is to foster a community of teachers using interactive explorations. The community will interact electronically through email and a project web page. In addition, participants will get together at national MAA meetings, where they will be encouraged to make presentations of their work. In particular, there will be several contributed paper presentations related to WELCOME at the January, 2001 meeting in New Orleans.  Project Activities  Each year of the project begins with a workshop for new faculty particpants and mentors. In 2000, the summer workshop was held in Seattle, and was attended by 6 new faculty developers, 4 mentors, as well as the project directors. During the 2000-2001 academic year the developer teams will work on Mathwright activities related to the classes of the new faculty developers. Work in progress will be shared at the winter 2001 math meetings, and more completed work at the summer meeting. At about the same time, a new class of faculty developers will be meet in a workshop, as mentioned earlier.  The materials that are produced by WELCOME participants will be reviewed and critiqued by an outside board of editors. Ultimately, the finished products will be distributed over the internet at a Project WELCOME website.

__label__0 Secondary menu  Math and Media  In this class students will learn to apply math towards the creation of time based media. They will learn to author their own programs that analyze, convert, effect, and manipulate real time video and audio streams towards their own ends. Music is made, video is sequenced and stories are told Through the use of algorithms, conditionals, and operators. Media production is now firmly located in the digital domain and math has become an essential and flexible creative tool. Whereas packaged digital programs are designed around preconceived tasks, in this class artists pick up the equivalent of a stick, cram it in the digital morass and turn history on it's ear. The proof of this mathematics is in the making of media. This class will use Max/MSP/Jitter, a graphically based authoring program that allows one to program in a visual environment. In addition to real time video and audio processing students will learn to create 2D and 3D graphics and imbue them with interactive behaviors.
__label__0 Integral Calculus: An Introduction to the Anti-Derivative  If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The function for which the integral is calculated is called the integrand. The region over which a function is being integrated is called the domain of integration.  In this class, the presenter will introduce the concept of Integration. We will describe it as simply, the reverse process of differentiation, hence, also called Anti-Differentiation.  The integral may be found without a definite specification or for a particular region leading to the development of indefinite & definite integrals. In case of the definite integrals, the domain of integration is defined by specifying the upper & lower limits of the enclosed region. Also, definite integrals may not be referred to as anti-derivatives which is a term used only for indefinite integrals in accordance with the fundamental theorem of calculus. Besides, the indefinite integral may be a constant or a function of the independent variable however, the definite integral is always constant.  We will also discuss about the geometrical & physical representation & significance of the integral. When we look into the practical applications of integrals, they appear in a number of practical situations.  Consider a swimming pool. If it is rectangular, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. The best of problems in Physics too involve the integral.

__label__0 Robert Molina  Faculty Profile: Robert Molina the study of discrete (and usually finite) objects. In other words, it deals with arrangement of items such as books on a shelf or numbers in a defined set.  His interest in mathematics began at an early age, but his math preparation in high school was so bad that he had to take a remedial math class in college.  After leaving community college for a job, he chose mathematics as a major when he went back for his bachelor's degree because he wanted to finish in two years. He planned on teaching high school, but his class was so unruly during student teaching that he jumped on his professor's suggestion that he go to graduate school.  "I never realized I was that good at math," he says.  He came to Alma in 1993 and loves working with a wide variety of students.  "I like teaching mathematics in a liberal arts setting," he says. "I have the opportunity to teach students who might not like math, but end up having fun and learning in the class."  In his spare time, he likes to hike, collect guitars and stay physically active

__label__0 rational functions take two  Two weeks ago in my Algebra 2 Trig Honors class we were finishing up our unit on rational expressions, equations, and functions. In past years, students at this level had focused on graphing only simple rational functions – transformations of y=1/x. (In Precalculus, students are exposed to general rational functions.) I was feeling frustrated, though, at how limited this approach felt – I didn't want students to be misled into ignoring the big vast ocean full of rational functions after looking at a goldfish bowl-sized sample. (Questions like: "so it will always look like this?" were driving me crazy.) But at the same time, I didn't want to bog them down with a tedious approach to graphing general cases by hand. I just wanted my students to get a feel for all of the different crazy shapes these graphs can make, notice patterns, and begin the process of generalizing.  Last year I had included an investigation of general rational functions using Wolfram Alpha on a homework assignment. In hindsight, leaving this activity for homework wasn't a good call – there wasn't enough time for thoughtful follow-up, and by having students work alone they missed out on the magic of discussing their findings with others and building understanding together. So this year, I took an extra class day to allow students time to play around with more complicated rational functions on the Desmos calculator. (Which I am a little bit in love with.)  In my 2nd period class, I didn't do a great job of setting up and explaining what I had envisioned for the hour. I showed them the Desmos calculator, told them they should be graphing a variety of rational functions, and gave them a sheet with 4 specific examples with bullet points for guided questions underneath to use as a framework for their investigation. On the back board, I had written "What do you notice/what are you wondering about…" with different categories for them to record some of their findings throughout the hour. The idea was that throughout class, I would circulate and peek in on their conversations, help answer some questions or poke at their thinking a bit, they would record their observations and questions on the back board, and at the end of class we'd save 10 minutes to discuss our findings on the board.  As I turned students loose to begin working, some problems became evident pretty quickly. While students were comfortable recognizing the one vertical and one horizontal asymptote for simple rational functions, they couldn't "see" the asymptotes for the more complicated graphs. This to me indicated that they didn't have a good enough understanding of what an asymptote truly was, but instead had mastered an algorithm for graphing the simple rational functions. I tried to chat with groups of students to see where the disconnect was, and I encouraged students to graph the lines that they visually predicted were asymptotes – then connect that to the algebra of each function. I also realized I had not done a good job explaining or modeling the way they should record what they noticed/wondered on the back board – I ended up with lots of random pictures and little interpretation or generalizations. I also did a horrible job keeping track of the timing of the class. It became clear we weren't going to have the 10 minutes I wanted at the end of class to pull together our big findings – instead, I had to take pictures of the back board and wait until the next day to summarize their investigation.  There were more nuanced conversations than the sloppy work on the board indicated, but overall I wasn't happy with the way things had gone. I didn't feel like we had arrived at enough clarity or closure for the big ideas I wanted them to be tackling.  Lucky for me, I learned a bit from my mistakes and in my 4th period class I did a MUCH better job of setting up the activity. I graphed the first specific example on Desmos, talked through how I could visually "see" the 2 vertical asymptotes and 1 horizontal asymptote, showed them to graph those lines to confirm the asymptotic behavior, returned to the algebra of the example function to make connections between the algebra and the graph, then added a generalization to the board of noticing/wondering.  During this hour, the students did a better job of working together, asked me fewer questions, and were more able to generalize their findings. They even surprised me with some observations I was *not* expecting them to make (see the last one under "V.A.") and a few students figured out how to use sliders with Desmos to more efficiently explore how changing different bits of the function they graphed would impact its shape. You can tell by looking at their noticings/wonderings how much more successful my second shot at this lesson was. During the follow-up conversation at the end of class, I addressed all of the points on the board, asked for students to help respond to some of the questions, and felt that the majority of students left with a better understanding of both the important features of these graphs and how the algebra of the functions controls their shape.  Since I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit. General rational functions were not tested (only transformations of y=1/x), but I did decide to include a question that had students explain the shape of the parent function y=1/x. It was a great way for me to see if all of the investigation and conversation about the shapes of the graphs had paid off… were my students more "mathematically fluent" in the vocabulary and ideas associated with rational functions? I did have some very strong responses, and I've included my favorite below.  I'm sure there are ways for me to tweak and improve upon this lesson for future classes, but I was happy with the chance it afforded students to talk, play, investigate, and generalize.  Share this:  Like this:  Responses  Some comments and questions here * Love the guided questions along the way. Do you intend to move away from the more specific clues? Is the unit long enough for that? * Love the writing on the second set of board snapshots. Why is it that students are so determined to misspell the word vertical even when it is in the question that they are answering? * In addition to division for slant asymptotes, do you suggest division as a way to get at horizontal asymptotes as well? * How comfortable are your kids with 'washing away the remainder' in these processes? * I am intrigued by DESMOS – haven't used it. I'm partial to GeoGebra myself.  I like how you have students put their observations on the board – I'm not sure my algebra students are persistent enough in their investigations, but I would like to try something similar to this in Geometry. Have you ever done it with a class that is not honors?  No, that was actually my first time to have students record observations on the board like this. You can see how much better I modeled for students the types of things they should be recording in the 2nd class. I think I would be comfortable doing something like this in a non-honors class, but the investigation activity would have to be much more structured – I was asking a lot, conceptually, of my students here.

For students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, linear algebra/matrix theory is an absolute requirement. Linear Algebra is the mathematical study of vectors and vector spaces (also called linear spaces). Matrices are widely used to represent the linear transformations that input one vector and output another. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Calculus. The only REAL prerequisite for this material is a good knowledge of high school algebra. We have designated AB Calculus as a requirement because everyone will need strong algebra skills and good analytical ability. Linear Algebra has many practical applications, not limited to math/physics/engineering. It shows up in economics, logistics, finance, computer science, operations research, and lots of other disciplines.  For students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, advanced calculus is an absolute requirement. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Advanced Placement Calculus AB & BC. The material in these courses however, has generally been limited to one independent variable expressed in the form of y = f(x). Multivariable/vector calculus is used to describe phenomena that result from the simultaneous effects of many variables. For example, in the case of the ideal gas law from chemistry, the pressure of an ideal gas is a result of the number of moles of the gas, the volume of the container, and the temperature. We could express this as P = f(n,V,T). If all three are changed simultaneously, how is the pressure changed?  Pre-AP PreCalculus provides opportunities to study real numbers, functions and their graphs, trigonometric relationships, parametric representations, sequences, and series. This course provides the necessary foundation for advanced placement or college calculus. Extends and builds on the foundation for the Advanced Placement program. Includes all of the regular Precalculus course with extensions, both guided and independent, in the areas of symbolic logic, linear programming, applications of polar coordinates, and topics from discrete mathematics. Typically, after taking Pre-AP PreCalculus a student would take AP Statistics and/or AP Calculus AB.

__label__0 More About This Textbook  Overview  With an emphasis on problem solving, this book introduces the basic principles and fundamental concepts of computational modeling. It emphasizes reasoning and conceptualizing problems, the elementary mathematical modeling, and the implementation using computing concepts and principles. Examples are included that demonstrate the computation and visualization of the implemented models.  The author provides case studies, along with an overview of computational models and their development. The first part of the text presents the basic concepts of models and techniques for designing and implementing problem solutions. It applies standard pseudo-code constructs and flowcharts for designing models. The second part covers model implementation with basic programming constructs using MATLAB®, Octave, and FreeMat.  Aimed at beginning students in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and engineering, Introduction to Elementary Computational Modeling: Essential Concepts, Principles, and Problem Solving focuses on fundamentals, helping the next generation of scientists and engineers hone their problem solving skills.  What People Are Saying  From the Publisher  … offers a solid first step into scientific and technical computing for those just getting started. … Through simple examples that are both easy to conceptualize and straightforward to express mathematically (something that isn't trivial to achieve), Garrido methodically guides readers from problem statement and abstraction through algorithm design and basic programming. His approach offers those beginning in a scientific or technical discipline something unique; a simultaneous introduction to programming and computational thinking that is very relevant to the practical application of computing many readers will experience later in their academic training, or early in their professional career. —John West, SIGHPC Connect Newsletter, Vol. 1, June 2012  Related Subjects  Meet the Author  Jose M.

__label__0 While I do think that many pop-sci explanations of theoretical physics are fairly worthless and often actively misleading, I do not think that it is impossible to gain real insight into (say) the general theory of relativity without mastering differential geometry. Geroch's book presupposes only high school mathematics, but it provides a genuinely deep insight into relativity.  I described the requirements as algebra, analytic geometry, and basic calculus, which is more or less within advanced high-school math. (Without calculus, I don't see how you could explain integrals along the world line, which are the very heart of the matter.)  However, note that just high-school algebra is already worlds apart from purely prose-based, general-audience pop-science. I would guess that for an average reader (let alone owner) of pop-science books, following a text using algebra would be far harder than it would be to figure out tensors for a reasonably math-savvy twelfth grade student.

__label__0 Elementary Mathematics Courses. In order to accommodate diverse backgrounds and interests, several course options are available to beginning mathematics students. All courses require three years of high school mathematics; four years are strongly recommended and more information is given for some individual courses below. Students with College Board Advanced Placement credit and anyone planning to enroll in an upper-level class should consider one of the Honors sequences and discuss the options with a mathematics advisor.  Students who need additional preparation for calculus are tentatively identified by a combination of the math placement test (given during orientation), college admission test scores (SAT or ACT), and high school grade point average. Academic advisors will discuss this placement information with each student and refer students to a special mathematics advisor when necessary.  Two courses preparatory to the calculus, MATH 105 and 110, are offered. MATH 105 is a course on data analysis, functions and graphs with an emphasis on problem solving. MATH 110 is a condensed half-term version of the same material offered as a self-study course taught through the Math Lab and is only open to students in MATH 115 who find that they need additional preparation to successfully complete the course. A maximum total of 4 credits may be earned in courses numbered 103, 105, and 110. MATH 103 is offered exclusively in the Summer half-term for students in the Summer Bridge Program.  MATH 127 and 128 are courses containing selected topics from geometry and number theory, respectively. They are intended for students who want exposure to mathematical culture and thinking through a single course. They are neither prerequisite nor preparation for any further course. No credit will be received for the election of MATH 127 or 128 if a student already has credit for a 200-(or higher) level MATH course.  Each of MATH 115, 185, and 295 is a first course in calculus. Generally credit can be received for only one of 115 or 185. The sequence MATH 115-116-215 is appropriate for must students who want a complete introduction to calculus. One of 215, 285, or 395 is prerequisite to most more advanced courses in Mathematics.  The sequences MATH 156-255-256, 175-186-285-286, 185-186-285-286, and 295-296-395-396 are Honors sequences. Students need not be enrolled in the LS&A Honors Program to enroll in any of these courses but must have the permission of an Honors advisor. Students with strong preparation and interest in mathematics are encouraged to consider these courses.  MATH 185-285 covers much of the material of MATH 115-215 with more attention to the theory in addition to applications. Most students who take MATH 185 have taken a high school calculus course, but it is not required. MATH 175-186 assumes a knowledge of calculus roughly equivalent to MATH 115 and covers a substantial amount of so-called combinatorial mathematics as well as calculus-related topics not usually part of the calculus sequence. MATH 175 is taught by the discovery method: students are presented with a great variety of problems and encouraged to experiment in groups using computers. The sequence MATH 295-396 provides a rigorous introduction to theoretical mathematics. Proofs are stressed over applications and these courses require a high level of interest and commitment. Most students electing MATH 295 have completed a thorough high school calculus course. MATH 295-396 is excellent preparation for mathematics at the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate level.  Students with strong scores on either the AB or BC version of the College Board Advanced Placement exam may be granted credit and advanced placement in one of the sequences described above; a table explaining the possibilities is available from advisors and the Department. In addition, there is one course expressly designed and recommended for students with one or two semesters of AP credit, MATH 156. MATH 156 is an Honors course intended primarily for science and engineering concentrators and will emphasize both applications and theory. Interested students should consult a mathematics advisor for more details.  In rare circumstances and with permission of a Mathematics advisor, reduced credit may be granted for MATH 185 after MATH 115. A list of these and other cases of reduced credit for courses with overlapping material is available from the Department. To avoid unexpected reduction in credit, a student should always consult an advisor before switching from one sequence to another. In all cases a maximum total of 16 credits may be earned for calculus courses MATH 115 through 396, and no credit can be earned for a prerequisite to a course taken after the course itself.  Students completing MATH 116 who are principally interested in the application of mathematics to other fields may continue either to MATH 215 (Analytic Geometry and Calculus III) or to MATH 216 (Introduction to Differential Equations); these two courses may be taken in either order. Students who have greater interest in theory or who intend to take more advanced courses in mathematics should continue with MATH 215 followed by the sequence MATH 217-316 (Linear Algebra-Differential Equations). MATH 217 (or the Honors version, MATH 513) is required for a concentration in Mathematics; it both serves as a transition to the more theoretical material of advanced courses and provides the background required to optimal treatment of differential equations in MATH 316. MATH 216 is not intended for mathematics concentrators.  A maximum total of 4 credits may be earned in MATH 103, 105, and 110. A maximum total of 16 credits may be earned for calculus courses MATH 112 through MATH 396, and no credit can be earned for a prerequisite to a course taken after the course itself.  MATH 103. Intermediate Algebra.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Only open to designated summer half-term Bridge students. (Excl). May not be repeated for credit. A maximum of four credits may be earned in MATH 101, 103, 105, and 110.  MATH 105. Data, Functions, and Graphs.  THERE ARE JOINT EVENING EXAMS FOR ALL SECTIONS of MATH 105: WED, OCT 1 & MON, NOV 3, 6-8PM. ALSO A JOINT FINAL. CAUTION! AVOID SCHEDULING ANOTHER CLASS THAT CONFLICTS WITH THESE EVENING EXAMS.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: (4). (MSA). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit.Credits: (4).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  MATH 105 serves both as a preparatory course to the calculus sequences and as a terminal course for students who need only this level of mathematics. Students who complete MATH 105 are fully prepared for MATH 115.MATH 110. Pre-Calculus (Self-Study).Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: See Elementary Courses above. Enrollment in MATH 110 is by recommendation of MATH 115 instructor and override only. (2). (Excl). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who already have 4 credits for pre-calculus mathematics courses. A maximum of four credits may be earned in MATH 101, 103, 105, and 110.  Credits: (2).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  The course covers data analysis by means of functions and graphs. MATH 110 serves both as a preparatory class to the calculus sequences and as a terminal course for students who need only this level of mathematics. The course is a condensed, half-term version of MATH 105 (MATH 105 covers the same material in a traditional classroom setting) designed for students who appear to be prepared to handle calculus but are not able to successfully complete MATH 115. Students who complete MATH 110 are fully prepared for MATH 115. Students may enroll in MATH 110 only on the recommendation of a mathematics instructor after the third week of classes.MATH 115. Calculus I.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Four years of high school mathematics. See Elementary Courses above. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit usually is granted for only one course from among 115, 185, and 295. No credit granted to those who have completed MATH 175 uniform midterm and final exam. The course presents the concepts of calculus from three points of view: geometric (graphs); numerical (tables); and algebraic (formulas). Students will develop their reading, writing, and questioning skills.  Topics include functions and graphs, derivatives and their applications to real-life problems in various fields, and definite integrals. MATH 185 is a somewhat more theoretical course which covers some of the same material. MATH 175 includes some of the material of MATH 115 together with some combinatorial mathematics. A student whose preparation is insufficient for MATH 115 should take MATH 105 (Data, Functions, and Graphs). MATH 116 is the natural sequel. A student who has done very well in this course could enter the honors sequence at this point by taking MATH 186. The cost for this course is over $100 since the student will need a text (to be used for MATH 115 and 116) and a graphing calculator (the Texas Instruments TI-83 is recommended).  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 115. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit is granted for only one course from among MATH 116, 156, 176, and 186.  Credits: (4).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.MATH 147. Introduction to Interest Theory.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 115. (3). (MSA). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed a 200- (or higher) level mathematics course.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This course is designed for students who seek an introduction to the mathematical concepts and techniques employed by financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. Actuarial students, and other mathematics concentrators should elect MATH 424, which covers the same topics but on a more rigorous basis requiring considerable use of calculus. Topics covered include: various rates of simple and compound interest, present and accumulated values based on these; annuity functions and their application to amortization, sinking funds, and bond values; depreciation methods; introduction to life tables, life annuity, and life insurance values. This course is not part of a sequence. Students should possess financial calculators.  MATH 156. Applied Honors Calculus II.  Prerequisites & Distribution: Score of 4 or 5 on the AB or BC Advanced Placement calculus exam. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit is granted for only one course among MATH 116, 156, 176, 186, and 296.  Math 156 is a 2nd term Honors calculus course for engineering and science students. The course emphasizes applications of calculus, computational skills, and conceptual understanding. The prerequisite is a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement calculus AB or BC exam. Math 156 provides students with the calculus background they need for subsequent courses in engineering, math, and science.  The aim of Math 156 is to provide students with the math background they need for subsequent courses. Math 156 strikes a balance between theory and application. Theorems are stated carefully and several are proven, but technical details are omitted (though reference is made to higher-level math courses where such issues are discussed). The proofs are presented in easily understood steps, based on the course coordinator's prior experience. Examples are given to illustrate the theory.  The course starts by reviewing the definition of the integral as a limit of Riemann sums. The students presumably have seen this topic in their AP class, but many comment that the Math 156 treatment is different. The class moves quickly to topics that most students haven't seen before, including improper integrals, and applications such as work, center of mass, arclength, surface area, hydrostatic force, and probability density functions. Math 156 avoids the traditional segment on "methods of integration for their own sake"; instead the methods are discussed as they arise in concrete problems. Taylor approximation is discussed in some depth with emphasis on applications the students will likely encounter in later courses (e.g., far-field expansion for the electrostatic potential of a pair of charged particles).  Part I. Integration  sigma notation  area  definite integral  fundamental theorem of calculus  indefinite integrals  work  improper integrals  arclength  surface area  hydrostatic force, center of mass  probability density functions  Part II. Differential Equations  modeling with differential equations  exponential growth and decay  logistic equation  Part III. Series  sequences  series  integral test  comparison test  alternating series  absolute convergence, ratio test  power series  Taylor series  binomial series  applications of Taylor polynomials  Additional Topics (time permitting)  parametric curves  area defined by parametric curves  polar coordinates  complex numbers  Review (as needed)  substitution  inverse trigonometric functions  hyperbolic functions  L'Hopital's rule  integration by parts  trigonometric integrals  trigonometric substitution  partial fractions  The enrollment is roughly 1/2 engineering majors and 1/2 science majors. The class meets 4 times per week and each class is 50 minutes long. There are uniform weekly homework assignments and uniform exams (two 90 minute midterms and one 2 hour final exam). The homework assignments include problems from the assigned text and customized problems. The students are introduced to MAPLE in a computer lab. There is brief exposure to special topics such as Bessel function, Gamma function, error function, fractal sets, Laplace transform, polar coordinates, complex numbers.  Text: "Calculus" by James Stewart, 5th edition, Brooks/Cole Publishing Company  MATH 185. Honors Calculus I.  Section 001, 002The sequence MATH 185-186-285-286 is the Honors introduction to calculus. It is taken by students intending to concentrate in mathematics, science, or engineering as well as students heading 185. Honors Calculus I.  Section 003, 004Credits: (4).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  The sequence MATH 185-186-285-286 is the Honors introduction to calculus. It is taken by students intending to concentrate 214. Linear Algebra and Differential Equations.  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 115 and 116This course is intended for second-year students who might otherwise take MATH 216 (Introduction to Differential Equations) but who have a greater need or desire to study Linear Algebra. This may include some Engineering students, particularly from Industrial and Operations engineering (IOE), as well as students of Economics and other quantitative social sciences. Students intending to concentrate in Mathematics must continue to elect MATH 217.  While MATH 216 includes 3-4 weeks of Linear Algebra as a tool in the study of Differential Equations, MATH 214 will include roughly three weeks of Differential Equations as an application of Linear Algebra.  MATH 215. Calculus III.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 116, 119, 156, 176, 186, or 296 midterm and final exam. Maple software. MATH 285 is a somewhat more theoretical course which covers the same material. For students intending to concentrate in mathematics or who have some interest in the theory of mathematics as well as its applications, the appropriate sequel is MATH 217. Students who intend to take only one further mathematics course and need differential equations should take MATH 216.  MATH 216. Introduction to Differential Equations.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 116, 119, 156, 176, 186, or 296. Not intended for Mathematics concentrators. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit can be earned for only one of MATH 216, 256, 286, or 316 engineering and the sciences. Math concentrators and other students who have some interest in the theory of mathematics should elect the sequence MATH 217-316. After an introduction to ordinary differential equations, the first half of the course is devoted to topics in linear algebra, including systems of linear algebraic equations, vector spaces, linear dependence, bases, dimension, matrix algebra, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. In the second half these tools are applied to the solution of linear systems of ordinary differential equations. Topics include: oscillating systems, the Laplace transform, initial value problems, resonance, phase portraits, and an introduction to numerical methods. There is a weekly computer lab using MATLAB software. This course is not intended for mathematics concentrators, who should elect the sequence MATH 217-316. MATH 286 covers much of the same material in the honors sequence. The sequence MATH 217-316 covers all of this material and substantially more at greater depth and with greater emphasis on the theory. MATH 404 covers further material on differential equations. MATH 217 and 417 cover further material on linear algebra. MATH 371 and 471 cover additional material on numerical methods.  MATH 217. Linear Algebra.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215, 255, or 285 concentrators Therefore the student entering MATH 217 should come with a sincere interest in learning about proofs. The topics covered include: systems of linear equations; matrix algebra; vectors, vector spaces, and subspaces; geometry of Rn; linear dependence, bases, and dimension; linear transformations; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; diagonalization; and inner products. Throughout there will be emphasis on the concepts, logic, and methods of theoretical mathematics. MATH 417 and 419 cover similar material with more emphasis on computation and applications and less emphasis on proofs. MATH 513 covers more in a much more sophisticated way. The intended course to follow MATH 217 is 316. MATH 217 is also prerequisite for MATH 412 and all more advanced courses in mathematics.  MATH 285. Honors Calculus III.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 176 or 186, or permission of the Honors advisorSee MATH 185 for a general description of the sequence MATH 185-186-285-286.  Topics include vector algebra and vector functions; analytic geometry of planes, surfaces, and solids; functions of several variables and partial differentiation; maximum-minimum problems; line, surface, and volume integrals and applications; vector fields and integration; curl, divergence, and gradient; Green's Theorem and Stokes' Theorem. Additional topics may be added at the discretion of the instructor. MATH 215 is a less theoretical course which covers the same material.  MATH 289. Problem Seminar.  Instructor(s):  One of the best ways to develop mathematical abilities is by solving problems using a variety of methods. Familiarity with numerous methods is a great asset to the developing student of mathematics. Methods learned in attacking a specific problem frequently find application in many other areas of mathematics. In many instances an interest in and appreciation of mathematics is better developed by solving problems than by hearing formal lectures on specific topics. The student has an opportunity to participate more actively in his/her education and development. This course is intended for superior students who have exhibited both ability and interest in doing mathematics, but it is not restricted to honors students. This course is excellent preparation for the Putnam exam. Students and one or more faculty and graduate student assistants will meet in small groups to explore problems in many different areas of mathematics. Problems will be selected according to the interests and background of the students.  MATH 295. Honors Mathematics I.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Prior knowledge of first year calculus and permission of the Honors advisor. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 185.  Credits: (4).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  MATH 295-296-395-396 is the main Honors calculus sequence. It is aimed at talented students who intend to major in mathematics, science, or engineering. The emphasis is on concepts and problem solving, as well as the underlying theory and proofs of important results. Students interested in taking advanced mathematical courses later should seriously consider starting with this sequence. The expected background is high school trigonometry and algebra (previous calculus not required). This sequence is not restricted to students enrolled in the LS&A Honors Program. Real functions, limits, continuous functions, limits of sequences, complex numbers, derivatives, indefinite integrals and applications, and some linear algebra. MATH 175 and MATH 185 are less intensive Honors courses. MATH 296 is the intended sequel.  MATH 316. Differential Equations.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215 and 217. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. Credit can be earned for only one of MATH 216, 256, 286, or 316.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This is an introduction to differential equations for students who have studied linear algebra (MATH 217). It treats techniques of solution (exact and approximate), existence and uniqueness theorems, some qualitative theory, and many applications. Proofs are given in class; homework problems include both computational and more conceptually oriented problems. First-order equations: solutions, existence and uniqueness, and numerical techniques; linear systems: eigenvector-eigenvalue solutions of constant coefficient systems, fundamental matrix solutions, nonhomogeneous systems; higher-order equations, reduction of order, variation of parameters, series solutions; qualitative behavior of systems, equilibrium points, stability. Applications to physical problems are considered throughout. MATH 216 covers somewhat less material without the use of linear algebra and with less emphasis on theory. MATH 286 is the Honors version of MATH 316. MATH 471 and/or MATH 572 are natural sequels in the area of differential equations, but MATH 316 is also preparation for more theoretical courses such as MATH 451.  MATH 333. Directed Tutoring.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Enrollment in the secondary teaching certificate program with concentration in mathematics. Permission of instructor required. (1-3). (Excl). (EXPERIENTIAL). May be repeated for credit for a maximum of 3 credits. Offered mandatory credit/no credit.  Credits: (1-3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  An experiential mathematics course for elementary teachers. Students tutor pre-calculus (Math. 105) or calculus (Math. 115) in the Math. Lab. They also participate in a bi-weekly seminar to discuss mathematical and methodological questions. Mandatory Credit/No Credit grading.  MATH 371 / ENGR 371. Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: ENGR 101; one of MATH 216, 256, 286, or 316. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in Math 471This is a survey course of the basic numerical methods which are used to solve practical scientific problems. Important concepts such as accuracy, stability, and efficiency are discussed. The course provides an introduction to MATLAB, an interactive program for numerical linear algebra. Convergence theorems are discussed and applied, but the proofs are not emphasized.  Objectives of the course  Develop numerical methods for approximately solving problems from continuous mathematics on the computer  Implement these methods in a computer language (MATLAB)  Apply these methods to application problems  Computer language: In this course, we will make extensive use of Matlab, a technical computing environment for numerical computation and visualization produced by The MathWorks, Inc. A Matlab manual is available in the MSCC Lab. Also available is a MATLAB tutorial written by Peter Blossey.  MATH 385. Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers.  Instructor(s): Carolyn A Dean  Prerequisites & Distribution: One year each of high school algebra and geometry. (3). (Excl). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 485.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  All elementary teaching certificate candidates are required to take two math courses, MATH 385 and MATH 489, either before or after admission to the School of Education. MATH 385 is offered in the Fall Term, MATH 489 in the Winter Term. Enrollment is limited to 30 students per section; class-size limits will be STRICTLY enforced. Anyone who can elect MATH 385 in the Spring Term is urged to do so. It is the surest way to guarantee yourself a place in the course.  This course, together with its sequel MATH 489, provides a coherent overview of the mathematics underlying the elementary and middle school curriculum. It is required of all students intending to earn an elementary teaching certificate and is taken almost exclusively by such students. Concepts are heavily emphasized with some attention given to calculation and proof. The course is conducted using a discussion format. Class participation is expected and constitutes a significant part of the course grade. Although only two years of high school mathematics are required, a more complete background including pre-calculus or calculus is desirable. Topics covered include problem solving, sets and functions, numeration systems, whole numbers (including some number theory), and integers. Each number system is examined in terms of its algorithms, its applications, and its mathematical structure. There is no alternative course. MATH 489 is the required sequel.  MATH 395. Honors Analysis I.  Section 001.  Instructor(s): Mario Bonk  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 296 or permission of the Honors advisor. (4). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (4).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This course is a continuation of the sequence MATH 295-296 and has the same theoretical emphasis. Students are expected to understand and construct proofs. This course studies functions of several real variables. Topics are chosen from elementary linear algebra (vector spaces, subspaces, bases, dimension, and solutions of linear systems by Gaussian elimination); elementary topology (open, closed, compact, and connected sets, and continuous and uniformly continuous functions); differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions of a scalar; differential and integral calculus of scalar-valued functions on Euclidean spaces; linear transformations (null space, range, matrices, calculations, linear systems, and norms); and differential calculus of vector-valued mappings on Euclidean spaces (derivative, chain rule, and implicit and inverse function theorems).  MATH 404. Intermediate Differential Equations and Dynamics.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 216, 256 or 286, or 316. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This is a course oriented to the solutions and applications of differential equations. Numerical methods and computer graphics are incorporated to varying degrees depending on the instructor. There are relatively few proofs. Some background in linear algebra is strongly recommended. First-order equations, second and higher-order linear equations, Wronskians, variation of parameters, mechanical vibrations, power series solutions, regular singular points, Laplace transform methods, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, nonlinear autonomous systems, critical points, stability, qualitative behavior, application to competing-species and predator-prey models, numerical methods. MATH 454 is a natural sequel.  MATH 412. Introduction to Modern Algebra.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215, 255, or 285; and 217. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 512. Students with credit for MATH 312 should take MATH 512 rather than 412. One credit granted to those who have completed MATH 312.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This course is designed to serve as an introduction to the methods and concepts of abstract mathematics. A typical student entering this course has substantial experience in using complex mathematical (calculus) calculations to solve physical or geometrical problems, but is unused to analyzing carefully the content of definitions or the logical flow of ideas which underlie and justify these calculations. Although the topics discussed here are quite distinct from those of calculus, an important goal of the course is to introduce the student to this type of analysis. Much of the reading, homework exercises, and exams consists of theorems (propositions, lemmas, etc.) and their proofs. MATH 217 or equivalent required as background. The initial topics include ones common to every branch of mathematics: sets, functions (mappings), relations, and the common number systems (integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers). These are then applied to the study of particular types of mathematical structures such as groups, rings, and fields. These structures are presented as abstractions from many examples such as the common number systems together with the operations of addition or multiplication, permutations of finite and infinite sets with function composition, sets of motions of geometric figures, and polynomials. Notions such as generator, subgroup, direct product, isomorphism, and homomorphism are defined and studied.  MATH 312 is a somewhat less abstract course which substitutes material on finite automata and other topics for some of the material on rings and fields of MATH 412. MATH 512 is an Honors version of MATH 412 which treats more material in a deeper way. A student who successfully completes this course will be prepared to take a number of other courses in abstract mathematics: MATH 416, 451, 475, 575, 481, 513, and 582. All of these courses will extend and deepen the student's grasp of modern abstract mathematics.  MATH 416. Theory of Algorithms.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 312 or 412 or EECS 203, and EECS 281. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  Many common problems from mathematics and computer science may be solved by applying one or more algorithms — well-defined procedures that accept input data specifying a particular instance of the problem and produce a solution. Students entering MATH 416 typically have encountered some of these problems and their algorithmic solutions in a programming course. The goal here is to develop the mathematical tools necessary to analyze such algorithms with respect to their efficiency (running time) and correctness. Different instructors will put varying degrees of emphasis on mathematical proofs and computer implementation of these ideas. Typical problems considered are: sorting, searching, matrix multiplication, graph problems (flows, travelling salesman), and primality and pseudo-primality testing (in connection with coding questions). Algorithm types such as divide-and-conquer, backtracking, greedy, and dynamic programming are analyzed using mathematical tools such as generating functions, recurrence relations, induction and recursion, graphs and trees, and permutations. The course often includes a section on abstract complexity theory including NP completeness. This course has substantial overlap with EECS 586 — more or less depending on the instructors. In general, MATH 416 will put more emphasis on the analysis aspect in contrast to design of algorithms. MATH 516 (given infrequently) and EECS 574 and 575 (Theoretical Computer Science I and II) include some topics which follow those of this course.  MATH 417. Matrix Algebra I.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Three courses MATH 513.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  Many problems in science, engineering, and mathematics are best formulated in terms of matrices — rectangular arrays of numbers. This course is an introduction to the properties of and operations on matrices with a wide variety of applications. The main emphasis is on concepts and problem-solving, but students are responsible for some of the underlying theory. Diversity rather than depth of applications is stressed. This course is not intended for mathematics concentrators, who should elect MATH 217 or 513 (Honors). Topics include matrix operations, echelon form, general solutions of systems of linear equations, vector spaces and subspaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants, orthogonality, characteristic polynomials, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and similarity theory. Applications include linear networks, least squares method (regression), discrete Markov processes, linear programming, and differential equations.  MATH 419 is an enriched version of MATH 417 with a somewhat more theoretical emphasis. MATH 217 (despite its lower number) is also a more theoretical course which covers much of the material of MATH 417 at a deeper level. MATH 513 is an Honors version of this course, which is also taken by some mathematics graduate students. MATH 420 is the natural sequel, but this course serves as prerequisite to several courses: MATH 452, 462, 561, and 571.  MATH 419. Linear Spaces and Matrix Theory.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Four terms of college mathematics in MATH 513.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  MATH 419 covers much of the same ground as MATH 417 but presents the material in a somewhat more abstract way in terms of vector spaces and linear transformations instead of matrices. There is a mix of proofs, calculations, and applications with the emphasis depending somewhat on the instructor. A previous proof-oriented course is helpful but by no means necessary. Basic notions of vector spaces and linear transformations: spanning, linear independence, bases, dimension, matrix representation of linear transformations; determinants; eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Jordan canonical form, inner-product spaces; unitary, self-adjoint, and orthogonal operators and matrices, and applications to differential and difference equations.  MATH 417 is less rigorous and theoretical and more oriented to applications. MATH 217 is similar to MATH 419 but slightly more proof-oriented. MATH 513 is much more abstract and sophisticated. Math 420 is the natural sequel, but this course serves as prerequisite to several courses: MATH 452, 462, 561, and 571.  Instructor(s):  This course is an introduction to the mathematical models used in finance and economics with particular emphasis on models for pricing derivative instruments such as options and futures. The goal is to understand how the models reflect observed market features, and to provide the necessary mathematical tools for their analysis and implementation. The course will introduce the stochastic processes used for modeling particular financial instruments. However, the students are expected to have a solid background in basic probability theory.  Instructor(s):  This course explores the concepts underlying the theory of interest and then applies them to concrete problems. The course also includes applications of spreadsheet software. The course is a prerequisite to advanced actuarial courses. It also helps students prepare for the Part 4A examination of the Casualty Actuarial Society and the Course 140 examination of the Society of Actuaries. The course covers compound interest (growth) theory and its application to valuation of monetary deposits, annuities, and bonds. Problems are approached both analytically (using algebra) and geometrically (using pictorial representations). Techniques are applied to real-life situations: bank accounts, bond prices, etc. The text is used as a guide because it is prescribed for the Society of Actuaries exam; the material covered will depend somewhat on the instructor. MATH 424 is required for students concentrating in actuarial mathematics; others may take MATH 147, which deals with the same techniques but with less emphasis on continuous growth situations. MATH 520 applies the concepts of MATH 424 together with probability theory to the valuation of life contingencies (death benefits and pensions).  MATH 425 / STATS 425. Introduction to Probability.  Instructor(s): Mathematics faculty 425 / STATS 425. Introduction to Probability.  Section 001.  Instructor(s): Math 116 and 215. Topics include the basic results and methods of both discrete and continuous probability theory: conditional probability, independent events, random variables, jointly distributed random variables, expectations, variances, covariances. Different instructors will vary the emphasis. Math 525 is a similar course for students with stronger mathematical background and ability. Stat 426 is a natural sequel for students interested in statistics. Math 523 includes many applications of probability theory.Instructor(s): Kausch 427 / HB 603. Retirement Plans and Other Employee Benefit Plans.  Section 001.  Prerequisites & Distribution: Junior standing. (3). (Excl). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  An overview of the range of employee benefit plans, the considerations (actuarial and others) which influence plan design and implementation practices, and the role of actuaries and other benefit plan professionals and their relation to decision makers in management and unions. Particular attention will be given to government programs which provide the framework, and establish requirements, for privately operated benefit plans. Relevant mathematical techniques will be reviewed, but are not the exclusive focus of the course. MATH 521 and/or MATH 522 (which can be taken independently of each other) provide more in-depth examination of the actuarial techniques used in employee benefit plans. No textbook  MATH 429. Internship.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: Concentration in Mathematics. (1). (Excl). (EXPERIENTIAL). May be elected up to three times for credit. Internship credit is not retroactive and must be prearranged. May not apply toward a Mathematics concentration. May be used to satisfy the Curriculum Practical Training (CPT) required of foreign students. Offered mandatory credit/no credit.  Credits: (1).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  Credits is granted for a full-time internship of at least eight weeks that is used to enrich a student's academic experience and/or allows the student to explore careers related to his/her academic studies.  This course is a study of the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Concepts and proofs are emphasized; students must be able to follow as well as construct clear logical arguments. For most students this is an introduction to proofs. A subsidiary goal is the development of enrichment and problem materials suitable for secondary geometry classes. Topics selected depend heavily on the instructor but may include classification of isometries of the Euclidean plane; similarities; rosette, frieze, and wallpaper symmetry groups; tessellations; triangle groups; and finite, hyperbolic, and taxicab non-Euclidean geometries. Alternative geometry courses at this level are MATH 432 and 433. Although it is not strictly a prerequisite, MATH 431 is good preparation for MATH 531.  MATH 433. Introduction to Differential Geometry.  Section 001.  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215 (or 255 or 285), and 217. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This course is about the analysis of curves and surfaces in 2- and 3-space using the tools of calculus and linear algebra. There will be many examples discussed, including some which arise in engineering and physics applications. Emphasis will be placed on developing intuitions and learning to use calculations to verify and prove theorems. Students need a good background in multivariable calculus (MATH 215) and linear algebra (preferably MATH 217). Some exposure to differential equations (MATH 216 or 316) is helpful but not absolutely necessary. Topics covered include (1) curves: curvature, torsion, rigid motions, existence and uniqueness theorems; (2) global properties of curves: rotation index, global index theorem, convex curves, 4-vertex theorem; and (3) local theory of surfaces: local parameters, metric coefficients, curves on surfaces, geodesic and normal curvature, second fundamental form, Christoffel symbols, Gaussian and mean curvature, minimal surfaces, and classification of minimal surfaces of revolution. MATH 537 is a substantially more advanced course which requires a strong background in topology (MATH 590), linear algebra (MATH 513), and advanced multivariable calculus (MATH 551). It treats some of the same material from a more abstract and topological perspective and introduces more general notions of curvature and covariant derivative for spaces of any dimension. MATH 635 and MATH 636 (Topics in Differential Geometry) further study Riemannian manifolds and their topological and analytic properties. Physics courses in general relativity and gauge theory will use some of the material of this course.  MATH 450. Advanced Mathematics for Engineers I.  Section 001.  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215, 255, or 285. (4). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 354 or 454.  Credits: (4).  Course Homepage: No homepage submittedMATH 451. Advanced Calculus I.  Instructor(s): extends 451. Advanced Calculus I.  Section 001.  Instructor(s): Peter L Duren extends 454. Boundary Value Problems for Partial Differential Equations.  Section 001.MATH 454. Boundary Value Problems for Partial Differential Equations.  Section 002.  Instructor(s):This course will concentrate on the applications of ordinary differential equations to physiological systems. Partial differential equations will not be covered in detail. Thus, a course in ODEs such as 216 or 316 will be sufficient preparation for this course.  Who could take the course? Basically anybody who is interested in applying mathematical methods to the biological sciences. For instance, students from Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Complex Systems, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Mathematics, Chemical Engineering, Physiology, Microbiology, and Epidemiology.  What kind of background will you need? Basically a course in differential equations, such as 216 or 316. If you have never seen a differential equation before, you may have trouble with the course. You will also need to be familiar and comfortable with computers, as a lot of the work in the course will have to be done on a computer. You will not need to be an expert in biology, as we will learn most of what we need to know as we go.  MATH 471. Introduction to Numerical Methods.  Section 001.  Instructor(s):Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted 471. Introduction to Numerical Methods.  Section 002. 481. Introduction to Mathematical Logic.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 412 or 451 or equivalent experience with abstract mathematics. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  All of modern mathematics involves logical relationships among mathematical concepts. In this course we focus on these relationships themselves rather than the ideas they relate. Inevitably this leads to a study of the (formal) languages suitable for expressing mathematical ideas. The explicit goal of the course is the study of propositional and first-order logic; the implicit goal is an improved understanding of the logical structure of mathematics. Students should have some previous experience with abstract mathematics and proofs, both because the course is largely concerned with theorems and proofs and because the formal logical concepts will be much more meaningful to a student who has already encountered these concepts informally. No previous course in logic is prerequisite. In the first third of the course the notion of a formal language is introduced and propositional connectives (and, or, not, implies), tautologies, and tautological consequence are studied. The heart of the course is the study of first-order predicate languages and their models. The new elements here are quantifiers ('there exists' and 'for all'). The study of the notions of truth, logical consequence, and provability lead to the completeness and compactness theorems. The final topics include some applications of these theorems, usually including non-standard analysis. MATH 681, the graduate introductory logic course, also has no specific logic prerequisite but does presuppose a much higher general level of mathematical sophistication. PHIL 414 may cover much of the same material with a less mathematical orientation. MATH 481 is not explicitly prerequisite for any later course, but the ideas developed have application to every branch of mathematics.  MATH 485. Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers and Supervisors.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: One year of high school algebra. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 385. May not be included in a concentration plan in mathematics.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submittedThis is an elective course for elementary teaching certificate candidates that extends and deepens the coverage of mathematics begun in the required two-course sequence MATH 385-489. Topics are chosen from geometry and algebra.  MATH 501. Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics Student Seminar.  Instructor(s):  Prerequisites & Distribution: At least two 300 or above level math courses, and graduate standing; Qualified undergraduates with permission of instructor only. (1). (Excl). (BS). May be repeated for credit for a maximum of 6 credits. Offered mandatory credit/no credit.  Credits: (1).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  The Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics (AIM) student seminar is an introductory and survey course in the methods and applications of modern mathematics in the natural, social, and engineering sciences. Students will attend the weekly AIM Research Seminar where topics of current interest are presented by active researchers (both from U-M and from elsewhere). The other central aspect of the course will be a seminar to prepare students with appropriate introductory background material. The seminar will also focus on effective communication methods for interdisciplinary research. MATH 501 is primarily intended for graduate students in the Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics M.S. and Ph.D. programs. It is also intended for mathematically curious graduate students from other areas. Qualified undergraduates are welcome to elect the course with the instructor's permission.  Student attendance and participation at all seminar sessions is required. Students will develop and make a short presentation on some aspect of applied and interdisciplinary mathematics.  MATH 513. Introduction to Linear Algebra.  Section 001.  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 412. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. Two credits granted to those who have completed MATH 214, 217, 417, or 419.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This is an introduction to the theory of abstract vector spaces and linear transformations. The emphasis is on concepts and proofs with some calculations to illustrate the theory. For students with only the minimal prerequisite, this is a demanding course; at least one additional proof-oriented course e.g., MATH 451 or 512) is recommended. Topics are selected from: vector spaces over arbitrary fields (including finite fields); linear transformations, bases, and matrices; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; applications to linear and linear differential equations; bilinear and quadratic forms; spectral theorem; Jordan Canonical Form. MATH 419 covers much of the same material using the same text, but there is more stress on computation and applications. MATH 217 is similarly proof-oriented but significantly less demanding than MATH 513. MATH 417 is much less abstract and more concerned with applications. The natural sequel to MATH 513 is MATH 593. MATH 513 is also prerequisite to several other courses (MATH 537, 551, 571, and 575) and may always be substituted for MATH 417 or 419.  Student Body: a mix of math and computer science undergrads and non-math majors  Background and Goals: This is an introduction to the theory of abstract vector spaces and linear transformations. The emphasis is on concepts and proofs with some calculations to illustrate the theory.  Alternatives: MATH 419 (Lin. Spaces and Matrix Thy) covers much of the same material using the same text, but there is more stress on computation and applications. MATH 217 (Linear Algebra) is similarly proof-oriented but significantly less demanding than MATH 513. MATH 417 (Matrix Algebra I) is much less abstract and more concerned with applications.  Subsequent Courses: The natural sequel to MATH 513 is MATH 593 (Algebra I). MATH 513 is also prerequisite to several other courses: MATH 537, 551, 571, and 575, and may always be substituted for MATH 417 or 419.  MATH 520. Life Contingencies I.  Section 001.  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 424 and 425. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  The goal of this course is to teach the basic actuarial theory of mathematical models for financial uncertainties, mainly the time of death. In addition to actuarial students, this course is appropriate for anyone interested in mathematical modeling outside of the physical sciences. Concepts and calculation are emphasized over proof. The main topics are the development of (1) probability distributions for the future lifetime random variable, (2) probabilistic methods for financial payments depending on death or survival, and (3) mathematical models of actuarial reserving. MATH 523 is a complementary course covering the application of stochastic process models. MATH 520 is prerequisite to all succeeding actuarial courses. MATH 521 extends the single decrement and single life ideas of 520 to multi-decrement and multiple-life applications directly related to life insurance and pensions. The sequence MATH 520-521 covers the Part 4A examination of the Casualty Actuarial Society and covers the syllabus of the Course 150 examination of the Society of Actuaries. MATH 522 applies the models of MATH 520 to funding concepts of retirement benefits such as social insurance, private pensions, retiree medical costs, etc.  MATH 523. Risk Theory.  Instructor(s):  Risk management is of major concern to all financial institutions and is an active area of modern finance. This course is relevant for students with interests in finance, risk management, or insurance and provides background for the professional examinations in Risk Theory offered by the Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuary Society. Students should have a basic knowledge of common probability distributions (Poisson, exponential, gamma, binomial, etc.) and have at least junior standing. Two major problems will be considered: (1) modeling of payouts of a financial intermediary when the amount and timing vary stochastically over time; and (2) modeling of the ongoing solvency of a financial intermediary subject to stochastically varying capital flow. These topics will be treated historically beginning with classical approaches and proceeding to more dynamic models. Connections with ordinary and partial differential equations will be emphasized. Classical approaches to risk including the insurance principle and the risk-reward tradeoff. Review of probability. Bachelier and Lundberg models of investment and loss aggregation. Fallacy of time diversification and its generalizations. Geometric Brownian motion and the compound Poisson process. Modeling of individual losses which arise in a loss aggregation process. Distributions for modeling size loss, statistical techniques for fitting data, and credibility. Economic rationale for insurance, problems of adverse selection and moral hazard, and utility theory. The three most significant results of modern finance: the Markowitz portfolio selection model, the capital asset pricing model of Sharpe, Lintner and Moissin, and (time permitting) the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  MATH 525 / STATS 525. Probability Theory.  Section 001.  Instructor(s): Charles R Doering  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 451 (strongly recommended) or 450. MATH 425 would be helpful. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This course is a thorough and fairly rigorous study of the mathematical theory of probability. There is substantial overlap with MATH 425, but here more sophisticated mathematical tools are used and there is greater emphasis on proofs of major results. MATH 451 is preferable to MATH 450 as preparation, but either is acceptable. Topics include the basic results and methods of both discrete and continuous probability theory. Different instructors will vary the emphasis between these two theories. EECS 501 also covers some of the same material at a lower level of mathematical rigor. MATH 425 is a course for students with substantially weaker background and ability. MATH 526, STATS 426, and the sequence STATS 510-511 are natural sequels.  Background and Goals: This course in intended for students with a strong background in topology, linear algebra, and multivariable advanced calculus equivalent to the courses MATH 513 and MATH 590. Its goal is to introduce the basic concepts and results of differential topology and differential geometry. Content: Manifolds, vector fields and flows, differential forms, Stokes' theorem, Lie group basics, Riemannian metrics, Levi-Civita connection, geodesics Alternatives: MATH 433 (Intro to Differential Geometry) is an undergraduate version which covers less material in a less sophisticated way. Subsequent Courses: MATH 635 (Differential Geometry)  This course is an introduction to the theory of complex valued functions of a complex variable with substantial attention to applications in science and engineering. Concepts, calculations, and the ability to apply principles to physical problems are emphasized over proofs, but arguments are rigorous. The prerequisite of a course in advanced calculus is essential. Differentiation and integration of complex valued functions of a complex variable, series, mappings, residues, and applications. Evaluation of improper real integrals and fluid dynamics. MATH 596 covers all of the theoretical material of MATH 555 and usually more at a higher level and with emphasis on proofs rather than applications. MATH 555 is prerequisite to many advanced courses in science and engineering fields.  MATH 556. Methods of Applied Mathematics I.  Section 001.  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 217, 419, or 513; 451 and 555. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.  Credits: (3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  This is an introduction to analytical methods for initial value problems and boundary value problems. This course should be useful to students in mathematics, physics, and engineering. We will begin with systems of ordinary differential equations. Next, we will study Fourier Series, Sturm-Liouville problems, and eigenfunction expansions. We will then move on to the Fourier Transform, Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, inversion formula, the uncertainty principle and the sampling theorem. Next we will cover distributions, weak convergence, Fourier transforms of tempered distributions, weak solution of differential equations and Green's functions. We will study these topics within the context of the heat equation, wave equation, Schrödinger's equation, and Laplace's equation.  The syllabus will describe this more thoroughly, but this course is designed primarily for students in math, computer science, and related fields. The first half of the course is on graph theory and some complexity theory, while the second half deals with some major topics from algebraic and geometric combinatorics: partially ordered sets, simplicial complexes as they arise in combinatorics, and matroids. In the course of examining these topics, we also will briefly discuss and use a few of the major techniques from enumerative combinatorics, namely bijective proofs, generating functions and inclusion-exclusion via Möbius functions. The second half of the course will not follow the textbook quite as closely as the first half.  MATH 575. Introduction to Theory of Numbers I.  Section 001 — [3 credits].  Instructor(s): Kannan Soundararajan  Prerequisites & Distribution: MATH 451 and 513. (1, 3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. Students with credit for MATH 475 can elect MATH 575 for 1 credit.  Credits: (1, 3).  Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  Many of the results of algebra and analysis were invented to solve problems in number theory. This field has long been admired for its beauty and elegance and recently has turned out to be extremely applicable to coding problems. This course is a survey of the basic techniques and results of elementary number theory. Students should have significant experience in writing proofs at the level of MATH 451 and should have a basic understanding of groups, rings, and fields, at least at the level of MATH 412 and preferably MATH 512. Proofs are emphasized, but they are often pleasantly short. A computational laboratory (MATH 476, 1 credit) will usually be offered as a supplement to this course. Standard topics which are usually covered include the Euclidean algorithm, primes and unique factorization, congruences, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Diophantine equations, primitive roots, quadratic reciprocity and quadratic fields, application of these ideas to the solution of classical problems such as Fermat's last 'theorem'. Other topics will depend on the instructor and may include continued fractions, p-adic numbers, elliptic curves, Diophantine approximation, fast multiplication and factorization, Public Key Cryptography, and transcendence. MATH 475 is a non-Honors version of MATH 575 which puts much more emphasis on computation and less on proof. Only the standard topics above are covered, the pace is slower, and the exercises are easier. All of the advanced number theory courses (MATH 675, 676, 677, 678, and 679) presuppose the material of MATH 575. Each of these is devoted to a special subarea of number theory.  MATH 590. Introduction to Topology.  Section 001.  Instructor(s): Arthur G Wasserman  Background and Goals: Math 590 is an introduction to point set topology. It is quite theoretical and requires extensive construction of proofs. Content: Topological and metric spaces, continuous functions, homeomorphism, compactness and connectedness, covering spaces and other topics. Text: Topology, Second Edition, by Munkres, Prentice Hall The course will cover (most of) chapters 2 through 6 of the text. Grades will be based on weekly individual homework assignments, class participation, two tests and the final exam.  MATH 591. General and Differential Topology.  Section 001.  Prerequisites: Math 451 or the equivalent is a prerequisite. In addition, we will assume a knowledge of Chapter 1 of Munkres' book. Students may wish to go over this chapter before the course. This course will be a introduction to general topology and differential topology. We will spend roughly half of the semester on each of these topics. Math 591 is the first part of a two-semester sequence in topology, the sequel being Math 592. The course will be a preparation for part of the topology QR exams. Students who already have a good background in general and differential topology should consider taking Math 537 instead. We'll cover: Topological Spaces and Continuous Functions Quotient Topologies Connectedness and Local Connectedness Compactness and Local Compactness Countability and Separation Axioms Urysohn's Lemma Tychonoff's Theorem Complete Metric Spaces Manifolds and Smooth Maps Derivatives and Tangents Immersions and Submersions Transversality Homework assignments will be given periodically. There will also be a midterm exam and a final exam. Text : Topology, a First Course by James Munkres, Prentice-Hall and Differential Topology by Victor Guillemin and Alan Pollack, Prentice-Hall. We will cover roughly Chapters 2-4 of Munkres' book, parts of Chapters 5 and 7, and Chapter 1 of Guillemin and Pollack.

__label__0 Specification  Aims  To introduce students to the basic notions of affine and projective algebraic geometry.  Brief Description of the unit  Algebraic geometry studies objects called varieties defined by polynomial equations. A very simple example is the hyperbola defined by the equation xy = 1 in the plane. There is a way of associating rings to varieties, and then the geometric properties can be studied using algebra, for example points correspond to maximal ideals, or the geometry of the variety can give information about certain algebraic properties of the ring. Algebraic geometry originated in nineteenth century Italy, but it is still a very active area of research. It has close connections with algebra, number theory, topology, differential geometry and complex analysis.  Learning Outcomes  Successful students will  understand the correspondences between algebraic varieties, ideals and co-ordinate rings both in the affine and projective cases,  be able to calculate the singular points and the dimension of algebraic varieties,  be able to carry out calculations on elliptic curves.  Future topics requiring this course unit  Syllabus  Affine and projective spaces.  Affine and projective varieties.  Co-ordinate rings.  Function fields.  Morphisms and rational maps.  Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.  The classification of curves.  The group law on the points of an elliptic curve.  Textbooks  Miles Reid, Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry, CUP.  Teaching and learning methods  Two lectures per week plus one weekly examples class. In addition students should expect to do at least four hours private study each week for this course unit.

Each problem is clearly solved with step-by-step detailed solutions.  Customer Reviews:  Excellent  By Robert T Carroll - September 16, 2003  I was recently offered a high school teaching job, so I needed to brush up on my calc, and this book did the trick. Unlike other books, this one "teaches by example". I always found that too many college professors & textbooks spend too much time trying to "explain" the concept. My experience has been to skip the lecture part, do the problems, and in doing so, the concept will come to you. The fact that the problems are all solved in detail is also a plus. A lot of texts simply list the answer to the problem, so you're often left wondering how they got it. This won't be an issue with this text.  This is exactly what the title says  By ophelia99 - January 3, 2005  Even if you understand the principles, the handful of problems in the average textbook are too few to really drill you on the procedures. It's a little like the difference between understanding some music theory and being able to play an instrument. Practice, for those of us who are not math prodigies, is essential. If you are willing to put in the hours and hours, this hugh collection of solved problems is well worth the price.  Step by Step  By Ivan J. Villescas "randomivan" - January 8, 2004  I have been out of college for 7 years. I began Grad school last quarter. This book gave me the basic steps to relearn and remember Calculus. It takes you through each kind of problem without skipping steps or assuming you already know what you are doing. A big crutch for understanding single and multivariable calculus. -I passed the placement exam and then used the book to assist in other engineering classes.

__label__0 "102 Combinatorial Problems" consists of carefully selected problems that have been used in the training and testing of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team. Key features: * Provides in-depth enrichment in the important areas of combinatorics by reorganizing and enhancing problem-solving tactics and strategies * Topics include: combinatorial arguments and identities, generating functions, graph theory, recursive relations, sums and products, probability, number theory, polynomials, theory of equations, complex numbers in geometry, algorithmic proofs, combinatorial and advanced geometry, functional equations and classical inequalities The book is systematically organized, gradually building combinatorial skills and techniques and broadening the student's view of mathematics. Aside from its practical use in training teachers and students engaged in mathematical competitions, it is a source of enrichment that is bound to stimulate interest in a variety of mathematical areas that are tangential to combinatorics. [via]  More editions of 102 Combinatorial Problems: From the Training of the USA Imo TeamThis book is of interest to mathematicians and computer scientists working in finite mathematics and combinatorics. It presents a breakthrough method for analyzing complex summations. Beautifully written, the book contains practical applications as well as conceptual developments that will have applications in other areas of mathematics.  From the table of contents: * Proof Machines * Tightening the Target * The Hypergeometric Database * The Five Basic Algorithms: Sister Celine's Method, Gosper&'s Algorithm, Zeilberger's Algorithm, The WZ Phenomenon, Algorithm Hyper * Epilogue: An Operator Algebra Viewpoint * The WWW Sites and the Software (Maple and Mathematica) Each chapter contains an introduction to the subject and ends with a set of exercises. [via]  The format of this book is unique in that it combines features of a traditional text with those of a problem book. The material is presented through a series of problems, about 250 in all, with connecting text; this is supplemented by a further 250 problems suitable for homework assignment. The problems are structured in order to introduce concepts in a logical order, and in a thought-provoking way. The first four sections of the book deal with basic combinatorial entities; the last four cover special counting methods. Many applications to probability are included along the way. Students from a wide range of backgrounds, mathematics, computer science or engineering will appreciate this appealing introduction. [via]  As linear orders, as elements of the symmetric group, modeled by matrices, modeled by graphs&permutations are omnipresent in modern combinatorics. They are omnipresent but also multifaceted, and while several excellent books explore particular aspects of the subject, no one book has covered them all. Even the classic results are scattered in various resources.  Combinatorics of Permutations offers the first comprehensive, up to date treatment of both enumerative and extremal combinatorics and looks at permutation as linear orders and as elements of the symmetric group. The author devotes two full chapters to the young but active area of pattern avoidance. He explores the quest for the Stanley-Wilf conjecture and includes the recent and spectacular Marcus-Tardos proof of this problem. He examines random permutations and Standard Young Tableaux and provides an overview of the very rich algebraic combinatorics of permutations. The final chapter takes an in-depth look at combinatorial sorting algorithms.  The author's style is relaxed, entertaining, and clearly reflects his enthusiasm for the "serious fun" the subject holds. Filled with applications from a variety of fields and exercises that draw upon recent research results, this book serves equally well as a graduate-level text and a reference for combinatorics researchersThe book presents the solutions to two problems: the first is the construction of expanding graphs graphs which are of fundamental importance for communication networks and computer science; the second is the Ruziewicz problem concerning the finitely additive invariant measures on spheres. Both problems were partially solved using the Kazhdan property (T) from representation theory of semi-simple Lie groups. Later, complete soultions were obtained for both problems using the Ramanujan conjecture from analytic number theory. The author, who played an important role in these developments, explains the two problems and their solutions from a perspective which reveals why all these seemingly unrelated topics are so interconnected. The unified approach shows interrelations between different branches of mathematics such as graph theory, measure theory, Riemannian geometry, discrete subgroups of Lie groups, representation theory and analytic number theory.  Special efforts were made to make the book accessible to graduate students in mathematics and computer science. A number of problems and suggestions for further research are presented.  Reviews:  "This exciting book marks the genesis of a new field. It is a field in which one passes back and forth at will through the looking glass dividing the discrete from the continuous. (...) The book is a charming combination of topics from group theory (finite and infinite), combinatorics, number theory, harmonic analysis." - Zentralblatt MATH  "The Appendix, written by J. Rogawski, explains the Jacquet-Langlands theory and indicates Delignes proof of the Petersson-Ramanujan conjecture. It would merit its own review. (...) In conclusion, this is a wonderful way of transmitting recent mathematical research directly "from the producer to the consumer." - MathSciNet  "The book is accessible to mature graduate students in mathematics and theoretical computer science. It is a nice presentation of a gem at the border of analysis, geometry, algebra and combinatorics.

It offers a thoroughly revised and updated chapter on graph minors, which now includes full new proofs of two of the central Robertson-Seymour theorems (as well as a detailed sketch of the entire proof of their celebrated Graph Minor Theorem). Second, there is now a section of hints for all the exercises, to enhance their value for both individual study and classroom use andThe importance of discrete mathematics has increased dramatically within the last few years but until now, it has been difficult-if not impossible-to find a single reference book that effectively covers the subject. To fill that void, The Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics presents a comprehensive collection of ready reference material for all of the important areas of discrete mathematics, including those essential to its applications in computer science and engineering. Its topics include:  Logic and foundations  Counting  Number theory  Abstract and linear algebra  Probability  Graph theory  Networks and optimization  Cryptography and coding  Combinatorial designs The author presents the material in a simple, uniform way, and emphasizes what is useful and practical. For easy reference, he incorporates into the text:  Many glossaries of important terms  Lists of important theorems and formulas  Numerous examples that illustrate terms and concepts  Helpful descriptions of algorithms  Summary tables  Citations of Web pages that supplement the text If you have ever had to find information from discrete mathematics in your work-or just out of curiosity-you probably had to search through a variety of books to find it. Never again. The Handbook of Discrete Mathematics is now available and has virtually everything you need-everything important to both theory and practice.  Jacob E. Goodman, co-founder and editor of Discrete & Computational Geometry, the preeminent journal on this area in the international mathematics and computer science community, joins forces with the distinguished computer scientist Joseph O'Rourke and other well-known authorities to produce the definitive handbook on these two interrelated fields.  Over the past decade or so, researchers and professionals in discrete geometry and the newer field of computational geometry have developed a highly productive collaborative relationship, where each area benefits from the methods and insights of the other. At the same time that discrete and computational geometry are becoming more closely identified, applications of the results of this work are being used in an increasing number of widely differing areas, from computer graphics and linear programming to manufacturing and robotics. The authors have answered the need for a comprehensive handbook for workers in these and related fields, and for other users of the body of results.  While much information can be found on discrete and computational geometry, it is scattered among many sources, and individual books and articles are often narrowly focused. Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry brings together, for the first time, all of the major results in both these fields into one volume. Thousands of results - theorems, algorithms, and tables - throughout the volume definitively cover the field, while numerous applications from many different fields demonstrate practical usage. The material is presented clearly enough to assist the novice, but in enough depth to appeal to the specialist. Every technical term is clearly defined in an easy-to-use glossary. Over 200 figures illustrate the concepts presented and provide supporting examples. Information on current geometric software - what it does, how efficiently it does it, and where to find it - is also included. [via]  The last ten years have seen a number of significant advances in Hopf algebras. The best known is the introduction of quantum groups, which are Hopf algebras that arose in mathematical physics and now have connections to many areas of mathematics. In addition, several conjectures of Kaplansky have been solved, the most striking of which is a kind of Lagrange's theorem for Hopf algebras. Work on actions of Hopf algebras has unified earlier results on group actions, actions of Lie algebras, and graded algebras. This book brings together many of these recent developments from the viewpoint of the algebraic structure of Hopf algebras and their actions and coactions. Quantum groups are treated as an important example, rather than as an end in themselves. The two introductory chapters review definitions and basic facts; otherwise, most of the material has not previously appeared in book form. Providing an accessible introduction to Hopf algebras, this book would make an excellent graduate textbook for a course in Hopf algebras or an introduction to quantum groups. [via]  Flexibly designed for CS students needing math review. Also covers some advanced, cutting edge topics (running 120 pages and intended for grad students) in the last chapter (8). This text fits senior year or intro. grad course for CS and math majors. [via]  This book fills a need for a thorough introduction to graph theory that features both the understanding and writing of proofs about graphs. Verification that algorithms work is emphasized more than their complexity. An effective use of examples, and huge number of interesting exercises, demonstrate the topics of trees and distance, matchings and factors, connectivity and paths, graph coloring, edges and cycles, and planar graphs. For those who need to learn to make coherent arguments in the fields of mathematics and computer science.  Introductory Combinatorics emphasizes combinatorial ideas, including the pigeon-hole principle, counting techniques, permutations and combinations, Polya counting, binomial coefficients, inclusion-exclusion principle, generating functions and recurrence relations, and combinatortial structures (matchings, designs, graphs). Written to be entertaining and readable, this book's lively style reflects the author's joy for teaching the subject. It presents an excellent treatment of Polya's Counting Theorem that doesn't assume the student is familiar with group theory. It also includes problems that offer good practice of the principles it presents. The third edition of Introductory Combinatorics has been updated to include new material on partially ordered sets, Dilworth's Theorem, partitions of integers and generating functions. In addition, the chapters on graph theory have been completely revised. A valuable book for any reader interested in learning more about combinatorics. [via]  The algorithms in this text have been rewritten in a language-neutral pseudocode making the book useful to computer science students. Each chapter begins with a "motivating problem" which occurs later as an exercise. Tables and bullet notes have been added througout, with examples.

Moreover, the book contains over 600 well thought-out exercises: although some are straightforward, most are substantial, and some will stretch even the most able reader. [via]  The it reflects the current state of the subject and emphasizes connections with other branches of pure mathematics. The volume grew out of the author's earlier book, Graph Theory -- An Introductory Course, but its length is well over twice that of its predecessor, allowing it to reveal many exciting new developments in the subject. Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, the book contains extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest. In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory such as coloring, matching, extremal theory, and algebraic graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemer\'edi's Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelah's extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. In no other branch of mathematics is it as vital to tackle and solve challenging exercises in order to master the subject. To this end, the book contains an unusually large number of well thought-out exercises: over 600 in total. Although some are straightforward, most of them are substantial, and others will stretch even the most able reader. [via] [via]  The (mathematical) heroes of this book are "perfect proofs": brilliant ideas, clever connections and wonderful observations that bring new insight and surprising perspectives on basic and challenging problems from Number Theory, Geometry, Analysis, Combinatorics, and Graph Theory.

LMS Newsletter, January 1999  This third edition offers two new chapters, on partition identities, and on card shuffling. Three proofs of Euler's most famous infinite series appear in a separate chapter. There is also a number of other improvements, such as an exciting new way to "enumerate the rationals".  The book uses the appealing theory of stable marriage to introduce and illustrate a variety of important concepts and techniques of computer science and mathematics: data structures, control structures, combinatorics, probability, analysis, algebra, and especially the analysis of algorithms.  The presentation is elementary, and the topics are interesting to nonspecialists. The theory is quite beautiful and developing rapidly. Exercises with answers, an annotated bibliography, and research problems are included. The text would be appropriate as supplementary reading for undergraduate research seminars or courses in algorithmic analysis and for graduate courses in combinatorial algorithms, operations research, economics, or analysis of algorithms.

__label__0 Algebra (elementary mathematics)  The elementary algebra east is a branch of the Mathématiques whose object is the study of the laws which govern the numerical quantities. The qualifier of elementary appears at the same time as the modern algebra in order to differentiate it from this one. Today, it is the first approach of the algebra in the school course.  The algebra is different from the arithmetic by the introduction of letters (a, b, c,…, x, y, z,…, \ alpha, \ beta, \ gamma,…) indifferently representing all the numbers and to which are applied same the rules of calculations that if it were about numbers.  It is thus possible to establish laws depending only on the nature of the operations, independently of the numbers.  The resolutions of equations and inequations, the study of the polynomials are applications of the algebra.  Algebraical expressions  An algebraical expression consists of numbers, letters and operational signs:

__label__0 About Me  Wednesday, August 31, 2011  Most math text books have examples that are completely worked out with the solution given. Take a piece of paper and hide the textbook answer and work, but show the question. Redo the problem and then check your work with their work and solution.  2. Study for Tests and Quizzes.  It is easy to just do the review homework and feel like you are ready for the test. You need to do this and more. Study for the test or quiz by going back through problems that have been given and solved in class. Actually redo them and check your work. Studying for math is DOING the MATH.  3. Make sure your homework is correct.  Check your answers with those that are in the back of the book while you are doing your assignment.  4. Do math EVERYDAY.  Do your homework every day. Try not to skip any days of homework. If you are cramming all your work into a short single session you will find this usually ends up in frustration as well as poor long term memory with the topic.  5. Attempt the most difficult questions.  The most difficult questions will usually teach you the most about the material. Never skip them. Try to get the most exposure to these problems as you can. Try to solve them on your own. Revisit them. Go in for help. Ask a question on the problems in class.  6. Take a break.  Give yourself a break when working with math. If you are being efficient, then three fifteen minute sessions in a day are better than one 45 minute session. Stand up. Stretch. Go for a walk. Move your work to a new place. A break is needed when working with math.  7. Have a good attitude.  Never think "I'm terrible at math". You usually meet your own expectations. Believe that you can do it!  8. Go in for help with your teacher and bring a specific question.  When you bring in a specific question to your math teacher they can help you with where you are struggling. The teacher then can typically give you more examples that are similar to what you are struggling with.  9. 5 minutes.  Once your homework is done, then take an extra 5 minutes to look at these possible things: vocabulary, formulas, notes, projects, and book examples.  Wednesday, August 24, 2011  Yesterday I made a math problem so that it took up one whole page of typing paper. I cut it up into 6 equal pieces that were approximately 3 by 3 inches. I put it a random order and put a paper clip on it. I did this for 5 problems in all and 2 sets of each for a total of 10 questions. I have 20 students in my class. So I had my students work in pairs. It is real easy to cut these problems up with a paper cutter. See the above cut out lines that I took with the problem.  Then I put the 5 stations with 2 sets of the same problem around the room. Four people, or two pairs of partners would be at each station. I would then have them start on the problem and set the timer for ONE MINUTE. The partners together would have to unscramble the pieces and then solve the problem. They would write their answer down on their paper. Once they were done, they could check the answer that is provided at each station. After the minute was over and students had checked their answers, I told them to rotate. They went to the next station and we did the process all over again.  I was happy with the outcome because they seemed to enjoy trying to figure out the puzzle and do the math. It also helps the students to MOVE and LEARN. They are moving after each problem.
__label__0 Algebra: A Complete Course  by VideoText Interactive  Is VideoText a Pre-Algebra course, an Algebra 1 course, an Algebra 2 course, or all of these courses?  The reason that we named our program "Algebra: A Complete Course," is that we believe the best way to learn Algebra is to start at the beginning and end at the end! In this program you will find a complete study of the essential material covered in a traditional Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 course.  However, we need to continue a little further with this answer because Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are terms that refer mostly to the traditional way that Algebra has been taught. Traditional Algebra 1 classes attempt to cover most of Algebra in the first year, but the methods that are used, and the speed with which the material is covered, hinders student understanding of the material. Instead, the student is just exposed to memorizing rules, formulas, tricks, and shortcuts. By the time they get to what is called an Algebra 2 course, (sometimes after they take a Geometry course), they have forgotten almost all of the Algebra that they memorized. So, that Algebra 2 course (which is by definition, a rehash of whatever has been called "Algebra 1"), must repeat practically all of the Algebra 1 course. In fact, it usually repeats a lot of the Pre-Algebra material as well. This is usually referred to as the "spiral method" of learning, and it is not very effective in helping students to excel, especially at this level of mathematics.  We think that this huge overlap is generally unproductive, and largely unnecessary if the concepts are taught analytically. Therefore we call our program "Algebra: A Complete Course," because we employ a mastery-learning approach, sometimes moving at a slower pace, but without the overlap. As a result, students often complete the course even more quickly.  VideoText's Algebra: A Complete Course program contains 176 video lessons contained in 10 unit directories. The program covers Pre-Algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II, and is a firm foundation for students advancing to VideoText's Geometry: A Complete Course, covering Geometry and Trigonometry.  Materials in the complete course include:  176 Video Lessons - Each of the 5-10 minute lessons explore Algebra concepts in a detailed logical order. Because no shortcuts or tricks are used, the methods are easy to follow and promote clear understanding.  360 pages of Course Notes - These notes allow students to review the logical development of a concept. Each page chronologically follows the video lesson, repeating exactly what was shown on the screen.  590 pages of Student WorkText - These pages review the concept developed in each lesson. More examples are given and exercises are provided for students. The explanations are virtually free of complicated language, making it easy for students to follow the logic of each concept.  Solutions Manuals - These manuals provide detailed, step-by-step solutions for every problem in the student WorkText. This resource is a powerful tool when used by students to complete an error-analysis of their work, and to check their thought processes.  Progress Tests - These tests, with the answer keys included, are designed to have students demonstrate understanding, lesson-by-lesson, and unit-by-unit. There are two versions of each test, allowing for retesting or review, to make sure students have mastered concepts.  The quality of mathematics is extremely important to me, as math and science go hand-in-hand. There are many students who cannot handle my chemistry course, for example, because they have not had a good algebra course. That is why I strongly encourage you to look at Videotext Interactive's algebra course. It is, truly, the best that I have seen.  The course teaches real mathematics. It does not use tricks or shortcuts. Instead, it teaches the student to think mathematically. That's what is missing from many algebra courses! The use of animation and graphics is excellent. They do not detract from the learning, as is the case with some video courses I have seen. Instead, they enhance the student's ability to understand what is happening in each and every step along the way.  If you want your student to really learn algebra, then you should use this course. In short, this course is a scientist's dream come true! Every science-oriented student should use it
__label__0 Welcome to Math 152. If you are looking for the main course website, then please go HERE. If you are looking for the Lab homepage, then you have come to the right place.  UPDATES: Hey guys, reading week is over, and hopefully you all had fun and adventures. Several people have been asking how reading week interacts with the whole "take a lab every two weeks" rule. If you are in the first batch of labs (refered to as EVEN on the timetable on this website) you will have a lab this week. If you had a lab just before reading break, then you will not have one this week.  Cheers, Alastair.  The Basics During your time in Math 152, you will be required to take part in 6 "Lab sessions" designed to help you get familiar with MATLAB- a software package designed to solve large Matrix equations. You will attend lab sessions every second week, and with each lab session you will be expected to hand in a short assignment. A TA will be at the lab to collect homework and provide assistance.  Lab times: There are 24 lab sessions, labeled L2A to L2Z. It is very important that you attend your own lab session- if everyone turned up at the time that best suited them, then some labs would be empty while others ran out of computers. Also your tutors will not accept homework handed in during the wrong lab session. Click here to find out when and where your lab is.  Lab Assignments: Each fortnight you will be expected to hand in an assignment along with your lab. You must hand in your assignment before the end of the lab session you are assigned to. These assignments will sometimes take time and experimentation, thus it is recommended that you start them before your one hour lab session (except for your first assignment). All Lab assignments will be made available early in the term, on this webpage, so you may approach them at whatever pace you wish, as long as they are finished before their hand in date. Lab 1 Lab 2 Lab 3 Lab 4 Lab 5 Lab 6  Your Lab Password: To access a computer in the lab, you will need a login ID and password. Your login ID is the first 8 characters of your first name, middle name and last name written together without any spaces and all lowercase.  Example: Your Name: John Xavier Woo Your Login: johnxavi  Your password is the character S ( uppercase required ) followed by the first seven digits of your student number.  Example: Student Number: 31415926 Password: S3141592  If your login does not work, it may be because another student's name generates the same login as yours. If this happens, talk to your TA to get your correct login details.  Your TA's Your lab TA is there to help you explore the Matlab software, and help with both technical and conceptual issues (IE, if either you or the computer is confused, your tutor is there to help.) A List of TA emails will soon be avaliable on this site, possibly with a brief description.  Name: Alastair Jamieson-Lane Email: aja107@math.ubc.ca Description: Hey Team- I'm the head Lab T.A. for this course. That's a fancy title which means I end up doing more paperwork, and odd jobs around here (such as scratching together this webpage). I'm from New Zealand and have just arrived at UBC to start my Masters in evolutionary game theory. If you have any questions which you can't take to your Lab TA for any reason, feel free to email me (or Ozgur Yilmaz if it is very serious)  Name: Bernhard Konrad Email: KonradBe@math.ubc.ca Description: Hi, I am a third year PhD student in Mathematical Biology at UBC. I use MatLab to study HIV dynamics within an infected individual, and how treatment could be improved. I look forward to seeing you in the labs.  Name: Nabil Fadai Email: nabil.t.fadai@gmail.com Description: Hi! My name's Nabil, and I'm a 4th year student in Honours Mathematics. I focus mainly on applied Mathematics, especially relating to Differential Equations. As many Differential equations are impossible to solve (exactly) by hand, it is important to use numerical approximations and computer software, such as Matlab, to make sense of these equations. I wish you all the best of luck as you begin your journey into the fascinating world of MatLab  Name: Mengdi Hua Email: huamengd@math.ubc.ca Description: Hi, I am a master student entering the 2nd semester and will be your TA for sessions L2C and L2D.

__label__0 Peltier, Doug  Calculus is a college level class, and as such, most of the emphasis will be placed on how well students do on assessments (tests and quizzes). As a result, student grades are calculated in the following manner: 10% for daily work, and 90% for assessments.  Daily work is collected at the end of every chapter on the day of the chapter test. The students are well aware of this fact, and will probably be scrambling the night before the test to finish any work that remains undone (unless they are not procrastinators, then it will already be done!).  At the bottom of the page you will find the PowerPoint lessons for this class, available usually after the day the material was presented in class, but occasionally the same day. This is the exact same presentation as was given in class, minus any bad jokes and commentary on my part.
__label__0 Math Strategies  Course Description  Math Strategies is designed to help students who struggle in math. We will concentrate on the following: Basic Skill Review – This includes computation and vocabulary Problem Solving Strategies – We will work on these both collaboratively and individually.

Enduring Understandings  Mathematics can help us make more informed decisions, work efficiently, solve problems, and appreciate its relevance in the world.  Geometric methods can help us to make connections and draw conclusions from the world in which we live.  Functions and number operations play fundamental roles in helping us to make sense of various situations.  Using prior knowledge, appropriate technology, and logical thinking, we can analyze data and effectively communicate the reasonableness of solutions.  Multiple mathematical approaches and strategies can be used to reach a desired outcome.  Algebraic models, patterns, and graphical representations are tools that can help us make meaningful connections to real-world situations.  Essential Questions:  What are the essential elements of Algebra that have grown out of the study of Pre Algebra?  How can numbers be used to make comparisons? How can mathematics help us make more informed decisions, work efficiently, and understand the world around us?
__label__0 Personal tools  Sections  Mathematica  Mathematica is a powerful, general-purpose numeric and symbolic computation tool.  Mathematica is a computer algebra system that is widely used in science, engineering, mathematics, finance, and other fields. MATLAB also has a symbolic algebra package, but Mathematica's symbolic computation facilities are more sophisticated and integrated with the rest of its features.  Mathematica has the ability to analytically and numerically solve differential equations using the DSolve and NDSolve commands. As a result, it can an indispensable tool for an instructor wanting to check or generate examples or problems.  Mathematica is not designed primarily for educational purposes, and its LISP-inspired syntax creates a steep learning curve for students and instructors alike. However, since it is widely used in academia and industry it may be beneficial for students to become familiar with its capabilities.  Instructors may find the Manipulate command in Mathematica an especially helpful tool for creating interactive tools for exploring differential equations. The Wolfram Demonstrations Project contains a large number of interactive tools built with the Manipulate (and related) commands.

__label__0 Description  This accessible text is designed to help readers help themselves to excel. The content is organized into two parts: (1) A Library of Elementary Functions (Chapters 1—2) and (2) Finite Mathematics (Chapters 3—Features  Examples are annotated and the problem-solving steps are clearly identified. This gives students extra assistance in understanding the solution.  Selected examples include steps that are usually performed mentally to provide a "basics refresher" for students who need it. (These steps are set off with dashed lines; see page 109, example 4.)  A Matched Problem follows each example, providing students with an opportunity to reinforce and test understanding before moving on.  More than 5,600 carefully selected and graded exercises are designed to help you craft the right assignments for students.  A, B, and C levels of exercises make it easy to appropriately challenge your students.  Paired exercises of the same type and difficulty level (consecutive odd and even) allow you control over student use of answers (odd answers at the back of the text).  Ample and up-to-date applications illustrate the relevance of mathematics and give students opportunities to create and interpret mathematical models.  Optional graphing-utility and spreadsheet examples and exercises are clearly identified by an icon. These provide a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and allow students to solve problems that are not feasible to solve by hand.  Explore & Discuss problems in every section encourage students to think about a relationship or process before a result is stated or to investigate additional consequences of a development in the text. These problems can help students of all levels gain better insight into the mathematical concepts and are effective in both small and large classroom settings.  Conceptual Insight boxes, appearing in nearly every section, make explicit connections to previously learned concepts, helping students place this new information in context.

Marvin's adventures in probability are one of the fifty intriguing puzzles that illustrate both elementary ad advanced aspects of probability, each problem designed to challenge the mathematically inclined. From "The Flippant Juror" and "The Prisoner's Dilemma" to "The Cliffhanger" and "The Clumsy Chemist," they provide an ideal supplement for all who enjoy the stimulating fun of mathematics. Professor Frederick Mosteller, who teaches statistics at Harvard University, has chosen the problems for originality, general interest, or because they demonstrate valuable techniques. In addition, the problems are graded as to difficulty and many have considerable stature. Indeed, one has "enlivened the research lives of many excellent mathematicians." Detailed solutions are included. There is every probability you'll need at least a few of them.  Bonus Editorial Feature:  Frederick Mosteller (1916–2006) founded Harvard University's Department of Statistics and served as its first chairman from 1957 until 1969 and again for several years in the 1970s. He was the author or co-author of more than 350 scholarly papers and more than 50 books, including one of the most popular books in his field, first published in 1965 and reprinted by Dover in 1987, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions.  Mosteller's work was wide-ranging: He used statistical analysis of written works to prove that James Madison was the author of several of the Federalist papers whose authorship was in dispute. With then–Harvard professor and later Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, he studied what would be the most effective way of helping students from impoverished families do better in school — their answer: to improve income levels rather than to simply spend on schools. Later, his analysis of the importance to learning of smaller class sizes buttressed the Clinton Administration's initiative to hire 100,000 teachers. And, as far back as the 1940s, Mosteller composed an early statistical analysis of baseball: After his team, the Boston Red Sox, lost the 1946 World Series, he demonstrated that luck plays an enhanced role in a short series, even for a strong team. In the Author's Own Words: "Though we often hear that data can speak for themselves, their voices can be soft and sly." — Frederick Mosteller
__label__0 What Kind of Problems Might I Work On?  While they may differ widely by discipline and job title, one thing remains constant among careers in mathematics—problem solving. Some potential problems that someone with mathematical training might encounter are briefly discussed below. It may be useful to note which of them you find most intriguing, and why.  How can an airline use smarter scheduling to reduce costs of aircraft parking and engine maintenance?  How can one design a detailed plan for a clinical trial? Building such a plan requires advanced statistical skills and sophisticated knowledge of the design of experiments.  Is ethanol a viable solution for the world's dependence on fossil fuels? Can biofuel production be optimized to combat negative implications on the world's economy and environment?  How can automotive systems become more efficient and reduce emissions as mandated by U.S. public policy?  How do we use major advances in computing power to incorporate knowledge about interactions between the oceans, the atmosphere and living ecosystems into models used to predict long-term change?  How can automotive and aircraft companies test performance, safety, and ergonomics, while at the same time lowering the cost of construction and testing prototypes?  A pharmaceutical company wants to search a very large database of proteins to find one that is similar in shape or activity to one they have discovered. What's the most efficient way to do so?  How might disease spread in populated areas in the event of a bioterrorism incident, and how would it be contained?  How do you design a robotic hand to grip a coin and drop it in a slot?  How can you mathematically model the spread of a forest fire depending on weather, ground cover and type of trees?  How can you allocate an investment among various financial instruments to meet a risk/reward trade-off?  Since a chemical company cannot test potential new products by releasing them into the atmosphere, it must develop models of atmospheric chemistry that simulate the complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Can computational simulations show sufficient detail to capture the effects of the chemicals, but still be fast enough to permit studies of many different chemicals?  How can genome sequencing analysis help in making clinical decisions based on a personalized medicine approach?  Recommendation algorithms provide users of e-commerce systems with unique ratings and recommendations of items and products based on their past purchases, behavior and interests. How can mathematics improve rating prediction performance and help enhance the consumer experience?  Part of the preparation for your future is obtaining a solid foundation in mathematical and computational knowledge—tools like differential equations, probability, combinatorics, applied algebra, and matrices, as well as the art of abstraction and advanced computing and programming skills. Preparation for a career in applied mathematics and computational science also involves being able to apply these skills to real-life problems, and achieving practical results. Mathematical and computational skills are a huge career asset that can set you apart and open doors.
__label__0 Mathematics Programs  K-8 Mathematics Programs:  Connected Math Project 2 (CMP2) and Gomath and Glencoe Math  High School Mathematics Text Books:  Foerster Algebra I & II and Jurgenson Geometry  Read below for detailed information about these district programs, district mathematics partnerships, and curriculum maps.  Holyoke Public Schools Math Programs  Connected Math Project 2 (CMP2) is a researched based program that is being used for middle school mathematics instruction. The overarching goal of the program is that all students be able to reason and communicate proficiently in mathematics. CMP helps students develop an understanding of important concepts, skills, procedures, and ways of thinking and reasoning in number sense, measurement, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics. The concepts are embedded in engaging problems that students explore individually, in a small group, or with a whole class. The problems presented over time give student practice with important concepts, related skills, and algorithms. A three-phased workshop model that support s problem centered instruction is used to deliver the curriculum in these classes. Teachers have had opportunities for training in CMP2 made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, and CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning. The District Math Coaches and Lesley University will continue to provide teachers with training in the mathematical content and implementation of lessons.  The Math programs are implemented using the Workshop Model. This three-phase instructional workshop model used to deliver instruction in all math classrooms in grades K - 8. In the initial phase, Launch or Opening – the teacher sets the problem, introduces new ideas, clarifies definitions reviews, old concepts, and connects to past experiences without lowering the challenge of the task. During the second phase, Explore or Work Time – students work independently or in small groups to gather data, share ideas, look for patterns, and make conjectures. In the final phase Summary or Closing – the students present and discuss their solutions as well as the strategies they used as the teacher guides them to reach the mathematical goal of the class and connect their new understanding to prior knowledge. Teachers have had opportunities for training on the workshop model made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning, and Math Investigations Training from Hampshire Educational Collaborative. District Math Coaches will continue to work with teachers to enhance the implementation of the program and help to deepen the understanding and connection of the mathematical strands.  Curriculum Maps for K – 8 have been designed to ensure that students are exposed to a rigorous curriculum in every school and every grade, and to have consistent instruction and assessment district wide. The district's expectation is for students to successfully meet the Massachusetts Mathematics Standards and to score at the proficient range on the MCAS test in mathematics. In order to facilitate this, teachers are required to follow the curriculum maps. The successful implementation of these maps requires teachers to work through the project and problems prior to planning their lessons. The math coaches and other district personnel were trained in curriculum mapping by America's Choice, became the principle architects of the documents, and are now providing professional development to the grade level teachers as the first of these maps are available.

__label__0 Synopses & Reviews  Publisher Comments:  BEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.  About the Author  Mark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995. He is a full-time Associate Professor at Palomar College and has taught there for the past 9 years. He is a member of AMATYC and regularly attends the national AMATYC and ICTCM conferences. He has also done extensive reviewing and testing of various classroom technologies and materials. Through this work, he is committed to teaching his students through applications and using technology to help his students both understand the mathematics in context and communicate their results clearly. Intermediate algebra is one of his favorite courses to teach, and he continues to teach several sections of this course each year.

__label__0 Mathematics Department Handbook  Welcome to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Rochester.  We have compiled these notes in order to assist you, the first year student, in making the transition from high school to university. This is sometimes a difficult process for various reasons. As far as first year mathematics courses go, there are two main difficulties:  First, the Department of Mathematics expects students who take courses in mathematics to take the responsibility for mastering the course material. There is lots of assistance offered, all detailed in these notes, but it is your responsibility to use these resources. Second, many talented students have been able to do well in their high school math courses in spite of not having regular work habits, but now the situation is very different. It is almost impossible to pass first year university mathematics courses without developing these habits. We hope this Guide will help you learn how.  We have also included in these notes some hints on study techniques and writing examinations, expanded descriptions of first year courses, and a reading list for students interested in expanding their knowledge of mathematics in a general way.

__label__0 MATH 240  Using a calculator  Solving a system of linear equations on a computer or calculator is surprisingly difficult. Inverting a matrix or performing certain other matrix operations can lead to numerical errors that require a lot of theory to understand. Our department has an entire undergraduate course, Math 434, Numerical Linear Algebra, that covers numerical techniques in linear algebra. We do not have enough time to discuss numerical algorithms in MATH 240, and if you do not know the relevant theory, you must be very cautious and skeptical about the answer when you just press a button on your calculator.  Solving a system of equations  If you have been trained to believe that a calculator will always give you the correct answer, you may be in for a shock if you try to solve a system of equations by just plugging the coefficients into your calculator and pressing a button. Even a system of two equations in two unknowns can present problems for the program used by your calculator. Here is one example.  We will try to solve this system of equations.  416785x + 415872y = 1 415872x + 414961y = 0  The coefficients in the problem have six significant digits. Since the TI-85 calculator stores more than twice that many significant digits internally, solving the system would seem to present no problem. Using the equation solver on the TI-85 gives the following "answer".  You can "check" the calculator answer by substituting it back into the system. Be sure to use the values stored in the calculator. Then, to the limits of the calculator's accuracy, everything checks out, and, in fact, both solutions appear to be correct.  To find the exact solution, we can use elementary row operations on the system of equations. The first goal is to reduce the size of the numbers, but retain integer values. Here are the results.  This is not a problem unique to the TI-85. Using MATLAB on a SUN workstation also gives an answer that differs substantially from the correct one. The difficulties are inherent in the problem. To look at this problem from the geometric point of view, we could compute the slope of each line. To 12 decimal point accuracy, we get  416785 ÷ 415872 = -1.00219538704 415872 ÷ 414961 = -1.00219538704  To most calculators, the lines appear to be parallel, and so there should be no solution at all! Because the angle between the two lines is very small, a small change in the coefficients caused by roundoff error can make a very large difference in the solution. From a geometric point of view, shifting the two lines just a little bit can make a bit difference in the point of intersection.  Inverting a matrix  In the previous problem, we were able to find an exact inverse for the coefficient matrix.  To illustrate some of the inherent difficulties in doing Gaussian elimination using floating point arithmetic, we will look at the row reduction of a standard "badly behaved" matrix.  The matrix given below is called a Hilbert matrix. It is a well-known example of a matrix that causes problems for numerical algorithms. To help understand the problems, we will do an exact row reduction, compared to a row reduction done using floating point arithmetic. To see how the error in the approximations can be compounded, we will use a highly simplified example, in which the floating point arithmetic is carried out with accuracy to only three significant digits.  In the original matrix, labeled (1), some of the decimal entries are already inaccurate. In matrix (3), the three digit computation that produces the 3rd entry in row 4 is this:  .837×10-1 - (.904)(.830×10-1) = .837×10-1 - .750×10-1 = .870×10-2  Comparing this to the correct value of 1 ÷ 120 = .00833 (to 3 digits) shows that it has only one correct digit.  In matrix (5), the last entry of row 4 is computed as follows:  .837×10-2 - (.690)(.127×10-1) = .837×10-2 - .876×10-2 = .006×10-2  Because we have to subtract two values that are nearly equal, the answer has even less accuracy. The cumulative errors in reducing just 3 rows produce a value of -.0000600 instead of (-1) ÷ 4200 = -.000238 (to 3 digits).  The method for defining a Hilbert matrix can be extended to larger sizes, and the 10 by 10 Hilbert matrix presents substantial problems for even a very sophisticated numerical algorithm. You can experiment on your calculator, by inverting the Hilbert matrices of larger and larger sizes.

__label__0 Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) is a Web-based, artificially intelligent assessment and learning system. ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows and doesn't know in a course. ALEKS then instructs the student on the topics they are most ready to learn. As a student works through a course, ALEKS periodically reassesses the student to ensure that topics are also retained.  The Basic Algebra courses will be taught using the software ALEKS. It is possible for students to accelerate through the Basic Algebra sequence by completing the courses early and then following the change of section process. This process starts with printing the Math Emporium Course Section Change Form (See below) and going to see your current Basic Algebra instructor. Have the instructor fill out the top of the form and bring the signed form to the Math Department located in MSB 233.

__label__0 Algebra I  Grade Level: 8-12 Credit: 1.0 Prerequisite: Math 8  This course presents the basic concepts of algebra. Concepts studied include working with polynomials, solving equations, using formulas, graphing linear equations, solving linear systems, simplifying and solving quadratic expressions and equations, and working with basic functions. Problem solving and real-life applications are emphasized.
__label__0 Mathematics  The maths department see mathematics as an engaging and creative activity that develops a student's ability to not only think in an organised and logical way, but also for them to look at imaginative ways to solve problems. As such our emphasis is on students developing transferable skills that are honed using the traditional mathematics content and rigor, but with the students engaging with a more task-led curriculum, that allows them to identify the mathematics required to solve problems and gives them ample opportunity to experiment.  Key Stage 3  We have a two year Key Stage 3 where our aim is to teach the students to develop self-learning skills. This is achieved by giving the students every opportunity to develop thinking skills through themed tasks. The emphasis is not on a correct answer, but on developing a range of strategies to cope with the ever changing world of the 21st century and for these skills to be transferable. We wish to allow the students to continue to improve on their arithmetic, with an emphasis on the development of the "numerate student" who uses a variety of methods of calculation, that depends on the numbers used and the degree of accuracy required. The students also engage with geometry and algebra through tasks where "doing and applying" mathematics is not a separate part, but integral to their success. This will enable them to enter their Key Stage 4 with the skill to pursue a functional approach to their learning.  Key Stage 4  Students are entered at either Higher or Foundation Level GCSE, but the skills initiated at Key Stage 3 are further developed and the aspects of functionality and enquiry are keenly pursued, so that students can transfer their skills to new and more demanding areas of mathematics. We follow a linear course which has two terminal examinations. Students are entered for their final exam when it is appropriate, with their final opportunity to take the examinations at the end of Year 11.  Key Stage 5  We offer both Maths and Further Maths at Key Stage 5.  A Level Maths has four Pure Maths core modules: two in Year 12 and two in Year 13, supported with Statistics in Year 12 and Mechanics in Yearr 13.  If a student opts for Further Maths, this is run in conjunction with the Further Maths support network where the students have a wide choice of modules that they complete online.

__label__0 Here we present a few examples of how real benefits are achieved by rigorously applying mathematical programming and optimization on real-world problems.  Optimal Schedules  Optimization is a powerful tool for determining workable schedules that are in accordance with certain requirements. Examples include  Put together a lesson plan taking into account teacher availability and teacher preferences such as morning/afternoon sessions, preferred classes, or days without lessons. At the same time restricted lab availability is taken into account, gaps in teachers' schedules are minimized, and all required subjects are taught for each class.  Create a seminar schedule for multiple locations, topics, and audiences. The requirements to be met are instructor availability in terms of skills/topic coverage, instructor willingness to travel certain distances and to give a certain number of courses, meet customer requirements (offer specific courses within certain time periods in certain regions), and to minimize travel cost.  In a specific implementation we managed to maximize the number of offered training courses for high school teachers across three U.S. states while observing constraints such as travel restrictions, trainer skills and availability, and course demand and frequency. The computed plans do not conflict with business and trainer constraints while the effort to come up with a workable plan was reduced from three days to an hour. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and included approx. 75 locations, 100 instructors, 25 time slots, and 20 different courses. Depending on the specific constraints, the resulting schedule contains about 200-250 scheduled courses during the planning period of one quarter.  Optimize utilization of beds in a hospital depending on total number of beds, allocations to certain departments, expected duration of the individual stays in the hospital, required safety quantities, etc. The benefits of optimization include maximized utilization of available beds, minimized waiting time, minimized bottlenecks, and increased visibility into the hospital supply chain.  Other Applications  Apart from optimizing schedules there is an endless list of other applications where using applied mathematics and in particular optimization, greatly improves profitability. Beyond more common areas like route planning, location determination in a logistics network, and commission structures in a multi-level marketing environment, here are examples of successful projects we have done:  Web-based optimal chemical formulation and blending: Upon entering a set of desired chemical and physical properties of the end product on a web page the application computes the optimal chemical formulation in terms of meeting the specifications while minimizing cost and returns the result in the user's web browser. The benefits for sales and marketing include more accurate quotes within significantly shorter response times.

__label__0 Tutorial 1  Once you have access to an installation of Mathematica, you need to know how to use it.  Opening the Program  In an on-campus computer lab, go to Start Menu, then Programs, then Wolfram Mathematica. Click on the icon for Mathematica, named Spikey.  Up will pop an introductory window. On the left hand side of this button is an option to create a new Mathematica notebook or open an old one. The notebook is where all your interactions with the program will take place.  First steps with Mathematica  Open the file. The file should look like a "Powerpoint" Presentation. If it does not, go to the Format Menu and click on "Format > Screen Environment > SlideShow".  Follow this tutorial step-by-step and discuss the most interesting aspects with your neighbors.  At the end of the tutorial, you should use the remaining time to explore the power of Mathematica. I suggest looking in the Documentation Center (Help Menu) or at the Wolfram Demonstrations Project. Feel free to explore on your own or with your neighbors. If you are having trouble getting started, here is what I do when I am exploring:  I go to the Documentation Center and type in a command (such as Manipulate)  I do a quick look at the selected examples that are given and see if they are interesting.  If so, I want to see all the examples. So I select the entire notebook (Ctrl-A or Apple-A) and then open all subgroups (Cell Menu: "Grouping > Open All Subgroups").  I play around with the examples, moving sliders, changing variables to see what happens.  If I see a command I do not know, I will search for it in the Documentation Center  At the bottom of the file is a "See Also" section, which tells you similar commands.  Also at the bottom are links to more in depth tutorials, which can be useful sometimes.  Other Items of Note!  In Mathematica, it is important to distinguish between parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}:  Parentheses (): Used to group mathematical expressions, such as (3+4)/(5+7).  Brackets []: Used when calling functions, such as N[Pi].  Braces {}: Used when making lists, such as {i,1,20}.  If you use the wrong symbols in the wrong places or if you do not have a closing symbol for every opening symbol, Mathematica will give you an error.  Mathematica is Case-SenSitive (AA is not the same as aA), so be careful about what you type. Many of your initial errors will come about because of one of the two above problems.  In Mathematica, there are four types of equals: =, :=, ==, and ===. You need to understand the difference between the first two.  To define a variable to store it in memory, use =. For example, to define z to be 3, write z=3.  You use == to check for equality. For example, 1-1==0 will evaluate to True and 1==0 will evaluate to False.  You use := to define your own command. (This is advanced.)  You will likely not use === in this class.  One of the most important things to do is explore. If you are having trouble with a certain function, use the ? command to ask for help. Enter ? Table and the output will be a yellow box with a quick synopsis of the command. For more detailed information, click the blue >> at the bottom right of this yellow box. This will open the Documentation Center which gives examples of using the command in action, available options for this command, and anything else you might want to know about the command.  Algebra and Calculus  Mathematica will do everything your calculator can and more.  Use ^ to put something to a power.  pi is Pi, e is E and sqrt(-1) is I.  If you want to see the numerical approximation to a fraction or irrational number, use the function N. For example, to find the decimal represenation of pi, write N[Pi].  Use E^x or Exp[x] to represent the function ex.  To take the derivative of a function, use D and specify the derivative with respect to which variable. For instance D[x^2 + 3x, x].  To take the integral of a function, use Integrate and specify the integral with respect to which variable. For instance Integrate[x^2 + 3x, x].  To solve for the roots of ax2+bx+c=0 symbolically, use Solve[a x^2 + b x + c == 0, x]. Notice the double equals sign. (Mathematica is searching for when the expression is True.)  Coefficient[(1 + x)^10, x^3] gives the coefficient of x3 in the expansion of (1 + x)10.

__label__0 This is not a universal recipee for anything, rather a few random points.  1) Make sure your background matches the course expectations. If not, work on it before even thinking of taking an advanced class.  2) Read ahead, not behind. Most teachers will tell you what's coming next and if you come to the class knowing half the story already, you can concentrate on the other half and gain double time for absorbing it.  4) Learn each proof to the level that your professor can wake you up at midnight and you'd be ready to present it right away. Keep in mind that there are millions of theorems but only thousands of proofs, hundreds of proof blocks, and dozens of ideas. Unfortunately, no one has figured out how to transfer the ideas directly yet, so you have to extract them from complicated arguments by yourself.  5) Solve problems, solve problems, and solve problems (not the ones that ask you to do something according to the ready scheme, of course, but the ones that ask you to prove something that is not clear from the beginning). You need to learn how to create simple proofs before you can understand the complex ones.

__label__0 Because of its large command structure and intricate syntax, Mathematica can be difficult to learn. Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed. A Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations. While it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.  "This book is a comprehensive package for knowledge sharing on Mathematics. The language of the book is simple and self-explanatory, this will help the students to grasp the fundamentals of the subject easily. The book follows a to the point approach and lays stress on the understanding of the core concepts. Appropriate number of MCQs are given for each topic that are of great help to the students appearing for competitive and State Board examinations.""   " . . . [a] treasure house of material for students and teachers alike . . . can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic." --London Times Higher Education Supplement "The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking." --SIAM Review "Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards . . . to novelty . . . each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically." --Mathematical Reviews A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling provides in-depth and systematic coverage of the art and science of mathematical modelling. Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.  Most texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables. This approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data. Although the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.  The first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.  Developed from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.  Although the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented. Developed from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.  The field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.  Realizing the specific needs of first-year graduate students, this reference allows readers to grasp and master fundamental concepts in abstract algebra-establishing a clear understanding of basic linear algebra and number, group, and commutative ring theory and progressing to sophisticated discussions on Galois and Sylow theory, the structure of abelian groups, the Jordan canonical form, and linear transformations and their matrix representations.  R is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields. Doing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive. A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.  WILEY-INTERSCIENCE PAPERBACK SERIESFrom the Reviews of History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750"This is a marvelous book . . . Anyone with the slightest interest in the history of statistics, or in understanding how modern ideas have developed, will find this an invaluable resource."--Short Book Reviews of ISI  Because of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code. The book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.
__label__0 9780199602124  Free Delivery in U.K  Synopsis: : Maths for Economics  Many years of Teaching led Geoff Renshaw to develop Maths for Economics as a resource which builds your self-confidence in maths by using a gradual learning gradient and constantly reinforcing learning with examples and exercises. Some students embarking on this module feel that they have lost their confidence in maths, or perhaps never had any in the first place. The author has designed the Book so that whether you have a maths A level, GCSE, or perhaps feel that you need to go back over the very basics, Knowledge is built up in small steps, not big jumps. Once you are confident that you have firmly grasped the foundations, this book will help you to make the progression beyond the Mechanical exercises and into the development of a maths tool-kit for the analysis of economic and Business problems. This is a skill which will prove valuable for your degree and for your future employers.  Author Information  Geoff Renshaw, Department of Economics, University of Warwick  Features  * The flexible design of the contents means that this book is suitable if your starting point is maths A level, GCSE, or even if you have forgotten most of the maths you learned in school. * A gradual learning gradient underpins the text; each concept is explored comprehensively, including numerous examples and exercises at each stage to ensure that you get a really good understanding of it. * Builds self-confidence in maths through the use of step-by-step examples, progress exercises, hints and rules, encouraging you to develop a 'maths tool-kit' for analysing economics and business problems. * Any unnecessarily long explanations have been rewritten to make the exposition clearer in the appropriate places. * Material on matrix algebra, limits, and necessary and sufficient functions has been revised in line with market feedback * Answers to the progress exercises now appear at the end of the book, rather than online, for ease of use.

__label__0 Program Model C' Pacing Guide  Traditional Model for High School Mathematics  This model features a classic sequence of courses that emphasizes connections across content strands. Data analysis topics have been added to the familiar high school mathematics curriculum. Topics are grouped so that Year 1 focuses on algebra and algebraic reasoning, Year 2 focuses on geometry, and Year 3 returns to a focus on further algebraic topics leading to trigonometry and pre-calculus. This sequence works well for many students, is familiar to teachers and parents, and fits the design of many instructional materials. However, this does not mean that the status quo is working for all students. Even though course topics and sequencing may look familiar, effective strategies for presenting the material must be implemented to make this or any model curriculum successful. Students must be placed in a course for which they have the prerequisites and have adequate time and support to fully understand the material. Students must be engaged with rich problems throughout each course in order to understand the mathematics fully and develop creative problem solving and reasoning skills. Students must also be expected to communicate mathematical ideas using formal mathematical language. Teachers in schools adopting Model C will benefit from professional development that includes strategies for successfully teaching all students and that familiarizes teachers with sources of problems to deepen student understanding of mathematical topics.  This model provides students with the basic mathematical knowledge they will need for future education and employment. The design offers a progression for the development of mathematical thinking, with each course presenting the material in a logical, efficient, and systematic way. Related topics are presented together whenever possible and learning builds upon previously learned material. Connections between algebraic, numerical, and geometric representations are made throughout the model to provide a coherent curricular model.  Model C' is an adaptation of Model C that allows additional time for students who are preparing for postsecondary education in programs that do not include calculus. This adaptation prepares students for OGT requirements by the end of the second year course and meets the Ohio Board of Regents expectations for students to be prepared for a non-remedial college mathematics course by the end of the third year course.  First Year Course  First Year Course Rationale  All students require a rigorous and demanding curriculum in order to develop sound reasoning and strong problem solving skills. The topics covered in Year 1 of this model can provide this rigor. Students progress from their informal middle school experience with number relationships, data analysis, and linear equations to more formal definitions, algebraic reasoning, and graphical representations. With this model, as with any model, different students may require different amounts of time and support to become proficient with the mathematics.  First Year Course Description  The focus of this course is the development of algebraic understanding, reasoning, and skills using mathematical language to express abstract ideas. The Year 1 course has four main themes:  transition from generalized arithmetic to algebra;  data analysis and probability;  linear equations and functions;  nonlinear functions (introduction)  More specifically, students will solve linear equations and inequalities and systems of equations. They will graph a variety of functions and add the study of probability and statistics to the topics covered in a typical Algebra I course. Appropriate use of technology is encouraged to enhance the study of these topics.  Second Year Course  Second Year Course Rationale  The second year model develops formal logic and reasoning skills through the study of Euclidean geometry. Although geometry is a subject of importance and practical use, the main goal of the course is to develop students' abilities to reason and to present coherent arguments. In addition to this deep involvement with logic and deduction, students discover connections between formal geometry and the algebraic techniques learned earlier, and they learn important practical applications of geometry. With mastery of the Year 1 and Year 2 courses, students will be prepared for further mathematical education and for understanding deeper connections between abstract mathematics and real world situations.  Second Year Course Description  The course begins with polynomial and exponetial functions, with emphasis on quadratics. The focus of the course is the development of logic and reasoning, along with basic ways to think geometrically. The two foci for the Year 2 course are formal reasoning and applications of geometry (constructions, calculating lengths, areas, and volumes). Geometric constructions should be woven through the course. Appropriate use of technology is encouraged to enhance the study of these topics.  Third Year Course  Third Year Course Rationale  The Third Year course includes content that is critical for all students. The third year continues to build mathematics essential for the workplace and future education, and exposes students to a wide variety of rich mathematics. Algebraic topics are a focus and are developed in relationship to the geometry and mathematical reasoning the students have previously studied.  Third Year Course Description  Prerequisite to this course is working knowledge of key topics from years one and two, including number line and interval notation, solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities, and absolute value and distance. The thrust of the Year 3 course is to reinforce and extend the algebraic topics from Year 1 and Year 2 courses. Throughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics. Students should use graphing calculators and other technology as integral parts of the course to enhance the study of these topics.  Fourth Year Course  Fourth Year Course Rationale  With the advent of the core requirements for Ohio, all students must take mathematics inThis course presents a mix of algebraic and geometric topics that will help develop students' algebraic thinking. Throughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics. Mastery of the four courses in this model will provide students with the mathematical and reasoning skills needed to succeed in a rigorous college-level calculus course.  Fourth Year, Option 1, Course Description  The Year 4 course has several focus areas: (1) formal proofs by induction with applications, (2) modeling bivariate data, and (3) trigonometry. By studying these topics, the student will have completed a comprehensive high school curriculum. Students may use graphing calculators and other technology to enhance the study of these topics.  Fourth Year Course, Option 2 Modeling and Quantitative Reasoning  Fourth Year, Option 2, Course Rationale  One purpose of secondary education in the United States has always been preparing students for their roles as citizens, as well as preparing them for future study and the workplace. Today numbers and data are critical parts of public and private decision making. Decisions about health care, finances, science policy, and the environment are decisions that require citizens to understand information presented in numerical form, in tables, diagrams, and graphs. Students must develop skills to analyze complex issues using quantitative tools.  In addition to a textbook, teachers will want to use online resources, newspapers, and magazines to identify problems that are appropriate for the course. Students should be encouraged to find issues that can be represented in a quantitative way and shape them for investigation. Appropriate use of available technology is essential as students explore quantitative ways of representing and presenting the results of their investigations.  Fourth Year, Option 2, Course Description  This course prepares students to investigate contemporary issues mathematically and to apply the mathematics learned in earlier courses to answer questions that are relevant to their civic and personal lives. The course reinforces student understanding of:  percent  functions and their graphs  probability and statistics  multiple representations of data and data analysis  This course also introduces functions of two variables and graphs in three dimensions. The applications in all sections should provide an opportunity for deeper understanding and extension of the material from earlier courses. This course should also show the connections between different mathematics topics and between the mathematics and the areas in which applied.

__label__0 Transforming? There is a step before applying the technique of "completing the square" that is required and that is to come up with the technique of completing the square in the first place. You're not suggesting that the purpose of a course in elementary algebra is to just teach a finite set of techniques to be memorized, understood and used when appropriate, are you? Although I agree that is a subset of the purpose of an algebra class, that still leaves a lot of gaps in between those (finite number of) techniques taught in an algebra class and the only way to fill those gaps is that the student also develop the skill to invent new solutions without prior art. And some techniques, even though they are labeled "techniques" are not algorithmic or formulaic at all, such as substitution of variables or induction. Most students are poor with these because they are just a very high level form and the student must fill in the form with a solution. Call it study, call it practice, call it whatever, but there is a lot of brain work left to do even after you see that a technique works.  Bob Hansen  On Jul 18, 2012, at 3:03 PM, Louis Talman wrote:  > And, in particular, I never thought of learning to complete a square as "studying the solution of quadratic equations". I thought of it, instead, as a way of transforming an expression into an equivalent expression that was more useful in a given context.
__label__0 Improve Your Note Taking  Improving Math Skills  When studying for math, we often use exercises, worksheets and sample problems to work through in order to prepare for an upcoming test, exam or review. However, as in most other subjects, note taking and journaling is also very effective and very important to help with the understanding of specific math concepts. Whether you dictate your notes and have them available for audio, or write your notes to review them visually, the strategies and tips here will help you better prepare for math tests and exams. Effective notes will help you to remember important concepts taught in class and they will guide you through various math problems.  Taking Notes  I prefer to use the two column approach in my notes and I also prefer to use pencil. To use the two column approach, your actual notes will be on one side and the examples or theorems/forumulas will be on the other. There is usually more than one method of solving a problem, use your notes to document this. Be sure to include any examples that you believe will help you later. Math is often about making connections as so many concepts are interrelated, be sure to record the connections you make. Areas where you have concerns or believe to be your greatest weakness are also the areas you should emphasize. To emphasize, you may wish to use a highligher and attach a few stickies. Personally, I prefer to date my notes as well, sometimes I include the text pages for handy reference.  Format  I've already mentioned that it is helpful to keep audio notes, however, it is difficult to record examples of exercises in audio. Audio is better when you are reviewing postulates, procedures and formulas. The more you hear the explanations, the greater the chance you will retain the information. However, you may also wish to record your notes on your computer. I have used Microsoft One Note previously and found it quite effective. There is an add-in that allows you to perform calculations and to plot graphs and it contains an extensive collection of mathematical symbols and structures to display expressions and has a pretty good equation gallery. Two others I use are La-Tex, and Math Symbols. Although I like La Tex, it isn't my first choice for taking notes. Math Symbols is great for creating exercises and it allows you to create your equations quickly (newer version has handwriting recognition) but you'll still need another application to integrate it with. A lot of my students prefer One Note because it's where they keep all of their notes. However, everyone is different and you'll need a strategy that works best for you.  Tips for Improving Your Note Taking Skills  Listen carefully to your instructor and jot down the key points about solving problems, proving theorems or using a procedure. Write down everything you think that will help you when you return to this concept later.  Don't get too wordy, keep your notes to the point and simple to understand.  Use logical organization, jumping around from concept to concept will only be confusing. Make sure your examples have key points in your notes.  Explain your reasoning. This component is key, keep it short and sweet but explain the logic behind the application or procedure.  Record alternate methods, as I mentioned earlier, there is usually more than one way to solve a problem, be sure to record the alternative methods.  When taking notes in math, look at your textbook. What do you like about it? What don't you like about it? Think of your notes as a set of cheat notes for you to review. Make them look like a text that you find easy to follow.  In summary, most important of all is to review your notes in a timely way. Make review part of your routine. We are all guilty of cramming before tests and exams but a little review along the way will better equip you to see greater success in math. If journaling works better for you, you may wish to check out some strategies for effective math journaling.

__label__0 The School is composed by five set of lectures, designed to introduce young researchers to the more recent advances on geometric and algebraic approaches for integer programming. Each set of lectures will be about six hours long. They will provide the background, introduce the theme, describe the state-of-the-art, and suggest practical exercises. The organizers will try to provide a relaxed atmosphere with enough time for discussion.  Integer programming is a field of optimization with recognized scientific and economical relevance. The usual approach to solve integer programming problems is to use linear programming within a branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut framework, using whenever possible polyhedral results about the set of feasible solutions. Alternative algebraic and geometric approaches have recently emerged that show great promise. In particular, polynomial algorithms for solving integer programs in fixed dimension have recently been developed. This is a hot topic of international research, and the School will be an opportunity to bring up-to-date knowledge to young researchers.

__label__0 "Plateaus" to watch out for - MathOverflow most recent 30 from  to watch out forDoubleJay2009-10-25T16:43:39Z2009-10-27T23:14:33Z <p>I'm a lot earlier in my math education that most of the people on this site. Currently I'm studying computer science, and I'm interested in looking into statistical and optimization applications, as well as theory (yeah, I know that sound broad, but I'm quite early in my education!). Anyways, I want to get deep into the math behind these things - statistics, combinatorics, linear and integer programming, maybe some analysis. Algebra also interests me.</p> <p>I've found that math studies go okay, but from time to time I have trouble. Understanding delta-epsilon proofs was a big obstacle for calculus back in high school, and more recently generating functions have been giving me serious trouble.</p> <p>If I pursue a path towards graduate level studies, what sort of things should I watch out for? More generally, since I don't know where I'm going, what concepts did you find hardest to grasp during your undergrad/early graduate studies?</p> <p>Thanks.</p>  by Wlog for "Plateaus" to watch out forWlog2009-10-25T17:37:06Z2009-10-25T17:37:06Z<p>I have advice, but it is dependent on the size of your university and/or the mathematics department therein.</p> <p>A large part of my undergraduate process was to tutor others in the class. A good test of your understanding is if you assist someone else in coming to the same understanding. Unfortunately, it may be that your class sizes are <em>epsilon</em>. Thus it will be more difficult to form a study group. Applied Functional Analysis is a topic of great importance for a young computer scientist, especially one who is aspiring for a PhD, but it can be slow to grasp if you are taking it as an independent reading course.</p>  by Scott Morrison for "Plateaus" to watch out forScott Morrison2009-10-25T18:34:40Z2009-10-25T18:34:40Z<p>One general advice about early maths education is to not decide what you like too early!</p> <p>Keep learning new fields, keep reading books about things you don't know yet. Most mathematicians I know aren't working on problems they would have expected when they arrived in grad school. It takes a surprisingly long time for most people to reach the level of mathematical maturity where they're reading to work on new problems, and until you have an inkling that you're ready for this, don't overspecialise. There's plenty of time for that later!</p>  by Elisha Peterson for "Plateaus" to watch out forElisha Peterson2009-10-27T23:14:33Z2009-10-27T23:14:33Z<p>My gut response is to say there are a limitless supply of these plateaus. There is so much out there that even the best mathematicians are limited in what they can understand well. So in terms of specific concept plateaus, well if you're like most of us you'll probably have lots of them, and that's a good thing.</p> <p>In terms of concepts, I think what I found tough was often much clearer after I lost an early misconception. E.g. for a long time I thought the Killing form in Lie algebra was using "killing" as a synonym for "erasing"... I tried to build my understanding around that conception and it didn't work very well (Killing is a name). A lot of "simple" mathematical ideas are known by proper names rather than descriptive terms, so as more of these accumulate you have to rely more on memorization than intuition.</p> <p>Outside of concepts, here's what I found tough:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Transition from coursework to research.</strong> Some people are very good at getting the A when the material is put in front of them, and most textbooks are good at giving you the necessary tools to solve the problems they present. I found the transition to more open-ended problems a significant challenge.</li> <li><strong>Understanding the frontier of a field.</strong> As stated in a previous response, it's tough to get to the frontier of a field. It takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. So graduate school requires a lot of perseverance.</li> </ul>

This text bridges the gap, offering a systematic development of the real number system and careful treatment of mappings, sequences, limits, continuity, and metric spaces. The first five chapters consist of a systematic development of many of the important properties of the real number system, plus detailed treatment of such concepts as mappings, sequences, limits, and continuity. The sixth and final chapter discusses metric spaces and generalizes many of the earlier concepts and results involving arbitrary metric spaces. An index of axioms and key theorems appears at the end of the book, and more than 300 problems amplify and supplement the material within the text. Geared toward students who have taken several semesters of basic calculus, this volume is an ideal prerequisite for mathematics majors preparing for a two-semester course in advanced calculus
__label__0 I'm not an extremely mathy person. I can solve basic math problems, and with some thought I can even solve some complex math problems. My public high school math education was lacking, and as my oldest son prepares for algebra next year, he is quickly surpassing my easily accessed math knowledge. Because of these factors, the Algebra Survival Guide: A Conversational Handbook for the Thoroughly Befuddled caught my attention.  The Algebra Survival Guide is a 276-page step-by-step algebra 1 book. Each black-and-white page covers one algebraic concept in a question-and-answer format. The question is at the top of the page, and the answer is at the bottom, along with examples and a few practice problems. Because each page covers only one concept, and because there are usually as many words explaining the concept as numbers, this book is wonderful for those of us intimidated by math. The pages are visually appealing, with cartoons and separate text boxes for important information. The Algebra Survival Guide Workbook includes thousands of practice problems (with answers), and because it is cross-referenced to the Algebra Survival Guide, it is easy to locate additional practice problems.  The Algebra Survival Guide can be used as an algebra reference book, a resource for explaining difficult concepts, or a refresher course before taking Algebra 2. The book is only $19.95, and the workbook is only $9.95, so this is an extremely affordable course. If you or your students are thoroughly befuddled by algebra, I would highly recommend the Algebra Survival Guide.  Product review by Courtney Larson, The Old Schoolhouse® Magazine, LLC, August 2010
__label__0 Let me explain: one the one hand, linear algebra and calculus are enough to consider a lot of non-trivial problems and describe basic issues in many areas. On the other hand, the various areas of mathematics tend to interact intensely with each other, which is what makes math so cool. So it's going to be difficult to direct you to a specific area, since chances are that a reference that is advanced enough will not be shy about using much more advanced notions (check out the math articles on wikipedia to get an idea of what I mean; even innocuous sounding ones can get pretty intense).  I do want to encourage you to give in to your curiosity: but instead of picking a specific subject, you would be much better off picking up specific references that are written more specifically for your level. There are many of those, look for general math books, e.g. from the AMS and MAA. "Proofs from THE BOOK" might be a bit intense, but roughly at the right level.  Since the various areas of math tend to riff off each other as I mentioned, the last thing you want to do is get specialized too early anyway, so generalist books are better for you now.

__label__0 Mathematics  "For the things of this world cannot be made known without a knowledge of mathematics. " – Roger Bacon, philosopher  Bacon also said that, "mathematics is the gate and key to the sciences." At St. George's, we believe the coalescence of math and science is necessary to create highly adept, numerically and scientifically literate students. An intentional and well-planned mathematics and science curriculum prepares St. George's students for an evolving and global world as well as for advanced study in college.  An integrated approach to the curriculum and its emphasis on technology seeks to combine mathematical concepts with concrete matters that are addressed in other areas of academic disciplines. High standards with regard to skill development and conceptual understanding are reinforced through project-based learning that encourages students to apply ideas in real-life settings. Through such integration the mathematical concepts being learned in the specific math classes are reinforced and enriched Students in Math 6—Honors delve deeper into topics than students in Math 6 through examining more applications and critical thinking exercises at a much faster pace The final trimester consists of students reading, analyzing, and writing about classic short stories, while honing their reading comprehension skills. Note: Same as course appearing in English section.  Pre-Algebra 7 prepares students for Algebra I and Geometry slope and y-intercept to graphs and linear expressions. In Pre-Algebra 7, visualization continues with consistent modeling of fractions, percents, mathematical operations, equations, probabilities, and algebraic expressions.  Honors Pre-Algebra prepares students for Algebra I and Geometry at a faster pace and in more depth rate of change, slope, and y-intercept to graphs and linear expressions. In Honors Pre-Algebra, visualization continues with consistent modeling of fractions, percents, mathematical operations, equations, probabilities, and algebraic expressions.  In Accelerated Algebra I, students begin learning how to use graphing calculators.  In Honors Honors Algebra I, students begin learning how to use graphing calculators. Students in Honors Algebra I delve deeper and cover topics more rapidly than students in Accelerated Algebra I Additionally, students are introduced to right triangle trigonometry and their applications in the real world. Honors students should expect a rapid pace and more in-depth coverage.  Algebra II focuses on the study of functions, their graphs, and their properties. Specific functions covered include linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic. However, Algebra II also touches on a wide variety of other topics including, but not limited to, solving higher order equations and inequalities, conics, and polynomial and rational expressions. Students develop a clear understanding of the relationship between algebraic equations and their graphs. All work revolves around the process of solving a problem and the mathematical concepts rather than just "getting the answer." Problem solving through both traditional algebraic methods and graphical methods is an important component of the class.  While Algebra II Honors is a continuation of the concepts learned in Algebra I, this course will introduce the student to some of the theory behind those concepts. Honors Algebra II emphasizes the strong and integral relationship between functions and their graphs. Students will solve problems both algebraically and graphically using pencil and paper as well as a graphing calculator. Students will be asked to think beyond calculations and contemplate the roots and the derivations of the topics. Honors Algebra II is a preparatory course for PreCalculus, Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry, Statistics, and Calculus. To that end, this course covers a variety of topics such as linear and nonlinear functions, relations and systems; exponents and logarithms; conics; rational functions; radical functions. Problem solving strategies as well as how concepts are applied will be emphasized throughout the course.  This course is designed to strengthen students' understanding of concepts taught in Algebra II. Students will focus on a deeper study of functions—analyzing equations, graphs and real-world applications—and the introduction of trigonometry topics needed in advanced mathematics courses. Students will collaborate to construct and share knowledge, building their confidence in mathematics and preparing them for courses in high school and College Algebra or Precalculus at the college level.  This is a functions-based course that both reinforces and broadens concepts taught in Algebra II, and introduces new concepts, preparing students for calculus matrices, series & sequence, analytic geometry and introductory calculus.  This is a functions-based course that both reinforces and broadens concepts taught in Algebra II, and introduces new concepts, preparing the students for AP Calculus BC series & sequence, limits and derivatives. Students should expect more independent work and a faster-paced experience.  This course is divided into three sections, calculus, discrete topics, and statistics. Students will experience the concepts of derivatives and integration through applications in calculus. Discrete mathematics is an umbrella of mathematical topics. Topics include game theory and social theory, which use math to discuss human behavior and its effects. The third component, statistics, will be learned as a tool used in decision making. Students will learn to gather, analyze, interpret and report their findings in a systematic and mathematical manner.  AP Statistics is an introductory, non-calculus based college statistics course that emphasizes understanding and analyzing statistical studies. Students will explore the theory of probability, descriptions of statistical measurements, probability distributions, experimental design and statistical inference. Students will be analyzing samples and understanding populations on an ongoing basis. Graphing calculators are used throughout the course. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.  AP Calculus AB is a college-level calculus course that is generally equivalent to a first semester college course: differentiation and integration of polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions. Calculators and computers are used to increase and strengthen the students' understanding of the concepts. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.  AP Calculus BC is a college-level calculus course that is generally equivalent to the first two semesters of the college Calculus sequence all of the Calculus AB topics as well as additional topics, such as series and polar coordinates. Calculators and computers are used to increase and strengthen the students' understanding of the concepts. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.

__label__0 short video tutorial deals with the concept of order of operations in mathematics problems and builds on the material covered in earlier lessons.  The narrator reviews the concept, explaining that when a problem contains some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division, the order of operations specifies that the multiplication and division components must be completed first, before carrying out the addition and subtraction work.  He then explains that when the problem contains calculations contained within brackets, the bracketed calculations must be completed first.  The tutorial introduces the mnemonic BEDMAS, which stands for Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction, although the instructor points out that exponents will be dealt with only in higher mathematics.  Citation  Share  The order of operations specifies that the multiplication and division components of a math problem must be completed before carrying out the addition and subtraction work. It also specifies that calculations contained within brackets must be completed first.  This video tutorial reinforces that concept by providing three mathematics problems to solve. Each problem is more challenging than the one before.  The problems appear on a computer screen, with the narrator giving step-by-step instructions on how to solve themCitation  Share  This report examines a set of policies and practices formerly in place in British Columbia that supported access to post-secondary education and upgrading programs for income assistance (IA) recipients, particularly those facing multiple barriers to employment and education. The policies ended in 2002.  Based on interviews with staff who delivered these programs in colleges and institutes during the late 1990s, the authors describe the "best practices" for programs designed to help people with low income improve their educational credentials.  They found that effective programs address the key areas of access, retention, and transition. Other key components include identification of the existence of multiple obstacles to accessing formal education; outreach activities and strong links with community and relevant government agencies; assessment of students' needs and capabilities; financial help with tuition, fees, books, housing, and child care; and support for academic success, including counselling, advocacy, networking, and partnerships with employers.  The authors call on the British Columbia government to change welfare rules so that people receiving income assistance can participate in postsecondary education; restore and increase designated funding to post-secondary institutions to support IA recipients; support colleges and institutes in providing programs and services that offer holistic support to students; and restore tuition-free adult basic education in British Columbia's public post-secondary institutions.  Citation  Share  Phased-in retirement is really a catch phrase that can include special assignments, mentoring, job sharing, and end to shift work, reduced hours and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the tax, pension and paperwork implications of these accommodations pose barriers that can translate into inertia.  In New Brunswick it was the nurses' union that brought phased-in retirement to the bargaining table. Having spent so many years fighting for improved pensions, unions are cautious about sending mixed signals to employers. As our Viewpoints survey found, however, the strongest support for phased-in retirement does in fact come from public sector unions, (48% citing this option as very important in meeting the skill shortage challenge, Viewpoints 2002).  Citation  Share  George and John talked about language and empowerment - giving consumers the information they need to run their lives effectively and safely. They gave examples of baffling communication, and explained why people use complicated language. They discussed some of the myths that surround the term "plain language" and showed how the techniques go beyond just crafting the words. Finally, they used case studies to illustrate the benefits of plain language - efficiency, profitability, precision, and consumer satisfaction.  Citation  Share  This is a report on the National Literacy Secretariat's "Policy Conversation on New Technologies and Literacy." It provides background information about the NLS and an overview of some new technologies. It also explains the policy conversation process, which was intended to obtain information and opinions from the public about whether or not a policy on literacy and technology is needed and if it is, what some of its components might be.

__label__0 cise Calculator Tutorial  The format for the tutorial is different. It is more 'show and tell'. The calculator is a Scientific Programmable Calculator (usually people are concerned and do not like the math or advanced calculators). The idea is to give the problems with how to do, then they can just change the variables (where you put A= 5 - or some number and then all they need to do is change the variables - [the number where A= ??] and it will work the problem. Or see how the calculator is programmed and write their own programs. The easier the calculator is to use, the more chance they will use it (the calculator is FREE). - How can I change it to make it better (all areas). You can download the calculator and use it (FREE). More examples will be posted as I get time. - Thank You falcon  My error. The site is the page Precise Calculator Manual (the link) The Calculator is the link in the banner 'Precise Calculator Download' also there is 'Precise Calculator Examples'. These should make it easier to use and understand. My goal is to make it easy, so anything that needs to be clarified is what I am looking for. I have been programming and setting up calculators (different makes and models) so I miss the concepts or areas that you don't understand because many I take for granted. Mostly using TI calculators and programming in Basic, But many free ones are able to achieve the same results and this is one of the better FREE ones and is easy to program and use (also is better than some expensive ones). I didn't write the calculator program, just trying to help students be able to use it to calculate some advanced math. - Thank You falcon  Good idea! At this stage it's like BASIC with some buttons around. To make really quick improvements, alter it's syntax: 1. To automatically PRINT raw expressions (i.e. "2+2" line should print "4") 2. To automatically ASK for unknown variables (i.e. "2*X+5" should ask with popup for X value and then print the result).  In general, you should do this as web service for people to calculate online and share common library of macroses.  Check top of page 'Related Articles' "Download Precise Calculator". There you should see many Macros that you can 'copy and paste' to the calculator and run. Then add to your stored Macros. We are adding to the Macros every week, plus we intend to add some line-by-line descriptions for some of the Macros. Make it as easy a possible to use this FREE Programmable Scientific Calculator. - Thank You falcon
__label__0 Mathematics  To be well informed adults and to have access to desirable jobs, our students require a mathematics education that goes beyond what was needed by students in the past. All students must develop, deepen, and sharpen their skills, their understanding of mathematical concepts and processes, their abilities in problem-solving, reasoning, and communication abilities and hone their ability to make sense of and to solve compelling and complex problems. In order for this to occur, rigorous mathematical content must be organized, taught, and assessed in a problem-solving environment. Students' mathematical knowledge must be connected to the ideas and skills found in all grade levels, as well as to real life situations outside the classroom.  Our goal is to equip each of our students with the ability and preparation to meet the mathematical demands presented by college and careers, and to carry their mathematical thinking and problem-solving into multiple learning situations.  Conceptual Understanding: Making sense of mathematics  Students who understand a concept can: • identify examples and non-examples • describe concepts with words, symbols, drawings, tables or models • provide a definition of a concept • use the concept in different ways Expectations for conceptual understanding ask students to demonstrate, describe, represent, connect, and justify.  Procedural Proficiency: Skills, facts, and procedures  Students who demonstrate procedural proficiency can: • quickly recall basic facts (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division) • use standard algorithms – step-by-step mathematical procedures – to produce a correct solution or answer (might also include multiple algorithms) • use generalized procedures (such as the steps involved in solving an algebraic equation) • demonstrate fluency with procedures: o perform the procedure immediately and accurately o know when to use a particular procedure in a problem or situation o use the procedure as a tool that can be applied reflexively, and doesn't distract from the task at hand (procedure is stored in long-term memory)  Problem-solving and Processes: reasoning and thinking to apply mathematical content  Students must be able to: • reason • solve problems • communicate theirunderstanding in effective ways • solve increasingly complex problems from grade to grade • use increasingly sophisticated language and symbols to communicate their understanding, from grade to grade  Students may substitute a state-approved option for Algebra II, but should check with colleges regarding admission requirements.  PreCalculus  Recommended for College & Career Preparation  12  PreCalculus, AP Statistics, or IB Mathematics  AP Calculus AB, AP Statistics, or IB Mathematics  *A small number of students – generally those in the APP program at the elementary level - will participate in mathematics two years above grade level. Assuming students continue in this pathway, they would take Math 8 in sixth grade and Algebra II in ninth grade, finishing with BC Calculus or IB Mathematics in twelfth grade.  **Beginning in 2010-2011 school year, students enrolled in Algebra I or Geometry will take the state End of Course (EOC) exam for that course, given in June of each year. Students who have taken Algebra I or Geometry prior to 2010-2011 will take a makeup test in that subject, also given in June.
__label__0 Algebra Lesson Plans  "Students should understand the concept of slope and be able to calculate the slope of a line given two points on a graph. Students should be able to calculate the slope of a line that is parallel and a line that is perpendicular to a line with a given slope."  "This activity is designed to give students practice in "finding" the correct factors to use when attempting to factor a trinomial. The students are provided with a Tic-Tac sheet to help them discover the relationship or pattern between two numbers. Students then use their discovery to fill in a second Tic Tac sheet. At this point students have uncovered the mystery of how to locate the appropriate factors in a given trinomial. They can now factor any trinomial placed in front of them!" This lesson plan contains all necessary worksheets.  "This lesson will teach students to factor trinomial expressions of the form x2 + bx + c. Students will use algebra tiles to identify the binomial factors and the graphing calculator to verify the result. In addition, students will identify the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of each trinomial function and explore relationships between the trinomial x2 + bx + c and its factored form (x + m)(x + n). "  "This activity uses a series of related arithmetic experiences to prompt students to generalize into more abstract ideas. In particular, students explore arithmetic statements leading to a result that is the factoring pattern for the difference of two squares. A geometric interpretation of the familiar formula is also included."  "This lesson provides students with an introduction to exponential functions. The class first explores the world population since 1650. Students then conduct a simulation in which a population grows at a random yet predictable rate. Both situations are examples of exponential growth."  "This lesson will teach students about several of the rules regarding exponents. It uses a situation from Alice in Wonderland in which Alice's height is doubled or reduced by half depending on what she consumes to introduce negative exponents and the rules for dividing powers."  "This lesson teaches students about direct variation by allowing them to explore a simulated oil spill using toilet paper tissues (to represent land) and drops of vegetable oil (to simulate a volume of oil)."  "This lesson teaches students about inverse variation by exploring the relationship between the heights of a fixed amount of water poured into cylindrical containers of different sizes as compared to the area of the containers' bases."
__label__0 Synopsis:Stuck On Algebra is a classroom-proven interactive Algebra workstation that keeps students on task doing traditional Algebra in a classic gaming model combining an unbending standard of proficiency with the forgiving and encouraging spirit of "failure without consequence". The result: steady improvement and repeated small successes, the addictive formula of video games without any dilution of the Algebra experience.  Background: SOA is the second generation of a system last sold in the early 90s. More than one educator who used that system in the 90s has sought me out in recent years to ask if it were still available. SOA is available now for beta testing here.  Software In Brief: SOA offers: step-by-step guidance and correction of basic Algebra I problems entered by the student or generated by the application; solved solutions with explanations of generated problems; unassisted exams on a hierarchy of Algebra topics.  Transformations SOA transforms learning mathematics in several important ways:  1. Thanks to step-by-step checking, weak arithmetic skills do not prevent the learner from succeeding with Algebra. Those skills improve as mistakes are caught. The student must work to figure out what they did wrong and correct it. Progress is slower at first, but they are working on Algebra instead of yet another tedious worksheet of arithmetic, so the learner's motivation to persevere is strong.  2. Assistance available in Training Modes lets students of any ability experience the pleasure of solving Algebra puzzles and enjoy math in its own right. They may make more mistakes getting there, but that only increases the satisfaction of finally succeeding and draws them into further study.  3. With SOA correcting all the work, tracking student progress, and offering first-level assistance when students get stuck, the teacher has more time to work with students individually or in small groups.  4. In Mission Mode learners must meet a fixed standard of mastery by passing unassisted, "no second chance" challenges. Missions become available only as prerequisite missions are passed, so the independent learner has a structure they can follow. For any student, Missions draw learners into ever more high-quality practice as they attempt repeatedly to pass the unassisted challenges, encouraged by getting closer each time to succeeding.  Summary The system works for several reasons.  First, Algebra is easy but there is a lot of it and it is cumulative. Algebra requires fluent application of many easy rules, which in turn requires a substantial quantity of high-quality practice to make those rules second-nature. With SOA students get more practice with ever-present feedback and assistance.  Second, Algebra is fun for any student as long as they are given the fighting chance to solve problems on their own. SOA's instant feedback, detailed hints, and solved examples give them that chance.  Third, the stigma of failure is lifted without compromising the standard of proficiency that must be met. The satisfaction of small successes and evidence of steady improvement even as they fail at exams draws learners into further practice and eventual mastery. This is precisely the addictive formula of computer gaming.

Marge, who received Bachelor's and Master's degrees from California State University at Sacramento, is now affiliated with American River College. Marge is an avid reader and traveler. Her travel experiences often find their way into her books as applications, exercise sets, and feature sets. She is particularly interested in archeology. Trips to various digs and ruin sites have produced some fascinating problems for her textbooks involving such topics as the building of Mayan pyramids and the acoustics of ancient ball courts in the Yucatan.  When John Hornsby enrolled as an undergraduate at Louisiana State University, he was uncertain whether he wanted to study mathematics education or journalism. His ultimate decision was to become a teacher, but after twenty-five years of teaching at the high school and university levels and fifteen years of writing mathematics textbooks, both of his goals have been realized. His love for both teaching and for mathematics is evident in his passion for working with students and fellow teachers as well. His specific professional interests are recreational mathematics, mathematics history, and incorporating graphing calculators into the curriculum. John's personal life is busy as he devotes time to his family (wife Gwen, and sons Chris, Jack, and Josh). He has been a rabid baseball fan all of his life. John's other hobbies include numismatics (the study of coins) and record collecting. He loves the music of the 1960s and has an extensive collection of the recorded works of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  David Schneider has taught mathematics at universities for over 34 years and has authored 36 books. He has an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Oberlin College and a PhD in mathematics from MIT. During most of his professional career, he was on the faculty of the University of Maryland--College Park. His hobbies include travel, dancing, bicycling, and hiking.  Callie Daniels has always had a passion for learning mathematics and brings that passion into the classroom with her students.

Unit B is worth about 25% of your final mark. The exam is one hour long. This is a non-calculator exam.  Unit C is worth about 50% of your final mark. The exam is two hours long for the Higher Tier and 1.5 hours long for the Foundation Tier. You are expected to use a calculator in this exam.  Each module is offered at two tiers:  Higher is for students working at grades A*-D  Foundation is for students working at grades C-G  Modules take place in November, January and June. Your teacher will tell you which exam you are taking next and when it will be.  Revision materials for the modules:  I am planning to have some materials online by September 2011.  I was working on revision materials for the modules, but my school has now subscribed to the very excellent MyMaths.co.uk, which has lots of excellent materials for revision. There are lots of changes planned to GCSE maths in the near future, so I've decided not to spend lots of time making things for this site that will end up getting scrapped! I will be working on some learning resources, watch the news page for more details.
__label__0 Representation Standard for Grades 9–12  Instructional programs from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students to—  create and use representations to organize, record, and communicate mathematical ideas;  select, apply, and translate among mathematical representations to solve problems;  use representations to model and interpret physical, social, and mathematical phenomena.  If mathematics is the "science of patterns" (Steen 1988), representations are the means by which those patterns are recorded and analyzed. As students become mathematically sophisticated, they develop an increasingly large repertoire of mathematical representations and the knowledge of how to use them productively. This knowledge includes choosing specific representations in order to gain particular insights or achieve particular ends.  The importance of representations can be seen in every section of this chapter. If large or small numbers are expressed in scientific notation, their magnitudes are easier to compare and they can more readily be used in computations. Representation is pervasive in algebra. Graphs convey particular kinds of information visually, whereas symbolic expressions may be easier to manipulate, analyze, and transform. Mathematical modeling requires representations, as illustrated in the "drug dosage" problem and in the "pipe offset" problem. The use of matrices to represent transformations in the plane illustrates how geometric operations can be represented visually yet also be amenable to symbolic representation and manipulation in a way that helps students understand them. The various methods for representing data sets further demonstrate the centrality of this topic.  p. 360  A wide variety of representations can be seen in the examples in this chapter. By using various representations for the "counting rectangles" problem in the "Problem Solving" section, students could find different solutions and compare them. The use of algebraic symbolism to explain a striking graphical phenomenon is central to the "string traversing tiles" task in the "Communication" section. Representations facilitate reasoning and are the tools of proof: they are used to examine statistical relationships and to establish the validity of a builder's shortcut. They are at the core of communication and support the development of understanding in Marta's and Nancy's work on the "string traversing tiles" problem. Although at one level the story of Mr. Robinson's class is about connections, at another level it is about representation: one group of students places coordinates that "make things eeeasy," the class gains insights from dynamic representations of geometric objects, and the students produce proofs in coordinate and Euclidean geometry. A major lesson of that story is that different representations support different ways of thinking about and manipulating mathematical objects. An object can be better understood when viewed through multiple lenses. »  What should representation look like in grades 9 through 12?  In grades 9–12, students' knowledge and use of representations should expand in scope and complexity. As they study new content, for example, students will encounter many new representations for mathematical concepts. They will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations. Much of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate on objects from different perspectives.  In elementary school, students most often use representations to reason about objects and actions they can perceive directly. In the middle grades, students increasingly create and use mathematical representations for objects that are not perceived directly, such as rational numbers or rates. By high school, students are working with such increasingly abstract entities as functions, matrices, and equations. Using various representations of these objects, students should be able to recognize common mathematical structures across different contexts. For example, the sum of the first n odd natural numbers, the areas of square gardens, and the distance traveled by a vehicle that starts at rest and accelerates at a constant rate can be represented by functions of the form f(x) = ax2. The fact that these situations can be represented by the same class of functions implies that they are alike in some fundamental mathematical way. Students are ready in high school to see similarity in the underlying structure of mathematical objects that appear contextually different but whose representations look quite similar.  p. 361  High school students should be able to create and interpret models of more-complex phenomena, drawn from a wider range of contexts, by identifying essential features of a situation and by finding representations that capture mathematical relationships among those features. They should recognize, for example, that phenomena with periodic features often are best modeled by trigonometric functions and that population growth tends to be exponential, or logistic. They will learn » to describe some real-world phenomena with iterative and recursive representations.  Consider the graph of the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude during the period from 1986 through 1991 (see fig. 7.39) (Sarmiento 1993). Teachers might use an example such as this to help students understand and interpret several aspects of representation. Students could discuss the trends in the change in concentration of CO2 as a function of time as well as latitude. Doing so would draw on their knowledge about classes of functions and their ability to interpret three-dimensional graphs. They should be able to see a roughly linear increase across time, coupled with a sinusoidal fluctuation with the seasons. Focusing on the change in the character of the graph as a function of latitude, students should note that the amplitude of the sinusoidal function lessens from north to south. Students can test whether the trends they observe in the graph correspond to recent theoretical work on CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. For example, the author of the article attributes the sinusoidal fluctuation to seasonal variations in the amount of photosynthesis taking place in the terrestrial biosphere. Students could discuss the differences in amplitude across seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Fig. 7.39. A three-dimensional graph of the concentration of C02 in the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude (Adapted from Sarmiento [1993])  Electronic technologies provide access to problems and methods that until recently were difficult to explore meaningfully in high school. In order to use the technologies effectively, students will need to become familiar with the representations commonly used in technological settings. For example, solving equations or multiplying matrices using a computer algebra system calls for learning how to input and interpret information in formats used by the system. Many software tools that students might use include special icons and symbols that carry particular meaning or are needed to operate the tool; students will need to learn about these representations and distinguish them from the mathematical objects they are manipulating.  What should be the teacher's role in developing representation in grades 9 through 12?  p. 362  An important part of learning mathematics is learning to use the language, conventions, and representations of mathematics. Teachers should introduce students to conventional mathematical representations » and help them use those representations effectively by building on the students' personal and idiosyncratic representations when necessary. It is important for teachers to highlight ways in which different representations of the same objects can convey different information and to emphasize the importance of selecting representations suited to the particular mathematical tasks at hand (Yerushalmy and Schwartz 1993; Moschkovich, Schoenfeld, and Arcavi 1993). For example, tables of values are often useful for quick reference, but they provide little information about the nature of the function represented. Consider the table in the "Algebra" section in this chapter that gives the number of minutes of daylight in Chicago every other day for the year 2000. The values in the table suggest that the function is initially increasing and then becomes decreasing. Knowledge of the context of a graph of those values suggests that the behavior is actually periodic. Similarly, algebraic and graphical representations of functions may provide different information. Some global properties of functions, such as asymptotic behavior or the rate of growth of a function, are often most readily apparent from graphs. But information about specific aspects of a function—the exact value of f() or exact values of x where f(x)has a maximum or a minimum—may best be determined using an algebraic representation of the function. Suppose g(x) is given by the equation g(x) = f(x) + 1, for all x. The analytic definitions of f(x) and g(x) may offer the most-effective ways of computing specific values of f(x) and g(x), but graphing the function reveals that the "shape" of g(x) is precisely the same as that of f(x)—that the graph of g(x) is obtained by translating the graph of f(x) one unit upward.  As in all instruction, what matters is what the student sees, hears, and understands. Often, students interpret what teachers may consider wonderfully lucid presentations in ways that are very different from those their teachers intended (Confrey 1990; Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle 1993). Or they may invent representations of content that are idiosyncratic and have personal meaning but do not look at all like conventional mathematical representations (Confrey, 1991; Hall et al. 1989). Part of the teacher's role is to help students connect their personal images to more-conventional representations. One very useful window into students' thinking is student-generated representations. To illustrate this point, consider the following problem (adapted from Hughes-Hallett et al. [1994, p. 6]) that might be presented to a tenth-grade class:  A flight from SeaTac Airport near Seattle, Washington, to LAX Airport in Los Angeles has to circle LAX several times before being allowed to land. Plot a graph of the distance of the plane from Seattle against time from the moment of takeoff until landing.  p. 363  Students could work individually or in pairs to produce distance-versus-time graphs for this problem, and teachers could ask them to present and defend those graphs to their classmates. Graphs produced by this class, or perhaps by students in other classes, could be handed out for careful critique and comment. When they perform critiques, students get a considerable amount of practice in communicating mathematics as well as in constructing and improving on representations, and the teacher gets information that can be helpful in assessment. One representation of the flight that a student might produce is shown in figure 7.40. »  Fig. 7.40. A representation that a student might produce of an airplane's distance from its take-off point against the time from takeoff to landing  This representation indicates a number of interesting and not uncommon misunderstandings, in which literal features of the story (the plane flying at constant height or circling around the airport) are converted inappropriately into features of the graph (Dugdale 1993; Leinhardt, Zaslavsky, and Stein 1990). Representations of this type can provoke interesting classroom conversations, revealing what the students really understand about graphing. This revelation puts the teacher in a better position to move the class toward a more nearly accurate representation, as sketched in figure 7.41.  Fig. 7.41. A more nearly accurate representation of the airplane's distance from its take-off point against the time from takeoff to landing  Mathematics is one of humankind's greatest cultural achievements. It is the "language of science," providing a means by which the world around us can be represented and understood. The mathematical representations that high school students learn afford them the opportunity to understand the power and beauty of mathematics and equip them to use representations in their personal lives, in the workplace, and in further study.
__label__0 Teaching Conic Sections  Teaching Conic Sections  So I currently teach a precalc class and new this year we are required to teach conic section. We cover parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Since I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it? The book we use has a bunch of formulas, but I'm looking for a way to teach it to my students without using all the formulas so they don't have to memorize a bunch of formulas before their exam. What has worked for others?  You should be able to design good lessons directly based on the book sections. As long as you use a Pre-Calculus book you will have rich enough information available.  Be sure to demonstrate the conic sections using a realistic three-dimensional model. Also use the definitions of each conic section and the distance formula to derive the equation for each conic section, and include the analytical cartesian graph for each.  You are right on-target about not just giving a bunch of formulas. The demonstration and the derivations are important for learning and understanding.  Teaching Conic Sections  As a student who struggled through conic sections, I found that by exploring how they were really just variations of the of the same things cemented my understanding of the topic. So if I were in your shoes I would try to show the similarities and differences of the different sections. Specifically between the hyperbola and parabola and the circle and ellipse.  As someone who not long ago learnt Conic Sections, I found the derivations of the formula much easier than remembering them. It was good to see the formulas at first but I much preferred the derivations.  As above said, use a 3D model as well. The 2D drawing didn't really do it justice for me.  I was definitely going to derive the formulas using the distance formula and talk about applications. I wouldn't scratch formulas altogether, but our book has like 8 different formulas, which isn't fair to give all of them to my students if I don't give them on an exam.  Something one of my physics professors said to our class is recalled to me by this thread. He said students of today are so used to tv games, comics, etc. rather than playing with things with their hands, that they can't visualize 3d objects anymore. He was of course exaggerating. I think it quite odd if a student can't visualize what's going on with conic sections, so yes a model would be quite good. Maybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.  Also, the old books on geometry, particularly solid geometry, should be good with conic sections, so maybe go down to the library and have a look at them.  Ah yes, I have a fun experiment using that! You should certainly teach that!  Here it goes: Dandelin was a Belgian, and some people decided to celebrate him. So what they did was the following. They made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone). And they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone. Then they would sell it to people.I always tought that it was very clever, and it was quite the financial succes too!did they then discover another, smaller, ice-cream (just like discovering another layer of chocolates when you finish the first layer!), which touched the other focus on the other side of the biscuit?

__label__0 Merrill, Carole  8th Grade Math/Algebra  Math at the 8th grade level includes state objectives one through six. Objective one concerns numbers, objective wo concerns patterns and algebraic thinking, objective three covers geometry, objective four is about measurement, objective five concerns statistical analysis and probability, and objective six covers critical thinking and problem solving strategies. Students are refining skills using ratios and proportions, pattern recognition, making predictions, and some fundamental skills that will prepare them for Algebra and geometry.  Algebra is the study of patterns and making predictions. Patterns can be found in linear, quadratic and exponential forms. Students look at, and make predictions about these patterns in graphs, tables, equations and apply them problems in business, the sciences and every day living.  This year, in both 8th grade math and in AlgebraI, we are using C-scope for our curriculum.

__label__0 In this limits worksheet, students apply L'Hopital's rule to solve four limits problems. They solve a total of eleven short answer problems. The final seven problems ask students to find the asymptotes of functions.  In this limiting reagent and percent yield worksheet, students fill in 6 blanks with terms related to limiting reagents and percent yield. They determine if 6 statements are true or false, they match 5 terms with their definitions and they solve 2 problems related to percent yield and limiting reagents.  Students examine the importance of limiting power in governments. In this government lesson, students investigate the importance of placing limits on government by looking at the US Constitution. They look at ways that being an active citizen benefits the common good and study the definition of philanthropy.  In this limits and continuity test, learners solve 8 multiple choice questions. They define the words limits and continuity. Students determine the limits of 8 functions. Learners find the value for a constant in one function, and prove one function is continuous at x=0. 4 questions require students to graph functions. There are 25 questions in all (plus one extra credit question).  In this infinite limit instructional activity, students compute horizontal and vertical asymptotes. They use trigonometric functions to find the limits of functions and compare results. This two-page instructional activity contains examples and explanations and fourteen problems.  In this successive approximations activity, students use the Babylonian algorithm to determine the roots of given numbers. They identify the limits of a function, and compute the rate of change in a linear function. This two-page activity contains explanations, examples, and approximately ten problems.

__label__0 PUMP Algebra Curriculum Home Page  This page is very out of date and is currently being modified. In the meantime, please go to Carnegie Learning to learn more about currently available cognitive tutors for mathematics and writing.  Who are we?  The PUMP(Pittsburgh Urban Mathematics Project) Algebra Project is a collaboration between the ACT Research Group and the PACT Center at Carnegie Mellon University, and a group of teachers in the Pittsburgh Public Schools. It is an attempt to make high school Algebra accessible to all students through the use of situational curriculum materials and an intelligent computer based tutoring system.  The high school tutor and course materials are now called "Cognitive Tutor Algebra" and are being marketed by the PACT Center's spin-off company, Carnegie Learning. The PACT Center is currently developing tutors for Middle School math.  The development of Algebra throughout the curriculum is based on the students' own informal knowledge of mathematics and on problem situations. Modelling situations such as the Nintendo Problem, shown above, students begin to construct intuitive understandings of and connections between multiple representations of functions. From the beginning of the course students are asked to make the connections between the various representations and to construct each representation based on their understanding of the problem situation.  A mere listing of topics covered does not adequately provide the necessary framework for the curriculum. Consequently, we use a matrix which attempts to show the development of the curriculum in a more meaningful way; however, a three dimensional framework showing the multiple representations as the core which expands from the first quadrant with simple direct variation to mx+b to all four quadrants to systems to data analysis to quadratics would probably be more appropriate.  Currently students work in their regular classrooms three days a week on the curriculum. The other two class periods are spent in the computer lab working on the computer tutors. (See the PAT tutor). The classroom curriculum is reproduced for each student on loose-leaf notebook paper with space for them to write their responses on the actual workbook. ALL answers must be written in complete sentences. Homework is also reproduced on loose-leaf. TI-81 scientific calculators are provided by the school for use in the classroom. Each student can be issued a scientific calculator to use on homework.  The U.S. Shirts Problem is a sample three day lesson module from the first quarter of the classroom curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to read over the problem situation at the beginning of the period and then give the students time to work in cooperative groups to solve the problem. Groups are given overlays to describe the problem and asked to present their results to the rest of the class.  Learning in Cooperative Groups  The PUMP project is committed not only to providing the opportunity for all students to enroll in Algebra, but also to providing the students with the human and technological support to enable them to be successful in Algebra. This support includes the computer tutors, the support of the Chapter One reading specialist, after school tutoring, Family Algebra Nights, the inclusion of Special Education students and teachers, support for the teachers including summer workshops and on-going help, and new assessment strategies.  Family Algebra Night  Student assessment is a major area of emphasis. The first semester final exam and the year end final exam from the1993-94 school year are presented to the new students at the beginning of the school year along with level 4 student responses in order to clearly communicate our expectations to the students. Students are assessed on their performance on group tasks in the classroom, individual on demand performance tasks, portfolios, and their work on the computer tutors, as well as on more the traditional homework and tests. At the end of each grading period students are given an individual on-demand performance task similar to the situations that they have worked on in the classroom. Each of these requires the student to do a mathematical analysis of a situation and to produce a writen report based on their analysis. At the end of the first and third grading periods, these tasks are graded by the individual teachers; but at the end of each semester these tasks are graded using the New Standards Type Grading Conference Model.

This will allow you to set up the type of notifications you would like to receive so that you know when your student needs some additional support. You may select the range of scores from which you would like to receive notifications for as well as select when you would like to receive a progress report for your student (monthly, weekly, or daily)  4.Then Click SAVE  Because the Algebra grades can fluctuate so much at any given time, I would like to suggest that you set this notification process up so that you are always aware of how well your student is doing in the class  Katie O'Brien  Welcome to Pre AP Algebra I!  The overarching goal of Holt Algebra I is to help students develop mathematical knowledge, understanding, and skills, as well as awareness and appreciation of the rich connections among mathematical strands and between mathematics and other disciplines.  In accordance with the district's self directed learning initiative, most of the homework assignments will consist of students completing problems from the day's lesson (answers are in the back of the book), reading the next section to be covered, taking notes and defining key terms/ vocabulary from the section, answering at least one "Check It Out" problem under each example highlighted in the section and answering one, two or all of the "Think and Discuss" questions from the section.  Students have HOMEWORK every night and it is posted on the board everyday. Students are expected to copy the homework assignment in their agendas. Student success is directly correlated to students continued dedication to completing and checking homework. Please check that your student has COMPLETED the homework assignment each night or before they arrive at school the next day.
__label__0 Welcome to Calculus! This semester will be a challenging one for you, but hopefully, with my suggestions, you will be able to successfully get through this class!  In order to succeed, you will have to know some things even before you walk into your Calculus classroom on the first day. First off, sit towards the front. If you do this, you will be forced to pay attention. Secondly, make sure you get to know the people that sit around you. If you are outgoing, strive to know the majority of the people in the class. This will make class time more enjoyable for you but will also help you with your grades. If you have trouble with something, you will have a peer to ask for help out of class. Lastly, when your professor gives you the syllabus for the semester, start right away! Start to do some of the assigned problems. If they don't make any sense to you, at least read the material you will be going over in class the next day thouroughly.  There have been many things that I have discovered over the course of the semester that could be of value to you. First, always keep up with your assignments. Have your assignment done so that you can follow along when your professor lectures about the topic. Some of the assigned problems will be difficult and you will not be able to understand them. When this comes up, make sure that you ask questions. The best way is to ask questions while in class. If class time runs out, do not just forget about the problems you had on the assignment, go in and ask your professor during his/her office hours. In addition to doing your assignments, take your own notes from the book. This will help you to understand topics covered in lecture better. For me, this technique really worked. Once I began to take my own notes in addition to the notes I took from my professor's lecture, I did a lot better, especially on my weekly quizzes. Lastly, everyone messes up sometimes. If you get a bad grade on a quiz or an exam, make sure you know all the mistakes you made and why. Chances are, you will see problems that you had trouble with on comprehensive tests. Learn from your mistakes, and you will do better the next time you have the opportunity.  I hope some of my suggestions help you during your semester in Calculus. Good luck!

__label__0 Authors  Why a liberal arts mathematics book with a quantitative literacy focus?  How do you engage students with the study of math? Crauder, Evans, Johnson, and Noell have found the answer: Help them become intelligent consumers of the quantitative data to which they are exposed every day—in the news, on TV, and on the Internet.  In an age of record credit card debt, opinion polls, and questionable statistics, too few students have mastered the basic mathematical concepts required to think about and evaluate data. Quantitative Literacy: Thinking Between the Lines develops the idea of rates of change as a key concept in helping students make good personal, financial, and political decisions.  The goal of Quantitative Literacy is a more informed generation of college students who think critically about the data provided to them, the images shown to them, the facts presented to them, and the offers made to them. Quantitative Literacy shows students the mathematics that matters to them: their bank account, their medical tests, their daily news feed. It also develops their mathematical thinking, helping them to understand the difference between truthful and misleading mathematical reporting.  It's All in the Examples…  After taking your course and working with Quantitative Literacy, students will be equipped to think about and answer all of the following questions:  Will the Atkins Diet really help me lose weight?  How do I use logic to get the best results from a Google search?  Is the local carpet store trying to fool me into thinking their prices are lower because they quote price by the square foot instead of the square yard?  How far can I go on this tank of gas?  How do I interpret the results of my medical tests?  How can businesspeople and politicians use graphs and charts to mislead me?  Will inflation affect my savings and the age at which I can retire?  How do I avoid getting tricked by a Ponzi scheme?  I want to buy a new car in two years. How much do I need to save each month to achieve my goal? How much car can I really afford?  Why are games of chance so financially risky?  Does the golden rectangle explain the beauty of some paintings and architecture?

__label__0 Lessons for Algebra I - Linear equations  Summary: This is an iMovie which is designed to help students and viewers to understand how to derive linear equations from few given points by calculating slopes and y-intercepts of straight lines. Then post their responses to given problems for further feedback.  Links  Example links  Contex  This project is designed as an open educational source so that anyone learning online may may have access to the lessons. Traditional classroom students who miss classes and independent learners may have access to this project's lectures.  Objective  These lesson learners are able to develop linear equations from few given points by calculating slopes and y-intercepts.  Project Rationale/Purpose  The purpose of this project is to provide students who have missed classes a chance to catch up, to assist independent learners who might be in preparations of GED exams, and other online learners who wwould like to increase their math general knowledge. Additionally, this project is to support English Language Learners (ELL) who have difficulties keeping up with live lecture pace (Merryfield, 2003).  Why This project Was Put On YouTube?  YouTube is an interesting media that attracts a huge number of Internet surfers. It was created in 2005; however, it had the third largest Internet traffic behind Google and Yahoo in 2009. Thefefore, it is an ideal means for distance learning (Bonk, 2009).  Why Asynchronous Communication Was Chosen?  Asynchronous lectures are ideal in distance learn because they convenient for busy individuals who cannot afford to attend regular classes. In addition, they can access these lectures as many times as they like (Harism, 2000). Also asynchronous lectures are convenient for ELL because they cannot keep up with fast paced lectures, and they decode every word they hear in the lecture. At the time they complete processing the first few sentences of the lecture, the speaker may finish the speech or start talking about new materials (Merryfield, 2003). Many postsecondary and K-12 school institutions that implemented online courses and studies found that students learning online modestly perform better than students learning in classrooms (Means et al., 2010).
