All students must complete three years of mathematics and pass a Regents examination.\nAll mathematics courses are year-long courses.\n\nIntegrated Algebra - This is the first mathematics course in high school. The completion of this course -- 1 to 2 years -- depends on the entry level of the student. Algebra provides tools and develops ways of thinking that are necessary for solving problems in a wide variety of disciplines such as science, business, and fine arts. Linear equations, quadratic functions, absolute value, and exponential functions are studied. Coordinate geometry is integrated into this course as well as data analysis, including measures of central tendency and lines of best fit. Elementary probability, right triangle trigonometry, and set theory complete the course. Students will take the Integrated Algebra Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nGeometry - This is the second course in mathematics for high school students. In this course, students will have the opportunity to make conjectures about geometric situations and prove in a variety of ways that their conclusion follows logically from their hypothesis. Congruence and similarity of triangles will be established using appropriate theorems. Transformations including rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations will be taught. Properties of triangles, quadrilaterals and circles will be examined. Geometry is meant to lead students to an understanding that reasoning and proof are fundamental aspects of mathematics. Students will take the Geometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nAlgebra 2 and Trigonometry - This is the third of the three courses in high school mathematics. In this course, the number system will be extended to include imaginary and complex numbers. Students will learn about polynomial, absolute value, radical, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Problem situations involving direct and indirect variation will be solved. Data analysis will be extended to include measures of dispersion and the analysis of regression models. Arithmetic and geometric sequences will be evaluated. Binomial expressions will provide the basis for the study of probability theory, and the normal probability distribution will be analyzed. Right triangle trigonometry will be expanded to include the investigation of circular functions. The course will conclude with problems requiring the use of trigonometric equations and identities. Students will take the Algebra 2 and Trigonometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nCalculus - This course includes an overview of analytic geometry and trigonometry as it applies to the study of functions, graph limits, derivatives and their applications.\n\nCalculus AB, Advanced Placement - This is a full-year course in college-level calculus that culminates in the Advanced Placement (AB) examination. Included is the study of functions, graphs, and limits, derivatives, applications of derivatives, integrals, applications of integrals, the fundamental theorem of calculus, anti-differentiation, applications of the anti-derivative, and slope fields.", "function_call_score": 15.458422174840086, "segments_extracted": 6, "original_length": 3752, "filtered_length": 3405, "compression_ratio": 0.9075159914712153}

{"text": "The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\"\n\nIt is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in.", "function_call_score": 16.534181240063592, "segments_extracted": 7, "original_length": 3145, "filtered_length": 3097, "compression_ratio": 0.9847376788553259}

{"text": "My Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.\n\nPost navigation\n\nReading Math\n\nMy Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook.\n\nCan read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4.\n\nThey'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class.\n\nSince I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nPost navigation\n\n3 thoughts on \"Reading Math\"\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from.", "function_call_score": 32.779995797436435, "segments_extracted": 14, "original_length": 4759, "filtered_length": 4045, "compression_ratio": 0.8499684807732717}

{"text": "So I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory.

Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. HawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology) syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness…\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Spectatorship—Ethics, Politics, Aesthetics Prof. Harries (English) syllabus Are you responsible for what you see? Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Throughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds. These thinkers will, in turn, challenge us to think about the function of images in the present. Readings and films: Plato's Republic, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Rousseau's Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What do we need to function as citizens of a democracy--capacities of reason, imagination, or eloquence? Skills in analyzing public discourse or habits of historical memory? Is belief in God required, or particular emotional tendencies or sympathies? What kind of humanistic values, if any, can and should a democracy promote? We examine these questions on the assumption that intensive close reading (and listening, in Mozart's case) promotes the habits of engaged, articulate talking and writing that are the bedrock of civic education. Music of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Bolduc (French) syllabus Explores how books give shape, meaning, and purpose to the world and human experience. As it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed. Grouped under four main themes--epic and the human experience, tales of beginnings and ends, battles for truth, writings of the self--we consider the purpose of this conversation between writers of different epochs and its relevance for understanding our own culture. Reading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Garrett (Philosophy) syllabus All animals live, but only human beings consider how to live; and only reflective human beings deliberate among different ways to decide how to live. Should one look for guidance to tradition, to religion, to the state, to nature, to feeling, to reason? Versions of this question were raised and addressed repeatedly and with urgency in both Antiquity and the Enlightenment. We examine some of the most important and influential attempts to answer it and some of the dialogue that such attempts have had with one another. Readings include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Greek tragedy and philosophy, Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Wollstonecraft.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative and Western Thought Prof. Weiler (Law) syllabus Issue of justice and injustice and other normative concerns. Each week pairs a core reading from the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament with another work in the Western tradition to explore a broad range of complex normative issues. Often God will be \"on trial:\" Was the Deluge genocide? Is Abraham guilty of attempted murder and child abuse? Was Jesus guilty as charged? Was Socrates? The themes are all of relevance to contemporary issues: communal responsibility vs. individual autonomy, ecological crisis, ethics vs. religion, freedom of speech and thought, genocide, rule of law and civil disobedience, the Other, punishment and retribution, religious intolerance, sanctity of human life, sex and gender. The course will be taught at the Law School in Law School style—rigourous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Primary readings include: Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology; Xenophon's Apology; Sophocles' Antigone; selections from Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Kierkegaard, Mill, Thoreau, Kafka, Camus.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Free Will in Western Thought Prof. Krabbenhoft (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus The freedom of the human will has been a foundational premise of Western civilization from the early centuries of the Christian era to the present, and yet it has been questioned and even rejected by some of the most influential thinkers of the modern period. We look at the sources of the modern debate in passages from the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, in key texts by Augustine, Luther, and Erasmus, and in the shift toward a deontological view in Kant, Schopenhauer, and nineteenth-century materialism. From this historical overview we move to contemporary theories of freedom and determinism, as well as a discussion of the intersection of neuroscience and the philosophy of free will, and read a number of literary texts in the light of theory: Sophocles' Philoctetes, Tirso de Molina's Trickster of Seville, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom—freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind—as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Mortal and Immortal Questions Professor Mitsis (Classics) syllabus A wide-ranging selection of works that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about the nature of religion, the successes and failures of rational argument, the justification of social and political obligations, the benefits and dangers of technology and scientific knowledge, and the value of emotions and our attachments to others. Throughout the semester, students have the opportunity to become more practiced in formulating moral, political, and aesthetic arguments and in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude, that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death--or, perhaps, worse, faced with eternal life. Readings: Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Epicureans, Stoics, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Augustine, Teresa of Avila, Hume, d'Holbach, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Tolstoy, Freud, Proust.\n\nSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition—science and technology—rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0506 Cultures and Contexts: Chinese and Japanese Traditions Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus Essential aspects of Asian culture—Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0509 Cultures and Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0515 Cultures and Contexts: Latin America Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus Spanish, African, and Amerindian Sources of Latin American Identities. Explores the emergence of contemporary Latin America through the past and present doings of its persons and their representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature. Through in-depth treatment of selected cases, and via the perspectives of history, anthropology, and cultural criticism, focusing on texts but also film, dance, music, and performance, the aims is both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness (and of global modernity) in the historical confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national integration. At base, we seek to answer more fundamental questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of so-called globalization? Includes frank and explicit discussion of race, sex, and religion.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus A range of intersecting questions concerning the African Diaspora and what it produces: What does the trans-Atlantic slave trade create in the early modern and modern world? How is our understanding of trade, culture, capitalism, justice, race, gender, and work shaped by the histories of dispersal that characterize the Atlantic World? What aspects of culture, politics, identity, and social formations are illuminated when we think critically about the African Diaspora and the forces that propel it?\n\nFall 2010 V55.0541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish & Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Morris (ISAWFALL 2010 V55.0546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Hull (History) syllabus Focuses on several major African cultures that influenced each other's development from the pre-colonial through the postcolonial eras. These multi-dimensional cultures are examined through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, and museum artifacts, with emphasis on concepts of cultural identity and interchange, modernization, and cosmopolitanism. Africa is examined not only within the context of indigenous cultures but within the context of the world at large. In this vein, we weigh the contributions African cultures made to each other but also to the wider world.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0510 Cultures and Contexts: Russia—between East and West Prof. Borenstein (Russian & Slavic Studies)syllabus What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West), or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very beginnings to the present day.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0512 Cultures and Contexts: China Prof. Button (East Asian Studies) syllabus However one might choose to define the nature of human being, no one is ever merely human. Apart from whatever common essence we may be said to share, we are always also a combination of racial, ethnic, national, and gender differences. Over the course of several millennia Chinese culture has produced different conceptions of human being. We explore the variety of ways those conceptions have changed over time. Central to our inquiry is the question of how contending visions of the human are expressed and contested in different kinds of philosophical and literary texts, as well as artistic works in other media, including visual culture and film. Our guiding focus is on how ideas about human being in China have shaped gender roles and relations, the discourses of spirituality and the supernatural, as well as modern problems of race, nationalism, and revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Rosaldo and Prof. Gaytan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Addresses immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, testimonials, identities, popular culture, and language. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws on readings from imaginative literature to social science, we explore Latino communities in the United States and the issues that divide and unite them.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0533 Cultures and Contexts: Iran Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran: For 2500 years, the culture and civilization of Iran, (known in the West prior to World War II as Persia), has survived innumerable attacks and vicissitudes, which swept away many other cultures, languages, and nations. The first empire in human history to be multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious, based on tolerance, expanded ultimately to encompass all the lands from the Hindu Kush to North Africa. Emphasizing the growth of ancient Iranian culture--particularly art, architecture, literature, and their influence--we investigate the traditional myths and religions of ancient Iran, the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness, the establishment of Shi'i Islam as the state religion, and the conflict of the vision and mysticism of traditional Iranian culture with that of the West. We survey the political organization of the Empire, Alexander the Great's conquest of Iran and its aftermath, and the impact of the Arab-Islamic conquest. We examine the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness after World War II, and the transformation of the country during the Islamic Revolution.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses0751 Expressive Culture: Television Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus The Twilight Zone and Expressive Culture of the 1950s and 1960s. According to cliché, the 1950s in America were a period of conformity and consensus, but it is clear that there were many signs of discontent with and within the image of cheerful homogeneity. For example, at the end of the decade, the television program The Twilight Zone, showed everyday life as a source of paranoia in which ordinary existence revealed its frightening underside. Then, as the nation engaged with the New Frontier of the Kennedy 1960s, the show used science fiction to represent dreams as American nightmares. We look at The Twilight Zone in terms of its expressive rendition of 1950s and 1960s America. Along the way, we examine the shift in American television from East Coast production of liberal drama to West Coast production of escapism and entertainment and will situate Rod Serling's career within that shift. We also examine other renditions of paranoia (and symbolic resolutions of it) across the popular culture and politics of the moment. Most broadly, we attempt to examine the medium of popular television as an expressive cultural form which enlightened liberals like Serling tried to use as a mode of moral and aesthetic uplift. Critical methods that might help us understand the potentials of television as expressive culture are emphasized.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa\nProf. Adams (NYU in Ghana) syllabus African culture through autobiography. Texts consist of chronological life histories and memoirs, e. g., by writers of aristocratic birth and those of peasant birth, by individuals accomplished in the arts and others in the sciences, by Nobel laureates and by political leaders, by women and by men. Each narrative provides an intimate acquaintance with the traditions, aspirations, challenges, and strategies from the writer's own society. Collectively they provide the skeleton of a usefully subjective narrative of modern African history. The depicted lives include an 18th-century enslaved Nigerian child, who, ultimately, as a free man, would become a respected abolitionist; the U.S.-educated leader of Africa's first nation to gain independence from colonialism; the passionate Kenyan crusader for the preservation of Africa's environment as the source of its self-development; and the physically and morally courageous exemplar of the battle that overthrew South African apartheid.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain—At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America\nProf. Galban (NYU in Madrid) syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain—the idea of Spain—that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain's New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933–36). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multicultural France\nProf. Epstein (NYU in Paris) syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \"race,\" identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \"ethnic community\" so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \"homogeneity\" of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \"primitive\" art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, négritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague—In the Heart of Central Europe\nProf. Mucha (NYU in Prague) syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world's richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe.

In light of this guidance, the study of Logarithmic and Exponential functions plays a very important role in secondary education, particularly in providing a way to model some of the real world problems that students meet outside of the classroom. Such problems are found in diverse places as medicine and finance, as well as, advanced mathematics and politics. More likely than not, if one asked those who studied mathematics in secondary school 25 years ago why they studied exponentials and logarithms, other than to learn about slide rule computation, many would say it was because the topic was a chapter in their textbook that had to be covered. One wonders why something that made a major impact on mathematics four centuries ago became so meaningless to the secondary students of the latter half of the 20th century, the \"new math\" era. Fortunately, textbooks which embody the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics today reward the student with the theory of exponents and logarithms along with the study of contemporary applications giving meaning to the study. In 1989, the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, which The Principles and Standards for School Mathematics were designed to build upon, were released. The document encouraged that attention be focused \"on the need for student awareness of the interaction between mathematics and the historical situations from which it has developed and the impact that interaction has on or culture and our lives\" (p.6). There is no doubt that the study of the history of exponents and logarithms is a prime example of how \"theoretical mathematics (which) has burgeoned in its diversity and deepened in its complexity and abstraction...has become more ... vital to our technologically oriented society\" (p.6). Goals of the Module: 1. To understand the historical background leading to the development of exponents, exponentials, and logarithms and to see how mathematical concepts evolve over periods of time. 2. To provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge of exponents and logarithms to various concrete situations and problems in a historical context. 3. To show students the connection between exponential functions and logarithmic functions, that is the inverse relationship they share with one another. 4. To develop in students an appreciation of the history connected with the development of exponents and logarithms.\n4\nHow to use this module: The authors realize this module contains more material than most teachers can squeeze into an already overcrowded syllabus. It is recommended that the teacher review the material and pick and choose those topics that best fit teacher and students' needs. The material can be made to fit many different types of objectives, and it can be made to fit many different lesson plans. It may even be of interest to teachers of subjects other than mathematics. General historical material may be used for group or whole class discussion. Some quotations and biographical sketches may be more appropriate for introductory material while some are best used within activities. Students should be able to locate the places mentioned on a world map. The written assignments that are required in some of the activities could also include connections with units in social studies, science, economics, etc. If more comprehensive studies are required or desired, the authors have included a bibliography for students and teachers interested in the further study of content in the module. Time Schedule Time needed will depend on the activities and materials the individual teacher chooses to use and the level of the class. The activities may be used to introduce the topic and then further work may be accomplished using exercises found in student textbooks. The teacher is in no way obliged to ask students to perform all these activities; one is not constrained to follow the suggested sequence in which the activities are listed nor to follow the teacher hints. The authors believe that the history will enable students to understand the mathematics better. It is further suggested that the mathematics teacher team teach parts of this module with a history or social science teacher, if such an arrangement can be made. Materials Needed It is highly recommended that the teacher post a world map. Other materials which may be needed in these activities are: machine tape, straightedge, compass, ruler, lined paper, graphing paper, graphing calculator or graphing utility, computers. .Classroom Organization: When using the exploratory activities and projects of this module appears to be the appropriate time to have the class organized into cooperative groups. Using a constructivist approach, the lessons have been created with questions or hints that are designed to guide the student toward \"discovering\" the relevant results. The quotations of mathematicians may be best presented to the class as a whole on overhead transparencies; copies may be made for personal study by the students.\n5\nSuggested Courses for Using Module Activities\nActivity Exponent Notation According to Newton Properties of Exponential Functions Properties of Exponents Compound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase What Will Happen If....?

Lord Moulton, The Invention of Logarithms, Its Genesis and Growth (NTV, 21) The discovery of logarithms is attributed to the Scottish mathematician John Napier; in this section, you will be able to learn about Napier's life, how he formulated the first view of logarithms, and how they were quickly transformed during his own lifetime into something different. The temptation is severe to recast all of Napier's work through the lens of our present interpretation of logarithms, but the actual story is every bit as impressive. Moulton's quote above is useful to keep in mind when we consider the path which Napier took. John Napier was born into an influential and well-to-do family in 1550 in the family estate at Murchiston Castle near Edinburgh, Scotland as the eldest son of Archibald and Janet Napier. Before his death (also at Murchiston) in 1617, he was to become a theologian and an ardent supporter of the Protestant faith, an inventor of weaponry, and an exceptional mathematician. In mathematics, he was known for his work on spherical trigonometry, his invention of an early form of a mechanical calculator, and in particular, his discovery of and work with logarithms. It is also the case that Napier's name was spelled a variety of different ways, including by himself, among them being: Napeir, Nepeir, Neper, Nepper, Naper, Napare, and Naipper. We will adopt the spelling in ordinary usage at the present time. We really know quite little about Napier's early life. It seems he was a student at University of St. Andrews, but he never earned a degree there. He may have traveled abroad, but by 1571 he had returned to the family estates in Scotland where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Stirling in 1572, and after she died in 1579, he married Agnes Chisholm. He had a son and a daughter by his first wife and five sons and five daughters by his second. At this time in Scotland, religious strive was rampant. King James VI of Scotland had designs on the English throne, and there were rumors of the involvement of King Philip II of Spain in those plans. The issue of whether Scotland would become Catholic or Protestant became a widespread concern, and Napier came down very firmly on the side of the Protestants. Scotland suffered through a civil war in 1570-72, and in 1588 the English defeated the Spanish Armada. In 1593 Napier wrote the Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John; to gain a sense of this book, consider the following quote from a letter addressed to King James which formed the dedication: \"...let it be your Majesty's continuall study...to reforme the universall enormities of your country, and first...to begin at your Majesty's owne house, familie and court, and purge the same of all suspicion of Papists and Atheists and Newtralls...\" (NTV, 42) The book was widely read; between 1593 and 1645 there were 5 English editions, 2 Dutch editions, 5 French editions, and 3 in German. In it, among other things, Napier declared the Pope to be the Antichrist and predicted \"that the day of God's judgement appears to fall betwixt the years of Christ 1688 and 1700.\"\n10\nThere is strong evidence that probably as early as 1594, Napier had begun to investigate certain properties of calculations which would make working with the trigonometric values of sines considerably easier to do in order to facilitate the computations involved in astronomy. The German mathematician Michael Stifel wrote the Arithmetica integra in 1544, and it contained a clear statement relating the arithmetic sequence of integers (1, 2, 3...) with the corresponding geometric sequence of 2 raised to those powers ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 , ...), and this may have suggested the possibility to Napier of using sums to compute products. Stifel even called the powers `exponents' and discussed what we would describe as \"when you multiply the numbers, you add the exponents.\" Napier was also visited by Dr. John Craig, a member of the Scottish royal court, who met had the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1590 and seen some of Tycho's work with prosthaphaeresis. This was a long-known method of using \"product to sum\" formulas: namely, such trigonometric identities as 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x y). Whatever the impetus, in 1614 Napier published the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) and then posthumously in 1619 the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio (Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) was published. It appears as if Napier wished his work to be as widely accessible as possible, and to this end he aided in Edward Wright's translation of the Descriptio into English in 1616. In this translation he explained that his intent with logarithms was to aid in the calculations involved in multiplication, division, and the taking of roots: Seeing Napier coined the word `logarithm' from the Greek words logos (ratio) and arithmos (number), and his original definition takes some getting used to, compared to our present interpretation of a logarithm. Keep in mind as well that he originally was working strictly with the sines of angles. In proposition 26 in the Constructio he states: \"The logarithm of a given sine is that number which has increased arithmetically with the same velocity throughout as that with which radius began to decrease geometrically, and in the same time as radius has decreased to the given sine.\" (Napier, p. 19) T b g a S i\nIn the figure above, imagine that TS is a line segment of 10 7 units, and that bi is a ray from b. (Napier chose 10 7 for his radius so that he could use values of sines accurate to 7 decimal places but treat them as integers. It is also the case that Napier was one of the first mathematicians to widely use the decimal point as we now write it to separate the integer from the decimal fractional part of a number.) A point g starts at T and moves towards S at a rate\n11\nequal to its distance from S; at the same time that g starts at T, point a starts at b and moves towards i at the same rate as g's initial velocity. The distance from b to a is then the logarithm of the length from g to S. There are some immediate conclusions that can be reached, stressing the difference from this original view of logarithms and our present perspective. Let Nap. log stand for Napier's definition. First, if g is still at T, then the point a is still at b; therefore, Nap. log 10 7 = 0 and Nap. log is a decreasing function. Second, it can be shown that Nap. log (xy) = Nap. log x + Nap. log y Nap. log 1. Recasting Napier's description in the language of differential equations and x solving, it is possible to demonstrate that Nap. log x = 10 7 log 1 7 ; however, it is critical to 10\ne\nstress that Napier did not interpret his logarithms in anything approaching the modern sense of an exponent for some given base. It may be reassuring to us to solve a differential equation to obtain something more familiar, but Napier's vision clearly did not start there. From the top of the mountain, we can see that Napier's path and our more recent path of regarding logarithms as exponents clearly both get us to the top, but the paths themselves are very, very different. Napier regarded one of the essential properties of logarithms as \"the logarithms of similarly proportioned sines are equidifferent.\" (Napier, p. 23) In other words, for a given k, log (kx) log x = log (ky) log y. This can clearly be considered, in light of the laws of logarithms ky kx which Napier himself knew, as equivalent to log = log . In another interesting side x y note, Napier's proposition 51 states: \"All sines in the proportion of two to one have 6931469.22 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) This statement is closely related to the fact that the natural logarithm of 2 is .693147180. Henry Briggs (1561 1630) was an English mathematician and professor of geometry at Gresham House, London at the time he met Napier; he went on to become the first Savilian professor of geometry at Merton College, Oxford. After having read the Descriptio, he went to Edinburgh in 1615 to meet with Napier. It is somewhat unusual in scientific history, but the two men immediately hit it off and in fact worked with each other until Napier's death in 1617. In 1617 with the publication of Logarithmorum chilias prima and in 1624 with Arithmetica logarithmica Briggs implemented the changes in Napier's logarithmic scheme that he and Napier had considered. Quoting from the preface to the Arithmetica logarithmica: That these logarithms differ from those which that illustrious man, the Baron of Merchiston, must not surprise you...concerning that matter I wrote immediately to the author himself...I journeyed to Edinburgh, where, being most hospitably received by him, I lingered for a whole month. But as we talked over the change in the logarithms he said that he had for some time been of the same opinion and had wished to accomplish it; he had however published those he had already prepared until he could construct more convenient ones if his affairs and his health would admit of it. But he was of the opinion that the change should be effected in this manner, that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and 10000000000\n12\nthat of the whole sine; which I could not but admit was by far the most convenient. (NTV, p. 126) It seems clear that Napier had already begun to consider a more accessible approach to his logarithms, and that Briggs' suggestions helped moved him in that direction. (As Napier himself observed at the end of his table of logarithms in the Constructio: \"Nothing is perfect at birth.\" (Napier, p. 87.)) Since the logarithm of 1 becomes 0, this simplifies greatly the computational algorithms that Napier had already discovered, bringing them in line with our present theorems of logarithms. In the Constructio, an appendix was included \"On the Construction of another and better kind of Logarithms, namely one in which the Logarithm of unity is 0.\" In this, Napier suggested but in fact did not do a revision of his own system, reflecting what he and Briggs had already determined would make computations with logarithms easier. Napier also observed in the Constructio that in this case, \"if two numbers with known Logarithms be multiplied together, forming a third; the sum of their Logarithms will be the Logarithm of the third\" (Napier, p. 50) (in other words, when you multiply, you add) and went on to state all the other familiar laws of logarithms which we use. He went ahead and then observed \"whence the only difficulty is in finding the Logarithms of the prime numbers\" (Napier, p. 51). Briggs went ahead with his own work after Napier's death, and the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica contain what is for all intents and purposes the first table of common logarithms i.e., base 10 logarithms. One of the sections of this module discussed how to calculate logarithms somewhat in the method of Napier and Briggs. However, to get a sense of what they went through, consider the following. In constructing his tables, Napier started with the value of his radius 10,000,000 and began successive multiplications of that by 1-10 -7 ; in more modern terms, he generated the terms of a geometric sequence whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -7 . Moulton argues that in performing this process some 100 times, Napier became aware that decreasing a number by the same ratio each time was equivalent to repeatedly decreasing a line segment by the same proportional length, possibly giving rise to Napier's definition of a logarithm. It may have also been the case that through the sheer effort of this work, Napier eventually saw the utility of having (in modern terms) log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 1, but that he needed to go through the tremendous labor of the first construction to reach that conclusion. It is therefore tempting now to claim Napier must have therefore seen that he was constructing a system where the logarithm corresponded to the necessary power of 10 needed to obtain the given number, but that again is our view from the mountain, not Napier's. After working through the first 100 terms (his first table), Napier apparently became aware of the tremendous work left, so he changed to a geometric series whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -5 . He carried this out for 50 more terms, giving a second table. He then created two other series in a third table, one having ratio 1- 1/2000 and one having ratio 1 - 1/100. Using the data he had accumulated with his three tables, he was then able to calculate the logarithm values of numbers from 10 7 to almost exactly 5 x 10 6 . It is small wonder that Napier worked on his tables for 20 years before he published them! In the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs approached the problem differently. He began with log 10 = 1 and then began taking successive square roots, using well-known algorithms for the computations needed for the roots. (For\n13\nexample, if 10 = 3.162277, then log 3.162277 = .5.) Once Briggs obtained the logarithms of the primes, it was easy, using the laws of logarithms, to then generate the values of the logarithms of composite numbers. It may be somewhat astonishing to realize the work required by Briggs to obtain, in Arithmetica logarithmica, the logarithms of all natural numbers from 1 to 20,000 and 90,000 to 100,000, carried out to 14 places. (For example, in his calculations to obtain the logarithm of 2 he took 47 successive square roots.) Adriaan Vlacq a few years later completed Briggs' work and completed a table for all integers from 1 to 100,000 to 10 decimals places. (Until recently, these tables formed the basis of all modern logarithm tables.) Napier also used his idea to construct what were called \"Napier's bones\", a mechanical multiplication table. Within 7 years, William Oughtred used Napier's ideas to construct the first rectilinear slide rules, basically the first pocket calculator. Some two hundred years after Napier's publication, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace noted that \"by shortening the labors, (Napier) doubled the life of the astronomer.\" Logarithms also present one of the instances when a given discovery must have been in the air; it now seems clear that roughly at the same time Napier was working on his own logarithms, the same essential concept occurred to the Swiss astronomer and watchmaker Joost Brgi (1552 - 1632). While the exact timing of Brgi's work is not entirely clear, he may have in fact worked on the concept before Napier did; however, it is the case that he did not publish his own tables (actually, his were tables of anti-logarithms) until 1620 in Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen. Kepler's statement on the priority issue may be of some interest: \"...(this) led the way for Justus Byrgius to the very same logarithms many years before Napier's edition, although this man, a procrastinator and guardian of his secrets, abandoned his child at birth and did not rear it for publicity.\" (Goldstine, p. 22) Brgi generated the values in his own table by starting with 10 8 and then multiplying by 1 + 10 -4 to obtain the successive terms. The ease with which the discovery of logarithms supported the massive calculations needed for astronomy and navigation generated intense interest among mathematicians. The work of Gregory of St. Vincent and his student A. A. de Sarasa by 1647 made the connection between the natural logarithm of a number a and the area bounded by the x-axis, the vertical a 1 lines x = 1 and x = a (for any a > 0) and the curve y = 1/x, what we would now call dx . x 1 (Natural logarithms are contrasted with common, or Briggsian logarithms by their base. If we use Euler's interpretation of a logarithm as the exponent of a given base, then natural logarithms use the number e = 2.718281828... as their base, while common logarithms use 10.) The Danish mathematician Nicolaus Mercator is usually credited with discovering the formula for the x2 x3 x4 expansion of the natural logarithm of x + 1 as the power series x - + - +... by 1668. 2 3 4 As early as 1664 Newton used this same idea to compute the value of the natural logarithm of 1.1 to 68 decimal places. The ground-breaking work of Newton and Leibniz in the calculus quickly suggested applications of logarithms very far indeed from Napier's original view of the technique.\n14\nIt turned out that the method that was developed to help with computational drudgery held a vital key in the new mathematics of calculus. The logarithm took on a life of its own, separate from the astonishing levels of sheer, brute arithmetic that it both replaced and which were required to establish the first logarithm tables. The logarithm continued to play a major role in computational sciences, but it had already begun to move away from its roots. As the 18th century progressed, mathematicians became increasingly aware of the necessary changes which calculus had brought to the techniques available to them, and also to the changes which were needed in their more basic structures in order to give the methods of calculus a concrete logical base. One of the more central concepts which evolved was that of a `function', namely the ability to regard an operation as the pairing of the number which was to be operated on with the number which resulted from the operation itself. In more abstract terms, it allowed mathematicians to regard the operation as an object itself, more divorced from the immediate numerical relationships. For example, while mathematicians had worked with the numerical relationships expressed in 2 2 = 4, 2 3 = 8, and so forth, they could now consider the relationship between the variables x and y in y = 2 x . This is an example of an `exponential' function, where the variable is the exponent of some positive base. Leonhard Euler, the enormously influential mathematician of the later 18th century, formulated the relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions when he defined log a b = c to be the case if and only if a c = b; therefore, y = a x was equivalent to the statement x = log a y. This was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations. It has provided a gateway into the solutions and analysis of many types of problems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to solve otherwise. An important observation therefore can be made that despite the view of many, both in the past and in present times, mathematics is indeed a changing science. A method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings. Until fairly recently, high school students versed in math and science were given a significant exposure to the computational methods which logarithms opened up and the mechanical devices which logarithms helped create. With the advent of inexpensive hand-held calculators, the computational roots of logarithms have become obsolete, yet the concepts which logarithms have led to continue to be of great utility. We need to be cautious whenever we decide a particular method or approach has reached a dead end; the history of logarithms provides an excellent example of how mathematics grows and develops new relationships for what may appear to be concepts and techniques which have been outgrown, but which can continue to provide important mathematics. It is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined. Vistas open up which are almost unimaginable until you reach the peak, and not only the path up but the ground below takes on a very different appearance. You can marvel at the difficulties of some paths and the ease of others, but it is difficult to not appreciate the sheer\n15\neffort required along any path to make it to the top, and especially for those who pioneered a particular path. So too it is with the concepts and computations of logarithms; whether it be Napier, Brgi, Briggs, or any of the multitude who followed them, we must continue to remember and appreciate their contributions and exertions. Questions: 1. In Proposition 5 of the Constructio Napier writes \"In numbers distinguished thus by a period in their midst, whatever is written after the period is a fraction, the denominator of which is unity with as many cyphers after it as there are figures after the period.\" (Napier, p. 8) What exactly does this appear to refer to? 2. In Proposition 52 Napier states \"All sines in the proportion of ten to one will have 23025842.34 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) What exactly is Napier saying in modern terms? 3. In an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes \"Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c. [or division by 2, 3, & c.].\" (Napier, p. 51) Translate the meaning of this statement into more modern terms. 4. In 1617, Napier published the Rabdologi where he described the construction and use of what are now called `Napier's bones' or `Napier's rods'. Find out what these were and what they were used for.\n16\nJohn Napier\n17\nLesez Euler, lesez Euler, c'est notre maitre a tous. Read Euler, read Euler!

True, he was very busy and so refused flatly to give me private lessons; but he gave me much more valuable advice to start reading more difficult mathematical books on my own and to study them as diligently as I could; if I cam across some obstacle of difficulty, I was given permission to visit him freely every Saturday afternoon and he kindly explained to me everything I could not understand, which happened with such greatly desired advantage that whenever he had obviated one difficulty for me, because of that ten others disappeared right away, and this undoubtedly, is the best method to succeed in mathematical subjects.

The students may work in groups or individually. If the students need extra time to finish the problems, they could be assigned as homework. It is interesting to read the way that Newton introduced exponents and the terminology that he used. It is also interesting to note that this was part of a lecture Newton gave at Cambridge University - so your students are being exposed to the type of mathematics that was available to university students in the 1680's. An additional assignment would be to have the students write the complete passage in the background information using modern terminology.

If a is a quantity, \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means a a. There will be various answers to this. Hopefully most will find it sufficient. The solution to a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3 a2b4 = 42 x 34 = 4 4 3 3 x 3 3 = 1296 It means that the a is to multiplied together 3 times: a a a It means a a a. Since he is naming the powers, like a5 as cube-square, he is adding the powers. So a8 would be square-cube-cube or maybe square-square-square-square.\n3. 4. 5.\n24\nExponent Notation According to Newton Student Page\nHistorical Background In Sir Isaac Newton's widely read Arithmetica Universalis, many beginning algebraic topics are included. One such topic is that of exponents. This activity comes directly from one of Newton's Arithmetica Universalis, which is a collection of the material covered in his lectures at Cambridge University in England in the 1680's. The following excerpts are from the 1972 translation by D. T. Whiteside from Newton's original Latin. t From page 61: If a quantity should multiply itself, for shortness the number of factors is usually appended. Thus. Here note that a number written immediately between two variables relates always to the preceding one. Thus `3' in the quantity a3b2does not signify the b2 is to be taken 3 times, but denotes that a has twice to be multiplied into itself. Note also that these quantities are said to be of as many dimensions, powers or `dignities' as they comprise factors or quantities multiplying one another, and that the number appended is called the index of their power or dimension. Thus a2 is of two dimensions or powers, while a3, as its appended number `3' indicates is of three. Also a2 is said to be the square, a3 the cube, a4 the square-square (fourth power), a5 the square-cube (fifth power), a6 the cube-cube (sixth power), a7 the square-square-cube (seventh power) and so forth. Exercises 1. Explain what \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means. 2. Is the explanation Sir Isaac Newton gave his students in the following enough for you to write terms using exponents? Give your reasons why or why not. Would you be able to evaluate a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3? \"Thus.\" 3. According to Newton what does the `3' in the expression a3b2 mean? 4. What does the phrase \"a has twice to be multiplied into itself\" mean? 5. Using Newton's method of naming powers, how would he describe the eighth power of a, a8?\n25\nProperties of Exponential Functions Teacher Notes\nThis activity is a great way to give students the opportunity to graph and observe a variety of exponential functions and then summarize their findings.

Answers will vary, but will be similar to the ones in A through C above. Students might choose negative or zero values for a. If they do, this is a good time to discuss why these values give very strange graphs, graphs which we will usually avoid. In general, in precalculus and calculus classes we generally want to talk just about continuous functions and functions whose inverses are also functions. E. Answers will vary, but will include some of the following observations. All the graphs intersect at the point (0,1). None of the graphs has negative y-values. If a > 0, as z increases, y increases. As a gets larger, the values of y increase faster as z increases. If a < 1, as z increases, y decreases. If a = 1, then y = 1; i.e. the function is constant. If a < 0, the graph jumps back and forth between positive and negative values for y as z increases. F. Answers will vary. Many students will find that their answers include some, if not all, of Euler's observations.\n28\nProperties of Exponential Functions Student Pages\nLeonhard Euler wrote the first easy-to-read precalculus book in 1748.

Look at a general exponential function, y = a z , and see what happens to the graph as the value of a changes. Use the same scale for all graphs.

Compare what you have written with the description Euler writes concisely below.\n30\nEuler gives a magnificent and clear description of an exponential function in his precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite (1748). The values of the exponential a z depend primarily on the magnitude of the constant a . If a = 1 , then we always have a z = 1 , no matter what value is given z to z . If a > 1 , then a will have a greater value if the value of z is greater than it was originally and as z goes to infinity, so also a z increases to infinity. If z = 0 , then a z = 1 ; if z < 0 , then the values of a z become less than 1 and as z goes to z - , a goes to 0. On the other hand if a < 1 but still positive, then the values of a z decrease when z increases above 0. The exponential [ a z ] increases as z 1 increases in the negative direction. Since when a < 1 , we have < 1 , and if we a 1 -z z let = b , then a = b . For this reason we can examine the case when a < 1 a from the case when a > 1 .\n31\nProperties of Exponents Teacher Notes\nThis activity gives students the opportunity to look at how a master mathematician expressed several ideas about exponents in his great precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite, published in 1748.

Chuquet's secret is the same as our answer to 8e.\n33\nProperties of Exponents Student Pages\nWhat would happen if exponents were numbers other than natural numbers? Islamic mathematicians of the 11th century were the earliest people to use negative numbers as exponents. Nicole Oresme, a French mathematician associated with the University of Paris around 1350, had some ideas about fractional exponents and even tried to explain what it would mean to have an irrational number as an exponent. In 1655, John Wallis, an English mathematician, gave a clearer explanation of fractional exponents and a few years later, Isaac Newton was able to make use of them with ease. Here, however, we look at the explanation of exponents of various types by the prolific mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748: Let the exponential to be considered be a where a is a constant and the exponent z is a variable. Since the exponent z stands for all determined numbers, it is clear at least that all positive integers can be substituted for z to give determined 1 2 3 4 5 6 values for a , a , a , a , a , a , etc. If for z we substitute the negative integers -1, -2, -3, etc. we obtain\nz\n1 1 1 1 1 1 , , , , , , etc. If z = 0, a1 a2 a 3 a4 a5 a6 then we have a0 = 1. If we substitute a fraction for z , for instance 1 1 2 1 3 , , , , , etc., we obtain 2 3 3 4 4\nthe values more values, since the extraction of roots gives several values. However, we will consider only their primary [now called principal] values, since\n1 2 1 3 a, a 3 , a 3 , a 4 , a 4 , etc. These symbols can have two or\na a and 3 a ... In like manner we let z take irrational values, even though it is more 7 difficult to understand this concept. ... Thus a has a value which lies between 2 3 a and a ...\nfrom Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite by Leonhard Euler Some statements in that selection probably look more familiar than other statements. For example, in the first sentence Euler talks about negative exponents. In the second sentence he\n1 tells about square roots so that we understand a 2\nz\n5 2 lies between is to be thought of as a ... function. For this reason. a\n2\n= a\n1 and by implication, a 3\n= 3 a , etc.\nWe can use this to help us rewrite expressions with rational exponents as expressions with radicals instead. Complete the following using Euler's idea to rewrite the expressions using radicals.\n34\n2 1 1 2 3 = a 3 = a 2 3 = _________________ 1. a\n( )\n1 2. a 4\n= _________________\n3 3. a 4 =__________________= __________________=__________________\nThe sixth and seventh sentences refer to situations such as the fact that a given positive number has two different square roots, a positive one and a negative one. But since we want to define an exponential function, we will consider only the positive value.\n5 lies between the two 2 7 successive integers 2 and 3. Finally, Euler also suggest that one can estimate the value of a when one knows that 7 lies between the two successive integers 2 and 3.\nUse this method to estimate the following by stating the numbers between which the given number lies. Example. 4\n5 2 3 2 = _______________________________________________________________ 4. 4 2 3 = a number between 4 and 4 , that is, between 16 and 64.\n5 2 , since The next sentence suggests a method to estimate the value of a\n5. 2 6. 32\n5\n= ______________________________________________________________\n4 5 = ______________________________________________________________\n3 7. 9 2 = ________________________________________________________________\nClearly this last observation by Euler does not give very precise estimates, but it is insightful!\n8. Familiar, Yet Different, Yet Related. You are a mathematics historian; you even consider yourself a detective of sorts! As you read the selection below, think about these questions: What familiar concept is being discussed? The notation looks familiar, but wait, does it have the same meaning? Or is it a little different?\n35\nNicolas Chuquet, a mathematician who taught in Lyons, France, wrote these words sometime during the fifteenth century. He invented the notation, but its meaning has evolved somewhat since then. To understand the reason why denomination of number is added to denomination, ..., it is necessary to set down several proportional numbers beginning with 1 and arranged in a continuous sequence, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. or 3, 9, 27, etc. Numbers 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 Denomination 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nNow it is necessary to know that 1 represents and is in the place of numbers, whose denomination is 0, 2 represents [...] the first terms, whose denomination is 1. 4 holds the place of the second terms, whose denomination is 2. And 8 is in the place of the third terms, 16 holds the place of the fourth terms, 32 represents the fifth terms, and so for the others. Now whoever multiplies 1 by 1, it comes to 1, and because 1 multiplied by 1 does not change at all, neither does any other number when it is multiplied by 1 increase or diminish, and for this consideration, whoever multiplies a number by a number, it comes to a number, whose denomination is 0. And whoever adds 0 to 0 makes 0. Afterwards, whoever multiplies 2, which is the first number by 1, which is a number, the multiplication comes to 2; then afterwards, whoever adds their denominations, which are 0 and 1, it makes 1; thus the multiplication comes to 21. And from this it comes that when one multiplies numbers by first terms or vice versa, it comes to first terms. Also whoever multiplies 21 by 21, it comes to 4 which is a second number. Thus the multiplication amounts to 42. For 2 multiplied by 2 makes 4 when adding the\n36\ndenominations, that is 1 with 1, makes 2. And from this it comes that whoever multiplies first terms by first terms, it comes to second terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 21 by 42, it comes to 83. For 2 multiplied by 4 and 1 added with 2 makes 83. And thus whoever multiplies first terms by second terms, it comes to third terms. Also, whoever multiplies 42 by 42, it comes to 16 which is a fourth number, and for this reason whoever multiplies second terms by second terms, it comes to fourth terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 4 which is a second number by 8 which is a third number makes 32 which is a fifth number. And thus whoever multiplies second terms by third terms or vice versa, it comes to fifth terms. And third terms by fourth terms comes to 7th terms, and fourth terms by fourth terms, it comes to 8th terms, and so for the others. In this discussion there is manifest a secret which is in the proportional numbers. It is that whoever multiplies a proportional number by itself, it comes to the number of the double of its denomination, as, whoever multiplies 8 which is a third number by itself, it comes to 64 which is a sixth.

Compound interest holds much promise for applying mathematical ideas to relatively important everyday applications, such as the amount of money an investor makes on a particular investment, a notion Americans are familiar with living in a capitalist society. The need to understand compound interest also arises in calculating the interest that accrues on credit card purchases, car, home, and boat loans, and financial investments. In the following activity, a historical example is used as a springboard to discuss compound interest. The historical context is centered on the European colonist's purchase of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Exposure to the compound interest formula is a prerequisite.) Objective: To investigate an application of exponential growth, compound interest, using an situation taken from the historical context of the Dutch \"purchase\" of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Materials: Student Page; Calculator; Graphing calculator and Internet access (optional) Time Frame: Two 45-minute class periods; extended project would be done outside of class How to Use: To begin the discussion of exponential growth and compound interest embedded in a historical context, provide students with the historical opener on an overhead transparency (see Transparency #1). Have students read and reflect on this historical situation. You might ask students to develop their own questions that arise from the historical situation presented. Be prepared to consider social and historical questions as well as mathematical related questions. A second option would be to use the guiding questions in the student activity to develop the lesson. One way to begin the lesson is to look at question 1 involving compound interest. First, it might be helpful to review the general compound interest formula. You might also show students the derivation for the general compound interest formula. It might be helpful to derive the compound interest formula using an example first. Then show the students the formal algebraic derivation for the compound interest formula. Consider the following example involving compound interest. You have $100. You want to invest your money in a fund that guarantees 8% interest compounded quarterly over six years. You have the following given information: r = 8% = 0.08 annual interest rate t=6 time in years\n38\nn=4 number of compounding periods per year nt = 24 number of compounding periods P = $100 principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods Because we are looking for the total amount of money at the end of 24 periods, we want to find S 24 . Guide the students through the derivation using the above given information. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is 0.08 S1 = 100 + 100 = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is 0.08 2 S 2 = S1 + S1 = S1 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02)(1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the third compounding period is 0.08 2 3 S3 = S 2 + S2 = S 2 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 Explain to your students that we are looking for S 24 ; that is, the total amount of money we have accumulated at the end of the 24th period. Next guide students to the algebraic derivation of the general compound interest. We have the following given information: r = annual interest rate t = time in years n = number of compounding periods per year nt = total number of compounding periods P = principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods r = interest rate per compounding period n nt = total number of compounding periods. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is r r S 1 = P + P = P 1 + n n\n39\nThe total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is r r r r r r r S 2 = S1 + S1 = P1 + + P1 + = P1 + 1 + = P1 + . n n n n n n n The total amount of money we have at the end of the nt -th compounding period is S nt = P1 + r . n\nnt 2\nUsing the derivation of the general compound interest formula, lead students to the exponential equation that describes the situation described in the historical opener. Let P = 24, r = 7%, n = 1 (compounded annually) and t = 372 (the number of years since 1626 this is being calculated for the year 1998) r y = S nt = P1 + n 0.07 y = 241 + 1\nnt\n(1)( 372 )\ny = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410\nGuide your students to discover that the initial formula for y represents an exponential growth function of the form, f ( x) = ab x where a is the initial amount of money, b is the growth factor, and x is the total number of compounding periods. Stress that because b > 1 in compound interest problems, then the function is an example of exponential growth. Guide students to change a and b in f(x) = abx to see the effect on the curve. Encourage students to examine the function for a > 0, a < 0, b >1, and 0 < b < 1 and to write a complete explanation of the results they found. Have students solve additional examples of exponential growth problems either using variations on the historical opener problem or problems from a textbook. Give students an opportunity to create their own problems and to explain them to the class.\n40\nCompound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase Solutions\n1. As indicated above, y = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410 2. The 3.8 billion dollars is less than the amount found in number 1, so perhaps, Minuit paid too much, or the interest rate is too high, or the tax assessment value is too low. 3. Minuit should have paid a great deal more. Land in the Old World was dear and certainly, an equivalent amount of land, in say Holland or England, would have been very expensive. But given that the amount found in number 1 is higher than the tax valuation in number 2, find a payment that would give the tax valuation. This time solve for the initial amount given that the final amount is 3.8 billion dollars and the interest rate is 7% with 372 years (this solution is being done in 1998) with annual compounding yields: 3.8 10 = a(1.07)\n9 372\n3.8 10 9 a= .044567 or about 4.5cents.

This famous mathematics book was written by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in the middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that this problem appears in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum shows that issues of population growth were of concern to the people living in the eighteenth century. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. However, this activity is designed to solve the problem using exponential functions first. Later, when logarithms and logarithmic functions are developed in the module, you can show students how to solve this problem using logarithms. Showing students how to solve this problem using both exponential and logarithmic functions provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the inherent connection between exponential and logarithmic functions. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objectives: To develop students' understanding of exponential growth functions by using a problem of population growth taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum, which was written in the middle eighteenth century.

It helps explain why a mathematical model may need to change with the passing decades. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry (Prerequisites: Using various regression equations on a graphing utility to describe data) Objective: To study various regression equations culminating in the need for the logistic equation to model real-world data Materials: Overhead projector; transparency made from the Population Data; Graphing calculators with regression equation capabilities, including the logistic function Time Frame: One class period How to Use: This activity works very well as a teacher-guided discussion with the everexpanding data set being modeled by successive functions. It helps the students see that as more and more data is available a model may need to change in order to make better predictions. 1. Perhaps begin by asking students which statistics about New York City might be valuable and why. Lead them to realize that population trends might prove useful in city planning in such areas as number and size of schools, sewage treatment and garbage collection, road construction and maintenance. 2. Using the historical information in the lesson discuss past efforts in history to solve similar prediction problems. 3. Ask students to look at the initial data set and imagine that they are city planners for NYC after the 1820 census and that they need to predict the population for the next few decades. Have them enter the data into lists on their calculators or computers, make a scatterplot of the data and fit an appropriate regression function to the data. Then have them predict the population for the next decade. 4. Ask students to pretend that a couple decades have passed and ask if their prediction was good for 1840. Now have them add this data to their previous lists, make another scatterplot incorporating all the data from 1790 through 1880, choose an appropriate regression function and predict the population for the next decade. Some students may try a quadratic regression function. It actually appears to fit the data better than the exponential function. You may want to tell them that fitting the data is not the only criterion for choosing a particular regression equation. For example, the quadratic function would imply that at first the population of NYC would decrease during the first decade under consideration. While that is\n54\npossible, it doesn't fit the real data that is ever increasing. They may point out that the exponential function overestimates the population in the final decade of this data set. That will point the way to needing a different regression function, a suspicion that is confirmed by the next data set. 5. For the third data set, after plotting additional points, students may suggest that it is composed of several parts, such as exponential for the first third, quadratic for the second third, and logarithmic for the final third. You can then suggest that this S-shape is characteristic of the logistic function and students may use their TI-83 graphing calculators to fit a regression function to the data. 6. For the final data set, after plotting the additional points, students may decide it is best described as a cubic function, but you may want to point out that a cubic equation would have predicted a negative population for the first three decades of the 1800's. 7. A discussion of possible reasons why the population growth rate slows down in the final set is a lively finale to this activity. Students may bring up such possibilities as population density, insufficient water/sewage treatment plants, insufficient medical services for a greater population, not enough roads or public transportation, not enough schools to support a greater population.

We will also consider the entire concept of using mathematics to model a real-world situation. An important use of mathematics is its ability to take current numerical information, or data, and then make predictions of future behavior based on that data. A useful field of investigation is that of population growth, with its obvious impact on city planning, environmental concerns, allocation of resources, and many other areas. Data from previous years can indicate important trends; social scientists, economists, and many other professionals have discovered that one can also use data to predict future growth patterns. We will use data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census on the population of New York City to investigate three different predictive models. One simple possibility for population growth is that the growth is constant; in other words, that the population grows by the same amount each year. The population can then be depicted mathematically with an \"arithmetic\" sequence, a sequence of numbers where any two successive terms differ by the same amount. An example of an arithmetic sequence is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17... A more complicated model uses the premise that the growth is proportional to the present population; in other words, the larger the population, the more people are added each year. In this situation, we often say that the growth rate, say r%, is constant. The population in this case can be represented by a \"geometric\" sequence, one where any two successive terms have the same ratio. An example of a geometric sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... A third model uses the idea that the growth of the population will be proportional to two factors: the current population and also how close the population gets to some ceiling or maximal size. This model implies that initial growth may be faster, but as the constraints of resources come into play, then the growth will slow down. The full mathematical development of these three models requires techniques of calculus, and therefore we will not dwell unnecessarily on the methods used to obtain the equations. However, we can briefly summarize the central mathematical conclusions. In the first model the population y will be a linear function of time t, that is, the population y will be given by the familiar formula y = mt + b. The second model results in an exponential model of growth, in which the population y is expressed by y = y 0 e rt where y 0 is some given initial value, r is the rate, t is the time and e is the familiar 2.718... The third model results in the logistic model of c , where for the additional variables, c represents the maximal population growth, y = 1 + ae ( - bt ) which can be sustained (called the \"carrying capacity\") and a and b are constants which emerge from a particular set of data.\n56\nLet's consider the use of these three models with the same overall set of data, restricted to different time periods. The U. S. Bureau of the Census contains a myriad of information about populations of various segments of the United States from 1790 until the present. (The Constitution of the United States orders that a count of the population be held every 10 years in order to correctly apportion the seats in the House of Representatives; this raw data can then be used in variety of ways to gain interesting information about patterns of growth in the U. S.) One such set of information is the population of New York City as measured every 10 years in the Census. For the period of 1790 to 1820, the Census gives the following counts: Year Population 1790 33,131 1800 60,515 1810 96,373 1820 123,706\nUsing your graphing calculator, plot those four points using the Year as the x-coordinate and the Population as the y-coordinate and a suitable viewing rectangle; you should obtain something which resembles Chart 1. It should be pretty clear that these four data points look like they almost fall on a line; you can use the capabilities of your particular calculator to discover the regression equation line which will fit the data which gives you an answer of y = 3075.83x 5,473,441.9. Graph that equation over the set of data to observe how good a fit it is. However, you test a model by not only how well it fits given data but also how well it will predict the future. The count for 1830 was 202,589, and the count for 1840 was 312,710. According to the equation above you should expect the count for 1830 to be 155,327 and the count for 1840 to be 186,085; clearly, the mathematical model is at odds with the real data. The linear model does not account for the complexity of the information and significantly undercounts the real population. Let's consider more of the set of data next; to the data given above for 1790 to 1820, expand the data set to include the following through 1880: Year Pop. 1830 202,589 1840 312,710 1850 515,547 1860 813,669 1870 942,292 1880 1,206,299\nGraphing these in a suitable viewing rectangle should yield something resembling Chart 2. This graph should look like the graph of an exponential function, examples of which you have already seen. You can again use the capabilities of your calculator to obtain an exponential function that fits the data, yielding y = (11162 10 -27 )e .040578 x . Graph that function over the data set, and . again note the fit. Using our previous approach, the census count for 1890 was 1,515,301 and the count for 1900 was 3,437,202; our equation predicts that the figure for 1890 should be 2,265,258 and for 1900 it should be 3,398.969. The exponential equation fits the given data well, but again it is less useful when we try to expand it to cover a broader scope. Now we will consider more data; we expand the data set to include the population through 1950:\n57\n1890 1,515,301\n1900 3,437,202\n1910 4,766,883\n1920 5,620,048\n1930 6,930,446\n1940 7,454,995\n1950 7,891,957\nGraph the population from 1790 through 1950, and note how the graph initially increases very rapidly, but then levels off and increases much more slowly. Compare your graph to Chart 3. This `S' shape is highly suggestive of the model of logistic growth. If your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y = . Again, map this function 1 + (12224 10 50 )e ( -.060438 x ) . over the data set, and observe the fit. To get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it. Notice how the curve flattens out. What is the implication of such a graph? Now, let's consider the full range of data through the 1990 census. Include in your data the following: Year Population 1960 7,781,984 1970 7,894,862 1980 7,071,639 1990 7,322,564\nThe graph of the full set of data is in Chart 4; make sure your graph is similar. Note the strong fit of the curve through the data of 1950, and then how the curve fails to model the data, particularly in 1980 and 1990. Some conclusions: The first matter for us to consider here is the history of some of these models. The simplest concept of growth is one that results in an arithmetic pattern; early scientific consideration of population growth of crops and domesticated animals demonstrated this model was not sufficient to explain the observed growth. Thomas Malthus (1766 1834) was an English clergyman and political economist who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. In there, he wrote that \"population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio.\" When this idea was investigated mathematically, it resulted in the exponential model expressed above. Pierre Francois Verhulst (1804 1849) was a Belgian mathematician and statistician who is credited with first writing about the logistic model of growth in 1845, when he attempted to take into account factors, such as limited resources, that would also tend to slow down growth after time. (Our logistic equation is written in the form y = f(t); Verhulst wrote it in the form t = h(y). This form requires the use of logarithms, and apparently he coined the word `logistic' to suggest the connection between the curve and the characteristic shape of a logarithm.) Next, we need to consider the whole concept of a model in and of itself. First, one point is to recognize that while a mathematical model may fit a particular set of data, it is a somewhat dangerous perspective to feel that the model will always work. We considered three models linear, exponential, and then logistic which did a reasonable job with one set of data, but then became less accurate as the data encompassed a larger time frame. There is a danger in assuming that we can ever exactly describe a living situation with a mathematical model. There are\n58\ntechniques of chaos theory that we could call on to account for the fluctuations in the data we considered in the periods of time following 1950, but what is to say that the future data will fit this model as well? It may be that all we can ever hope for is a rough description of a living entity without ever attaining any sort of permanent exactness. Second, mathematics expands to generate more sophisticated techniques as more data is made available. Malthus had a reasonable perspective, given his time; Verhulst developed a better one, but not necessarily because he was somehow smarter he had access to more information. Complicated models require equally complicated mathematics even to obtain approximate correlation with real-world data. We can even incorporate the new field of chaos theory to further refine our model. Third, we need to be careful about assuming that just because we can describe a set of data mathematically, we have somehow discovered what is creating the data. The Americans Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed independently rediscovered Verhulst's analysis of population growth in 1920. They cautioned: \"No process of empirically graduating raw data with a curve can in and of itself demonstrate the fundamental law which causes the occurring change.\" In other words, do not mistake an ability to describe a set of data with a mathematical formula with understanding what is creating the data itself. It may be that the mathematics helps us to see some underlying principles, but the ability to extrapolate the future from a set of data is at best an inexact procedure. However, in the article which they wrote to discuss the mathematics of logistic growth and its application to population modeling, Reed and Pearl concluded: \"...the hypothesis here advanced as to the law of population growth [that of logistic growth]...so closely describes the known facts regarding the past history of that growth, as to make it potentially profitable to continue the mathematical development and refinement of the hypothesis further.\" It may still be very useful for us to study the particular model, realizing that we still do not have a full mathematical description of the phenomena being studied. In an article appearing in the March, 1998 edition of the journal Primus on the logistic curve, Bonnie Shulman warns that while the difference between the mathematics of a model and the underlying dynamics may be clear to mathematicians, \"important policy decisions are made based on the predictions arising from models.\" It is perfectly understandable that we would use mathematical models to try to predict the future, but those predictions must always be taken with a sense of caution. Biologists have studied population growth of various species extensively, and as such have repeatedly come across examples of logistic growth. Even at that, in Population Biology of Plants, John L. Harper states: \"The logistic curve remains central to population biology, not because it describes how populations behave but rather because it provides a standard base of ideal behavior against which the reality can be judged and measured.\" (Harper, p. 3.)\n59\nChart 1:\n150000 100000 50000 0 1790 1795 1800\n1790-1820\n1805 year\n1810\n1815\n1820 Series1\nChart 2:\n1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 600000 400000 200000 0 1780 1790 1800 1810 1820\n1790-1880\nSeries1\n1830 year\n1840\n1850\n1860\n1870\n1880\nChart 3:\n8000000 7000000 6000000 5000000 4000000 3000000 2000000 1000000 0 1750 1800\n1790-1950\nSeries1\n1850 year\n1900\n1950\n60\n1790 1800 1810 1820 1830 1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920\n33131 60515 96373 123706 202589 312710 515547 813669 942292 1206299 1515301 3437212 4766883 5620084\n61\nNewton's Law of Cooling Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: In this activity students read a little history behind Newton's Law of Cooling as well as using it. An experiment using the CBL to collect data and then mathematics to analyze it could be incorporated here as well; many books, such as the Texas Instruments book by Chris Brueningsen relating mathematics and science using the CBL collection device, are available. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exponential and logarithmic functions; Solving exponential and logarithmic equations; Best fit curves (optional) Objective: The goal of this activity is to give students an opportunity to learn the history behind Newton's Law of Cooling and then to use this law in several exercises. Materials: Graphing calculator; Internet access (optional) Time Frame: This activity can be completed in one class period with the exercises started in the class, the rest to be assigned as homework. The amount of time needed for this activity may be decreased or increased depending on the mathematical level of your students. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss the history of Newton's Law of Cooling with the class after the students have had time to read the information. It might be necessary to do several examples of solving exponential and logarithmic equations before assigning this activity. If additional activities are desired, the teacher should visit the cited websites (or others that may be available) to determine the appropriateness for his/her class. Additionally, if the teacher decides to run an experiment using CBL equipment, there would need to be additional preparation on the part of the teacher. Bibliography: 1. Edwards, G. H. and David E.

Substituting T0 = 340, T(1) = 100, and Tm = 70 into Newton's Law of Cooling gives: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 100 = 70 + (340 - 70)e k (1) 30 = 270e k 30 = ek 270 1 1 = e k ln = k . 9 9 1 k can be left in this form, or it can be evaluated : k = ln -2.1972 9 kt ln(1/9)t ln(1/9) t t b. First notice that e = e = (e ) = (1/9) . Now substitute the values into Newton's Law of Cooling T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 1 80 = 70 + (340 - 70) 9 1 10 = 270 9 10 1 = 270 9\nt t t\n3 1 1 1 1 = = 3 = 2t t = hours. 2 27 9 3 3 2. This time the Tm is the unknown. T0 = 200, T(10) = 150 and k = -0.05. Substituting into Newton's Law of Cooling yields: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5(10) 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5 Multiply both sides by e0.5 . 150e0.5 = Tm e0.5 + 200 - Tm\nt\n3\n2t\n63\n150e0.5 + 200 = Tm (e0.5 - 1) 150e0.5 + 200 Tm = 72.92 e0.5 - 1 3. a. Using the points (0,0) and (34,100), the slope, m, of the line is m= 100 - 0 50 = . 34 - 0 17\nThe equation of the line relating the linseed oil temperatures to the centigrade temperatures is 50 C = N 17 b. If we substitute into the previous formula, we get C = 50 (1 2 ) 3 5 .2 9 17\nThis value is lower than the 37 C that we use. c. Again, substituting the given value for N gives us 50 C= (71) 208.82 17 Newton's value is lower than the actual value. d. There are several possible explanations. One is that Newton's values were approximations; another is that the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures is not linear. A suggested additional activity would be to use the three points (0,0), (12, 37) and (34, 100) in a different model a best fit line or a quadratic equation, for example. And then see how the new model works with the melting point of tin.\n64\nNewton's Law of Cooling Student Pages\nHistory\nBesides discovering calculus, Newton experimented in chemistry and alchemy. One of the Newton results discovered is what is now called Newton's Law of Cooling. He wrote anonymously \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\" in the 1701 volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Due to Newton's fame, Roger Cotes easily deduced that Newton was the author of the anonymous paper. Using a linseed oil thermometer, because linseed oil has a high boiling point of 240 C, Newton studied the melting points of various metals and alloys. Newton devised a method for measuring temperatures of up to 1000 C. his law of cooling. Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate at which the temperature T(t) changes in a cooling body is proportional to the difference between the temperature in the body and constant temperature Tm of the surrounding medium. If one writes this statement as a differential equation and solves, one gets Newton's Law of Cooling in the form T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)ekt where T0 is the initial temperature of the heated body at time t = 0 and where k is a constant which depends on the item being cooled. Notice that this equation is an example of exponential decay decay since k turns out to be negative because the body's temperature is decreasing.\n65\nExercises: 1. When a cake is removed from the oven, it is 340. One hour later, it has cooled to 100. If the temperature of the room is 70, a. find the constant k in Newton's Law of Cooling; b. find how long will it take for the cake to cool to 80? 2. Suppose the constant k Newton's Law of Cooling -0.05. If the temperature of a cup of coffee is 200 when it is poured and 150 10 minutes later, how warm is the room? 3. According to Newton's paper, \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\", he chose the following temperatures using his linseed oil thermometer: the freezing temperature of water was 0 and the boiling point of water was 34. The Celsius temperature for the freezing of water is 0 and the boiling point of water is 100. a. Find the linear equation that represents the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures. Let the linseed oil temperatures be the independent variable. b. Newton said that body temperature using his linseed oil thermometer was 12. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for body temperature. How does this compare with the 37 C that we use? c. Newton found that the melting point of tin was 71. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for the melting point of tin. According to the Smithsonian Physical Tables, the melting point of tin is 232 C. How does this compare with Newton's value? d. From the two examples you just did, how would you explain the discrepancies between the linseed oil thermometer values that Newton obtained, and the Celsius values that we use?\n66\nEuler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: This activity highlights a mathematical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum of 1748. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objective: To develop students' understanding of exponential functions by using a problem taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator; Graphing calculator (optional) Time Frame: One 45-minute class period How to Use: Consider using cooperative groups to do this activity. At the very least, consider pairing up students to work on this activity. If students have not had much work with exponential functions, you might need to help them find the Have students consider the following historical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's highly influential pre-calculus book, Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, written in 1748: If the progression 2, 4, 16, 256, ... is formed by letting each term be the square of the preceding term, find the value of the twenty-fifth term. This example comes from Chapter VI: On Exponentials and Logarithms of Euler's book.. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. We simply want to graph the curve that models this progression. It is preferable to have students graph this curve using a graphing calculator. If there is no access to graphing calculators, have students make a table of values and graph the exponential function on graph paper. A suggested window for graphing is x: (0, 10) and y: (0, 300). Students must first determine the function that models this progression. The students should arrive at\ny = f ( x) = 2 2 .\nx\n67\nA sample table the students may make is as follows:\nx 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7At this time, students should find the twenty-fifth term is\n) f (25 = 22 = 216,777,216.\nStudents will quickly discover this expression cannot be evaluated on a calculator. It is important to stress that Euler solved the problem using logarithms--a topic that will be discussed later and connected with exponential functions. This example is a prelude to logarithmic functions--the inverse of exponential functions. Once the students have discovered the function and curve that modeled Euler's original problem, you can discuss the relationship between this function and the standard exponential function\n24\ny = f ( x) = 2 x.\nThen have the students make a comparison between the two functions. Note: Euler's original solution with logarithms to this example is provided (See Logarithmic Functions: Euler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Revisited). Later in the unit when you introduce logarithms, it would be appropriate to revisit this problem and show students its connection to logarithms and Euler's logarithmic solution. This will make students aware of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard, translated. by John D. Blanton.

Level: Precalculus. A prerequisite is the Binomial Theorem and the calculation of e as in the section \"What Will Happen If...\" Objective: To show how to calculate the power series for ex Time Frame: One or two class periods, with a homework assignment at the end. How to Use: This is a teacher-directed lesson. The Student Pages should be given to the students, but the teacher will need to present this material and answer questions about it.\n73\nCalculating ex Student Pages\nWe present here a method of calculating ex by means of a power series, a polynomial of \"infinite degree.\" We first recall the Binomial Theorem: (a + b) n = a n + na n -1b + n(n - 1) n- 2 2 n(n - 1)n - 2) n -3 3 a b + a b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nYou should make up several examples of this for practice. In particular, note that the formula is somewhat simpler when a = 1. We then have (1 + b) n = 1 + nb + n(n - 1) 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2) 3 b + b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nNext, recall the result, discussed in an earlier section of this module, that e can be found by considering the expression 1 1 + n\nn\nand letting n get larger and larger. Today, we generally write this as 1 e = lim 1 + . n n This means simply that as we let n get larger and larger, the given expression gets closer and closer to a particular number, which we have called e. Euler, however, writing before the notion of limit had been explained, would simply write 1 e = 1 + , n where n is an infinitely large number. Today, we do not generally use such concepts, and probably Euler himself knew that such numbers did not really exist. But what he meant by the phrase \"infinitely large number\" was simply a very very very large number; he used his intuition then to determine what properties such very very very large numbers would have. We will see some of these properties as we work through his argument.\nn n\n74\n1 Since e = 1 + , where n is infinitely large, we can also calculate e r . First, we note n that if n is infinitely large and r is a finite quantity, then n/r is also infinitely large. We can therefore rewrite e as 1 e = 1 + n/r It follows that\nn/r 1 . e = 1 + n / r r r n/r\nn\n.\nBy one of the basic rules for exponents, we can rewrite this in the form 1 e = 1 + . n/r\nr n\nBut we know that\n1 r = .. We therefore have, finally, n/r n r er = 1 + , n\nn\nagain where n is infinitely large. r . Of n course, we know that the binomial theorem is only valid for finite values of n, but we will assume that it is also true when n is infinitely large. After all, we are thinking of such values n simply as very very very large positive integers. However, since we do not know how large n actually is, we will only calculate the first few terms of the binomial expansion and use dots to indicate that this expression simply goes on for a long long time. Technically, this \"infinite polynomial\" is called a power series. We now apply the binomial theorem to this last expression, taking a = 1 and b = We get\n75\nr e = 1 + n\nr\nn\nr n(n - 1) r n(n - 1)(n - 2) r n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) r = 1+ n + + + + 1 2 n 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 n n n = 1+ r + n(n - 1)r 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2)r 3 n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)r 4 + + + 1 2n 2 1 2 3n3 1 2 3 4n 4\n2\n3\n4\nWe want to simplify the various terms of this expression. So we have to use a property of ``infinitely large numbers.'' In particular, we note that if n is infinitely large, subtracting 1 n -1 from n will have no appreciable result. Thus = 1 . Similarly, if we subtract 2 or 3 or indeed n any finite number from n, this will not really change that infinitely large number. We therefore n-k = 1 for any finite number k. What this means, then, is that in the expression above, have n the quantities n, n 1, n 2, n 3, ... in the numerators always \"cancel\" the factors of n in the denominators. It follows that our expression reduces to er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ( k - 1) k is usually called\nYou may know that if k is any integer, the expression 1 2 3\nr\nk factorial and is written k! Thus, our expression for e , usually called its power series expansion, is written as er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 2! 3! 4!\nThe value of the power series expansion for Euler was that it enabled him to calculate values for e r . In particular, he could calculate the value for e1 = e . We can do it as well, by substituting r = 1 into the series. We get e = 1+1+ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + + + + 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = 1+1+ + + + + + + + 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.166666667 + 0.041666667 + 0.008333333 + 0.001388889 + 0.000198413 + 0.000024802 + 2.718278771 2.71828\n76\nYour calculator can, of course, calculate e as well as e r , for any r in a fraction of a second. You may wonder how it does it. Although different calculators use different procedures for doing this, one of the ways your calculator may work is, in fact, by using the series for e r ,. Your calculator is basically hard-wired to perform additions and multiplications; since calculating with a power series just involves these operations, all that has to happen is that the calculator must perform very many of these operations very quickly. And that is precisely what it can do. Although a normal graphing calculator can probably only calculate e to 10 decimal places, it has been calculated to far more places by a computer. The first 100 decimal places are as follows: e 2.71828 18284 59045 23535 02874 71352 66249 77572 47093 69995 95749 66967 62772 40766 30353 54759 45713 82178 52516 64274 Like another important number , the number e is irrational and even transcendental. The first statement was proved by Euler in 1737. That e is transcendental, that is, that it cannot be a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, was proved in 1873 by Charles Hermite. Interestingly, these two important numbers are closely related, as we will see in the next activity. Exercises: 1. Use your calculator to determine the decimal form of the next three terms in the series for e, namely, 1/9, 1/10, and 1/11. Add these values to the value already calculated and check that you now have e calculated correctly to 8 decimal places. 2. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1. Namely, replace r by 0.1 in that series and evaluate using your calculator. Check that using the terms through the fifth power term gives you accuracy to 8 decimal places. 3. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. 4. Use the power series for e r to calculate e1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. How many terms do you need to use to get e1 to 8-place accuracy?\n77\nEquations using e Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: Students are intrigued by e and want to know more about where it is used.

Many students will answer parabola. 2. e is the basis of natural logarithms and is used in many real-life applications, such as population growth or radioactive decay. i is the -1 which is used for complex numbers and in many real-life applications, such as electricity. is used, for example, in the area formula for a circle and volume formulas for cylinders, cones and circles. 1 is the identity element for multiplication, just to name one reason it is special. 0 is a place holder, just to name one reason it is special.\n79\nEquations using e Student Pages\n1. Hanging link chains and two brothers Imagine a chain made of identical links, hanging from the two endpoints. You've probably seen such a curve as a barrier around a grassy plot or the wire suspended from telephone poles along a highway. Sketch below the shape of the curve formed by the chain. What shape does the curve look like? ________________________________\nYou are not alone in thinking about this. Over three hundred years ago two brothers of the famous Bernoulli family of mathematicians tried to figure out the equation that described it. In May, 1691, Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem in a scientific journal, Acta Eruditorum. A year later his younger brother Johann as well as two other famous mathematicians, Christian Huygens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, correctly solved this problem. In fact Jakob Bernoulli was not able to solve it; he and his brother Johann had a strong rivalry as shown in this letter from Johann to a friend. \"You say that my brother proposed this problem; that is true, but does it follow that he had a solution of it then? Not at all. When he proposed this problem at my suggestion (for I was the first to think of it), neither the one nor the other of us was able to solve it; we despaired of it as insoluble, until Mr. Leibniz gave notice to the public in the Leipzig journal of 1690, p. 360, that he had solved the problem but did not publish his solution, so as to give time to other analysts, and it was this that encouraged us, my brother and me, to apply ourselves afresh. The efforts of my brother were without success; for my part, I was more fortunate, for I found the skill (I say it without boasting, why should I conceal the truth?) to solve it in full.... The next morning, filled with Joy, I ran to my brother, who was still struggling miserably with this Gordian knot without getting anywhere, always thinking like Galileo that the catenary was a parabola. Stop! Stop! I say to him, don't torture yourself anymore to try to prove the identity of the catenary with the parabola, since it is entirely false.\" quoted from e the Story of a Number, p. 141 Actually this curve is called a catenary from the Latin word catena meaning chain. The equation e ax + e - ax that describes the catenary is y = where a is a constant that is determined by the 2a density of the chain and the tension as it is held. Calculus is required to prove that this is correct.\n80\n2. The Most Beautiful Equation\ne i + 1 = 0\nMany consider this to be one of the most beautiful equations ever discovered since it incorporates five of the special numbers of mathematics. It was discovered by Leonhard Euler, a mathematician who studied and contributed to many different branches of mathematics. Why is each of the five numbers special in mathematics?\ne _______________________________________________________________ i _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________\n1________________________________________________________________ 0________________________________________________________________ To Benjamin Pierce, one of Harvard's leading mathematicians in the nineteenth century, this formula of Euler came as something of a revelation. Having discovered it one day, he turned to his students and said: \"Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means.

Yes 3. \"a\" is the base of the logarithm and it must be a number greater than 1. 4. The domain is positive real numbers, if the logarithm is to be real also. Part 2 5. If y = 1 in az = y, then az = 1 which implies that z = 0. But a0 = 1 corresponds to loga 1 = 0. 6. By definition, a1 = a loga a= 1, a2 = a2 loga a2 = 2, ..., an = an loga an = n 7. Since a is a positive number, 1/a, 1/a2, ... will also be positive. 1/a, 1/a2,...are less than one since the reciprocal of a positive number greater than one is a positive number less than one. (There are other explanations.) loga 1/a = loga a-1 and by the definition of logarithms, loga a-1 = y ay = a-1. Therefore, y = -1 = loga a-1. The same argument holds for the other logarithms. Part 3 8. Power rule: log yn = nz Product rule: log vy = x + y = log v + log y Quotient rule: log (y/v) = z x = log y log v 9. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. vy = axaz = ax+z so log vy = x + y. It follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. 10. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. v/y = ax /az = ax-z so log v/y = x - y. It follows that log v/y = x - y = log v - log y. Hence, the logarithm of the quotient of two numbers is equal to the difference of the logarithms of the factors.\n84\n11. If you know the logarithm of 2 and the logarithm of 3, you know the logarithms of 6 = (2)(3), 9 = 32, 27 = 33,... , 4 = 22, 8 = 23, ..., 1.5 = 3/2, 2/3, ... 36 = 2232,...and an infinite number of other examples using just these two values. See the Student Activity Calculation of Logarithms - Using the Method of Napier and Briggs for more examples. Part 4 12. The only way for the value of a logarithm to be rational is if the number is a power of the base. There are many examples: log4 8 = 3/2 (since 8 = 43/2, i.e. 8 is a power of the base 4). 13. A surd is the square root of a number that is not a perfect square such as 2 , 5 , 7 ,...\n14 Part 5 15. The rule usually looks like this: log a n = 16. loga n = p ap = n logb n = q bq = n log10 n log10 a ap = bq a = bq/p\nSince b, p and q are all constant, a is also a constant and this value has nothing to do with n, the number whose logarithm we are evaluating. 17. Looking for log2 n = q, log10 n = p (we would know this value, since it is a base 10 logarithm) log102 = 0.3010300, also log2 2 = 1 Then p/q= 0.3010300 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277p. So, if every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2. Note that this is equivalent to the usual method you gave in number 15: log10 n log10 n = = (3.3219277) log10 n log 2 n = log10 2 .3010300\n85\nIntroduction to Logarithms Student Pages\nPart 1 Read paragraph 102.

On Exponentials and Logarithms\n102. Just as, given a number a, for any value of z, we can find the value of y [= az], so, in turn, given a positive value for y, we would like to give a value for z, such that az = y. This value of z, insofar as it is viewed as a function of y, it is called the LOGARITHM of y. The discussion about logarithms supposes that there is some fixed constant to be substituted for a, and this number is the base for the logarithm. Having assumed this base, we say the logarithm of y is the exponent in the power az such that az = y. It has been customary to designate the logarithm of y by the symbol log y. If az = y, then z = log y. From this we understand that the base of the logarithms, although it depends on our choice, still it should be a number greater than 1. Furthermore, it is only of positive numbers that we can represent the logarithm with a real number. 103. Whatever logarithmic base we choose we always have log1 = 0, since in the equation az = y, which corresponds to z = log y, when we let y = 1 we have z = 0. From this it follows that the logarithm of a number greater than 1 will be positive, depending on the base a. Thus log a = 1, log a2 = 2, log a3 = 3, log a4 = 4, etc. and, after the fact, we know what base has been chosen, that is the number whose logarithm is equal to 1 is the logarithmic base. The logarithm of a positive number less than 1 will be negative. Notice that log 1/a = -1, log 1/a2 = -2, log 1/a3 = -3, etc., but the logarithms of negative numbers will not be real, but complex, as we have already noted. 104. In like manner if log y = z, then log y2 = 2z, log y3 = 3z, etc., and in general log yn = nz or log yn = n log y, since z = log y. If follows that the logarithm of any power of y is equal to the product of the exponent and the logarithm of y. For example logy = (z) = (log y), log1/y = log y-1/2 = -(log y), and so forth. It follows that if we know the logarithms of any number, we can find the logarithms of any power of that number. If we already know the logarithms of two numbers, for example log y = z and log v = x, since y = az and v = ax, it follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. In like manner log (y/v) = z x = log y log v, that is, the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished by the logarithm of the denominator. These rules can be used to find the logarithms of many numbers from a knowledge of the logarithms of a few. 105. From what we have seen, it follows that the logarithm of a number will not be a rational number unless the given number is a power of the base a. That is, unless the number b is a power of the base a, the logarithm of b cannot be expressed as a rational number. In case b is a power of the base a, then the logarithm of b cannot be an irrational number. If, indeed, log b =\n90\nn, then an = b, but this is impossible if both a and b are rational. It is especially desirable to know the logarithms of rational numbers, since from these it is possible to find the logarithms of fractions and also surds 107. There are as many different systems of logarithms as there are different numbers which can be taken as the base a. It follows that there are an infinite number of systems of logarithms. Given two different systems of logarithms, there is a constant which relates the logarithms of the same number. If. If the logarithms of all numbers have been computed in one system, then it is an easy task, by means of this golden rule for logarithms, to find the logarithms in any other system. For example, we have logarithms for the base 10. From these we can find the logarithms with any other base, for instance the base 2. We look for the logarithm of a number n for base 2, which will be q, while the logarithm with base 10 of the same number n will be p. Since for base 10, log 2 = 0.3010300 and for base 2, log 2 = 1, then p/q = 0.3010300/1 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277. If every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2.\n91\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: The students should be familiar with the properties of logarithms and exponents and have at least an intuitive understanding of sequences.) Objective: In this activity, the students will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. Materials/Resources: Student Pages for each student; calculator (optional) Time Frame: This entire activity will probably take the equivalent of three class periods, with part of the activity sheet assigned as homework. Part 4 is the most difficult part and may be omitted if necessary. How to Use: An important thing to keep in mind as you work through this is that John Napier, the inventor of logarithms, was looking for a tool that would simplify complex mathematical calculations which were done laboriously by hand. In this project, you will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. This is an easy-to-follow activity that provides an excellent development of the meaning of logarithms. The teacher may need to do some of the exercises as guided practice to provide a direction for student answers.

S2: 2 4 8 16 32 S2: 21 22 23 24 25 64 128 26 27 256 28 512 29 1024 210 2048 211 4096 212 8192 213\nThe sequence S1 gives the power of 2 for the number in S2. 2. (8)(32) = 256 (512)(16) = 2924 = 213 = 8192 (128)( 4) = 2722 = 29 = 512\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe product is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the product of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 3. 8 in S2 corresponds to 3 in S1; 32 in S2 corresponds to 5 in S1; the product 256 corresponds to 8 = 3 + 5 in S1. In the second example, 512 corresponds to 9, 16 corresponds to 4, and the product, 8192, corresponds to 13 = 9 + 4. In the third example, 128 corresponds to 7, 4 corresponds to 2, and the product, 512, corresponds to 7 + 2 = 9. When multiplying the elements of S2, the product will always be an element of S2. This is because 2n2m = 2n+m. In words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. 32/8 = 25/23 = 25-3 = 22 = 8 512/16 = 29/24 = 29-4 = 25= 32 128/4 = 27/22 = 27-2 = 25= 32\n4. 5.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe quotient is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the quotient of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 6. Any two terms in S2 can be divided by considering the exponents, that is, the corresponding numbers in S1, subtracting these numbers, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. 322= (25)2 = 210 = 1026 84 = (23)4 = 212 = 4096 163 = (24)3 = 212 = 4096\n7.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe power of a term in S2 is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the power of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2.\n93\n8.\nAny term in S2 can be raised to a power by finding its exponent, that is, the corresponding number in S1, multiplying this number by the power, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. The easiest way would be to rewrite the number or numbers in S2 as powers of 2 and use the rules of exponents to evaluate the answer. When multiplying the numbers, add the exponents; when dividing the numbers, subtract the exponents; when raising to a power, multiply the exponent by the power.\n9.\nPart 2 Extending the Results 10. Yes the results from part 1 hold here also. The rules of exponents hold no matter what the base is. Let u = bn and v = bm in each of the following: L(u) + L(v) = L(bn) + L(bm) =n+m = L(bn+m ) = L(bn bm ) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(bn)/L(bm) = n/m = L(bn/m ) = L(bn /bm ) = L(u/v) L(uk) = L((bn)k) = L(bnk) = nk definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u rules of exponents definition of the function l\n11.\n94\n= k L(bn ) = k L(u)\ndefinition of the function l definition of u\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier 12. If we read sequence S3 from right to left, each number is 1 smaller than the one to its right. Thus we can extend it to the left by putting 0 to the left of 1 and then the negative integers to the left of 0. If we read sequence S4 from right to left, we see that each number comes from the one to its right by dividing by b. Since the number in S4 under 1 is b, the number to be put under 0 must be b/b = 1. Similarly, the number to be put under -1 must be 1/b. The number under -2 is then (1/b)/b = 1/b2, and so on. Yes the results from number 10 still hold. The rules of exponents hold for all integers. There are many examples that would be appropriate. We write 1/b as b-1; then 1/b2 = b-2. In general, we have 1/bn = b-n, because 1/bn in S4 is under -n in S3. The 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 can be written as 1 = b0. So a 0 exponent always means 1, while a negative exponent means 1 over the corresponding positive power of the base b. log 31 = __0_ log381 = __4_ log33 = _1__ log31/3 = _-1__ log39 = __2_ log3 1/243 = __-5_ log327 = _3__ log31/2187 = _-7\n13. 14.\n15.\nPart 4: Filling up the sequences 16. 1.0000001 1.0000002 1.0000003 1.0000004 1.0000005\nRaising 1.0000001 to a small power seems just to be 1 with 6 decimal places after the 0 and then the small power, although with more decimal places, we would find more distinctions between the numbers. In any case, these numbers are very close together, differing by only .0000001. To get to 3, however, we would need to find n such that (1.0000001)n = 3. The calculator shows that n needs to be something near 11,000,000. It is therefore not very feasible to continue the sequence in this way. 17. We must have tt = 2 because the 1 (from + ) in S1 corresponds to 2 in S2. The solution to the equation t2 = 2 is t = 2. The calculator shows that this is equal approximately to 1.414. And since we use exponents of 2 to designate numbers in S2, we also have t = 21/2. That is, 21/2 = 2. Then log2 t = log2 2 = . Since u3 = 2, we have u = 3 2 = 1.260 = 21/3. Since v3 = 4, because 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 2 and 2 in S1 corresponds to 4 in S2, we get v = 3 4 = 1.587 = 22/3. We could also find v by\n18.\n95\nnoting that v = u2, because 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. It follows that v = ( 3 2 )2. So there are two different ways of expressing v in radical form. Also, log2 u = 1/3 and log2 v = 2/3. 19. The number corresponding to is 4 2 = 1.189 = 21/4. The number corresponding to is 4 8 = ( 4 2 )3 = 1.682 = 23/4. The number corresponding to 3/2 is 8 = (2)3 = 2.828 = 23/2. The number corresponding to 4/3 is 3 16 = ( 3 2 )4 = 2.520 = 24/3 and the number corresponding to 5/4 is 4 32 = ( 4 2 )5 = 2.378 = 25/4. The logarithms to the base 2 of these numbers are, in each case, the fraction that we began with. The number in S2 which corresponds to the fraction m/n in S1 is 2m/n. Since the nth power of this number is 2m, corresponding to the fact that the product of m/n by n is m, we can write this number as n 2 . Also, since m/n is m times 1/n, we know that 2m/n is 21/n raised to the power m. Since 21/n is equal to n 2 , we can also write 2m/n as ( n 2 )m. The calculator shows that 2317/200 = 3 (to three decimal places) and also that 2306/109 = 7 (also to three decimal places). The sum of 317/200 and 306/109 is 95753/21800 and 2 raised to that power is equal to 21, again to three decimal places. Thus 95753/21800 in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. Answers may vary.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n96\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Student Pages\nPart I: Relationships Consider the two following sequences: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\n1. Rewrite the numbers in sequence S2 as powers of a single number. How are the sequences related? 2. Note that when two terms of S2 are multiplied, such as 64 and 128, their product, (64)(128) = 8192, is another term of S2. Pick a few pairs of your own to multiply. Is the product always another term of S2? You may have to extend the terms in each sequence to verify your observations. 3. Note that the number in S1 corresponding to 64 is 6, while the number in S1 corresponding to 128 is 7. The number corresponding to their product, 8192, is 13, the sum of 6 and 7. In other words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. Check that this holds for the other pairs you picked in exercise 2. 4. In a brief paragraph, summarize what you have observed. Most importantly, give a justification for your results using rules of exponents. We will now see if similar laws hold for other mathematical operations. In particular, we will examine the operations of division and taking powers. 5. Take any two terms in S2 and divide the smaller one into the larger. Do at least three cases. In each case, check the corresponding numbers in S1 of your two terms as well as their quotient. 6. After trying several pairs of terms in S2, describe how you could divide any two terms in S2 without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand. 7. Take any term in S2 and raise it to a positive integer power. Do at least three cases. Again, observe the corresponding numbers in S1 of the terms you choose and calculate. 8. After trying several cases, describe how you could raise any term in S2 to a positive integral power without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand.\n97\n9. From the previous problems, we have seen how to multiply, divide and raise to powers by relating terms in S1 and S2 in appropriate ways. Assume that you had no calculator or computer device at your disposal. How would these relationships help you to make complex computations? Explain! Part 2 Extending the Results At this point, we should try to generalize our findings and describe them with some more general mathematical symbols or notation. To do this, let's look at the two following sequences where b > 0. S3: S4: 1 b 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 b5 6 b6 7 b7 8 b8 9 ... b9 ... n bn\nWe begin by defining a function, L(x), which has as its domain the elements of S4. The \"value\" of L(x) is its corresponding term in S3. For example L(b6)=6. In general, L(bn)=n for any positive integer n. 10. Review your results from Part 1 of the project. Do you think they hold here? In particular, use the general terms of S3 and S4 to check if the properties hold. Use algebra only to show that they are true. (Do not plug in values for b. That way, you will be showing the general relationships hold.) 11. Verify that your conclusions in number 10 are actually the following in function notation. Let u and v be terms in S4. Use algebra to show the following three properties hold. L(u) + L(v) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(u/v) L(uk) = k L(u)\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier Now extend the Sequence S3 and S4 to the left as follows: S3 ... -5 -4 5 S4 ... 1/b 1/b4 -3 1/b3 -2 1/b2 -1 1/b 0 1 1 b1 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 ... b5 ...\n12. Why is it reasonable to extend S4 to the left in the way we did? In particular, why should the number in S4 under 0 in S3 be 1? And why should the numbers in S4 under the negative values in S3 be 1 divided by powers of b? Your explanation may well be by analogy to the development of the sequences initially.\n98\n13. Do the general results from number 11 still hold? Test them out by trying a few terms in S3 and S4. Show your examples. Move on when you're convinced that the rules hold for the extended sequences. 14. How can you write the quotients at the left side of S4 in exponential notation? How would you write the 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 in exponential notation? Give a brief definition of what a negative exponent means and what a 0 exponent means. At this point, recall our original sequences, S1 and S2: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\nJohn Napier, the Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms, called the terms of the sequence S1 the \"logarithm\" of the corresponding terms of the sequence S2. The word \"logarithm\" is a translation of the Greek word logarithmos which comes from the Greek words meaning ratio and number; it therefore means \"the number that counts the ratios.\" For example, he called 7 the logarithm of 128. This example shows how many ratios are required for the term 128 to be found. (Note that Napier did not use base b = 2 as in S2, but the ideas are the same.) The function developed in number 11 above is a logarithmic function for base b = 2. We now replace our L notation relating numbers in S1 to those in S2 by the new notation \"log2\" (read as logarithm to the base 2). Thus we have the following results: log21 = 0, log22 = 1, log24 = 2 , log28 = 3, etc.\n15. Use this \"log\" notation above to associate the corresponding terms of the following two sequences: S5 S6 0 1 1 3 2 9 3 27 4 81 5 243 6 729 7 2187\nFind the following... log 31 = ___ log381 = ___ In general, log33 = ___ log31/3 = ___ log39 = ___ log3 1/243 = ___ log327 = ___ log31/2187 = ___\nlogba = c if and only if bc = a.\nThis is the classic modern definition of a logarithm.\n99\nAt this point it is very important to remember that Napier did not use this kind of notation! What we are doing here is trying to see the link between our modern logarithms and the theoretical ideas behind Napier's logarithms. Again, Napier started with two related sequences and then went in a very different direction than we do. Part 4 Filling up the sequences Recall that Napier's original motivation for developing logarithms was to replace multiplication and division by addition and subtraction. The use of these sequences enable us to do this on a very limited scale. We can, for example, by the use of sequences S1 and S2 replace the multiplication 16 times 32 by the addition 4 plus 5. And we can replace the division of 256 by 64 by the subtraction of 6 from 8. But what happens if we want to multiply 3 by 7? Neither of these numbers is in S2 and will not be even if we extend the row further to the left or right. What can we do about this? What we need is to have more numbers in S2. One way to accomplish this and this is essentially Napier's idea is to use a base much closer to 1 than our base of 2. Napier, in fact, used 1.0000001. So the first few terms of his sequences, which we will label S7 and S8 looked like the following: S7 S8 1 1.0000001 2 (1.0000001)2 3 (1.0000001)3 4 (1.0000001)4 5 (1.0000001)5\n16. Use your calculator to rewrite the numbers in S8 in decimal form. What do you notice about these numbers? Given that we wanted to multiply 3 by 7, about how many numbers would we need to take in the sequence S8 in order for 3 (or even a number very close to 3) to appear? Is this feasible? Napier used some very clever ideas to shorten what looks like an impossible task. Yet he nevertheless worked over twenty years on his table. We will look a somewhat different method for putting more numbers in S2. We will first fill in S1 and then try to figure out the appropriate correspondences. We begin by putting in between the 0 and the 1. We now must determine what the corresponding number in S2 must be. We will call it t. S1 S2 0 1 1 t 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64\n17. To determine t, we need to use the properties of these sequences. In particular, we know that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2. Therefore, since + = 1 in S1, we must have tt = 2. (Why?) We can rewrite this equation as t2 = 2. What is t? Write the answer in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. In terms of the log2 notation, what is log2 t? 18. Now put 1/3 and 2/3 in their appropriate positions in S1. Let u be the number in S2 corresponding to 1/3 and v be the number corresponding to 2/3. Again using the property\n100\nthat addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, write an equation which u must satisfy. Solve the equation to determine u in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Then determine v similarly. (Note that instead of using the property that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, you may wish to use the property that multiplication in S1 corresponds to taking powers in S2.) What are log2 u and log2 v? 19. Now put and in their appropriate positions in S1. As in question 18, determine the corresponding numbers in S2 in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Do the same for the numbers 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 in S1. Determine the logarithm to the base 2 of each of the numbers you have now found in S2. 20. By analogy to your solutions to problems 17, 18, and 19, determine in exponential form and in radical form the number in S2 corresponding to the fraction m/n in S1. Use explicitly one or more of the properties relating S1 to S2. Since we have now filled in S1 with as many fractions as we like, we have also filled in S2 with lots of numbers. If we want to multiply 3 by 7, we now need to determine the numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 in S2. 21. The numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 are log2 3 and log2 7, respectively. Show that log2 3 is approximately equal to 317/200 and that log2 7 is approximately 306/109. You will need to use your calculator and the general definition of a logarithm. Find the sum of 317/200 and 306/109. Show that this number in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. 22. Find two other numbers to multiply by the method of exercise 21. You may have to experiment a bit with your calculator to do this. 23. Consult at least two reliable sources (other than the Internet) in the library and write a short biography of John Napier. Your account should include information not contained in this document. Also, find at least one major application of logarithms (not discussed in class) and briefly describe it. Your write up must be typed and be no more than two pages doublespaced. See me if you need resources to consult.\n101\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Properties of exponents; Properties of logarithms; Definition of logarithm) Objective: The purpose of this activity is to give the students an opportunity to investigate, on a introductory level, one way that logarithms can be calculated. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator (optional) Time Frame: One class period with homework assigned to finish the student activity. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss briefly the included Historical Background with the class. The teacher may also want to review the definitions and properties of logarithms and exponents. It would be a beneficial for the teacher to work the activity before presenting it to the class especially to think about different ways to get the solutions, since some of the methods of solution are not unique. Additionally, the order in which to calculate the logarithms is not necessarily the numerical order, so the teacher will want to warn the students of this fact and perhaps give some hints about what to do when. Also note that these are base 10 logarithms that are being calculated. Bibliography Katz, Victor J., A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, Addison Wesley, 1998.\n102\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Solutions\nPart I: log 1 log 1 = y 10y = 1 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 1 y = 0. Therefore log 1 = 0 (this is true for logarithms of any base) At this point it might be best to find log 10 next since it is also easy to calculate: log 10 = y 10y = 10 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 10 y = 1. Therefore log 10 = 1 log 2 Consider the following relationship: 210 = 1024 1000 = 103 210 103 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 210 log 103 Now use the power property of logarithms: 10 log 2 3 log 10 And solve for log 2: log 2 (3 log 10)/10 = (3 1) / 10 = 0.3 So log 2 0.30 log 3 Consider the following relationship: 37 2187 2 1093 2 103 37 2 103\nTake the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 37 log (2 103) Now use the sum property of logarithms: log 37 log 2 + log 103\n103\nNow use the power property of logarithms: 7log 3 log 2 + 3log 10 Solve for log 3: log 3 (log 2 + 3 log 10)/7 (0.30 + 31)/7 = 3.3/7 = 0.47 So log 3 0.47 log 4 Since 4 = 22, So log 4 0.6 log 5 Since 5 = 10/2, log 5 = log (10/2) = log 10 log 2 (by the difference property of logarithms.) 1 0.30 = 0.70 So log 5 0.70 log 6 Since 6 = 23 , log 6 = log (23) = log 2 + log 3 (by the sum property of logarithms.) 0.3 + 0.47 = 0.77 So log 6 0.77 log 7 Consider the following relationship: 72 = 49 50 = 102/2 72 102/2 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 72 log 102/2 Now use the difference property of logarithms: log 72 log 102 log 2 Now use the power property of logarithms: 2 log 7 2 log 10 log 2 Solve for log 7: log 7 (2 log 10 log 2)/ 2 (21 0.30 )/2 = 1.70/2 = 0.85 So log 7 0.85 log 4 = log 22 = 2 log 2 2(0.3) = 0.6\n104\nlog 8 Since 8 = 23, So log 8 0.90 log 9 Since 9 = 32, So log 9 0.94 log 10 log 10 = 1 (see above) Solutions for Part 2: 1. 2. Since log 1 and log 10 are exact values, an equal sign is used and since the other values are approximations, the approximately equal sign is used. Since the other numbers, such as 4, 6 and 8 are products of these prime numbers, we are able to use the approximate values for the logarithms of 2, 3 and 7. Another reason would be that there is no easy way to use the definition of logarithm to find, say log 2 since by the definition, log 2 = y 10y = 2. (Suggestion for additional activity using a graphing calculator, find the intersection of the graphs of y1 = 10x and y2 = 2, to find a value for log 2.) The values are not the same because of the approximations used in the calculations in the project. The values are not exact since approximations were used for log 2, log 3 and log 7. As an example, log 6 was found using both of the approximations for log 3 and log 2. Using a calculator, log 6 = 0.7781513, while the approximation is 0.77. The difference in values is more than 0.008. Using the calculator, log 3 = 0.4771213 and log 2 = 0.30103 while the approximations were log 3 0.47 and log 2 0.30. Both of these approximations were closer to the calculator values than that of log 6. There are many examples of other relationships such as 72 = 49 = 5 10 and so on. 5. The estimate for log 2 is too large because 210 is larger than 103 log 9 = log 32 = 2 log 3 2(0.47) = 0.94 log 8 = log 23 = 3 log 2 3(0.30) = 0.90\n3. 4.\n105\nThe estimate for log 5 is too small because the approximation for log 2 is too large and this value is subtracted from an exact value resulting in an approximation that is too small. 6. There are many approaches. One possible solution is that 112 = 121 120 = 456 Taking the log of both sides gives : 2 log 11 = log 456 = log 4 + log 5 + log 6 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.77 = 2.07 So log 11 2.07/2 log 11 1.035 (the calculator value is 1.0413927)\n106\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Student Pages\nHistorical Background Briggs and Napier each spent many years in doing lengthy computations to determine logarithms. Since Napier did not use base 10 for his logarithms, but Briggs did, this project will demonstrate Briggs' approach. Keep in mind though, that we will be finding approximations for only a few common logarithms and will not have nearly the accuracy that Briggs found when he was developing his logarithm tables. Recall the definitions and properties that you know for logarithms: Definition: logb x = y by = x Sum Property of logarithms: logb(xy) = logb x + logb y Difference Property of logarithms: logb(x/y) = logb x - logb y Power Property of logarithms: logb xn = n logb x Part 1: Find approximations for the common logarithms for the positive integers 1 through 10. Recall that common logarithms are base 10 logarithms. To help get started, there are several hints of approaches to use for finding the logarithms of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 7. log 1 = _________ log 2 __________ log 2\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem (Part 2)Let f (x) be continuous and nonnegative on [a, b] and let A(x) be the area under the graph of y = f (x) over the interval [a, x].

{"text": "Frustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word \"Math\"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.\n\nBecause most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nComplete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.\n\nAvoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.\n\nWrite all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.\n\nSpaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.\n\nFind out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!\n\n• Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:\n\nDo your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nGet in the habit of carrying the calculator with you.\n\nThis is a good habit to get into with your math homework.\n\nUsing the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot.", "function_call_score": 35.79952267303103, "segments_extracted": 13, "original_length": 3771, "filtered_length": 3171, "compression_ratio": 0.8408910103420844}

{"text": "McKellar takes a lightweight approach to math, but is deadly serious about it. In the prologue, she writes that \"lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college.\" Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.\n\nAnd it's not just fear. Girls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school. Testimonials in Kiss My Math fight this.

Each chapter covers a single topic, such as the distributive property or exponents. She clearly explains each topic, and includes problems for the reader to solve (answers are in the back). The author is generous with helpful notes and shortcuts.\n\nA lively, breezy writing style makes it seem as if McKellar is sitting next to the reader.

I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both).

I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!\n\nDanica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school.\n\nGirls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school.\n\nI went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra.", "function_call_score": 16.6621875839828, "segments_extracted": 12, "original_length": 7442, "filtered_length": 6245, "compression_ratio": 0.8391561408223596}

They will explain their mathematical reasoning through a\nvariety of methods, such as words, numbers, symbols, charts, graphs, tables,\ndiagrams, and concrete models. They will use appropriate mathematical notation\nwith clear and accurate language. They will explain how to derive a result based\non previously developed ideas and explain how a result is related to other\nideas.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nfunctions with domain the rational numbers.\n\nNote:\nAlthough some attention will be given to how to teach mathematics effectively to\nchildren, this is a content course, not a methods course. Methodology is the\nprimary focus of the Credential Program.\n\nClass Meetings: MW: 10:50-12:30 pm,\nScience III 103.\n\nTextbook\n(required): Custom\nedition of A Problem Solving Approach to Mathematics for Elementary Teachers,\n10th ed, Part 1, by Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott, and a packet of labs\ntaken from Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers An Activity Approach,\nby Bennett, Burton, and Nelson. Sections of the text being covered in\nlecture should be read prior to coming to class. Lectures will not cover all\ntopics from each section, but students will be responsible for all topics in the\nsection.\n\nSupplies:\nIn addition to the textbook, each student must have a scientific calculator,\nseveral colored pencils, and 1/4-inch graph paper. These should be brought to\nclass with you each day.\n\nHomework:\nMathematics is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Although homework\nassignments will not be collected, it is assumed that you will do the homework\nnecessary for success in this class. We will spend considerable time at the\nbeginning of each lecture working out homework problems. Answers to most of the\nassigned problems are in the back of the book. If you are not able to solve a\nparticular problem, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates will be\ngrateful.\n\nReadings:\nThe student is responsible for reading at least twice each section of the book\ncovered in class: Before and after the lecture. The student will be told in\nadvance what sections of the book are to read. If you are not able to\nunderstand something in the book, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates\nwill be grateful.\n\nQuizzes:\nThere will be seven\nquizzes, each of them administered most Thursdays at 10:35 pm; the student will\nbe able to drop the lowest score. Quizzes may not be made-up. If you miss a\nquiz you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any quizearly with the instructor's permission. Problems will be similar to those in\nthe homework or in the preceding activity. The primary purpose of these quizzesis to provide you with frequent evaluation of your content acquisition and\nto help you to reduce math anxiety. Quiz work is individual, see Note 2\nbelow.\n\nActivities:\nSeven activity\nassignments will be collected; the student will be able to drop the lowest\nscore. Activity attendance is required: Most Thursdays 10:50-12:30.\nThe student should work in groups of at least 3 people and 4 at most. During\nactivity sessions the student will work on an activity sheet and each member\nof his/her group should hand in a report at the beginning of next Thursday at\nthe latest. Activity work must be turned in on the activity pages from the\npacket. Late reports and reports from students absent from even one meeting\nwill not be accepted. A report should be neat and readable; solutions should\nfollow an increasing numerical sequence. Each member of a group will receive the\nsame number of points, so it is your responsibility to write down in each report\nonly the names of those who substantially contributed to the activity.\n\nExams:\nThere will be two Midterm exams and a cumulative final. Questions and problems\nwill deal with concepts discussed in lectures, homework, textbook, and\nactivities. Exchange of information, calculators, and supplies is absolutely\nprohibited during exams! To clarify a particular situation, the instructor\nreserves the right to a further examination, written or oral. Exam work is\nindividual, see Note 2 below. Midterm exams may not be made-up. If you miss\nan exam you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any exam\nearly with the instructor's permission.\n\nGrades:\nYour final grade is a function of the total of points awarded on the activities\nindicated above. Group homework is very helpful and greatly promoted in this\ncourse. However, it is necessary for college graduates to demonstrate individual\ncompetency on the subject. Therefore, regardless of your total of points, in\norder to get a D- or better in this course all of the following should be\nfulfilled at least:\n\nIf\nyou entered the liberal studies program on Fall 2011, you are required to get a\nC or better in all classes that you are taking for your major - this includes\nMath 320.\n\n1)\nIt is the student's responsibility\nto find out what (s)he missed if (s)he did not attend class. Office hours are\nnot meant for tutorial courses, but rather to clarify particular situations or\nproblems occurring during lectures, homework, labs, assignments or readings.\nStudents are encouraged to make use of the Office Hours.\n\n5)\nBeepers, cell phones, i-pods,\nlaptops and similar electronic devices must be turned off at all times during\nclass or lab time. If not, the student will have to leave the room without being\nallowed to return.\n\nIf you miss a\nquiz you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded.\n\nIf you miss\nan exam you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded.\n\nTherefore, regardless of your total of points, in\norder to get a D- or better in this course all of the following should be\nfulfilled at least:\n\n(a) To have scored at least\n200 points in the 2 Midterm exams combined.\n\nGenerally, the following guidelines\nfor grades apply:\n\n960 -1000 A\n900 - 959 A-\n\n870 - 899\nB+ 840 - 869 B 800 - 839 B-\n\n770 - 799\nC+ 740 - 769 C 700 - 739 C-\n\n670 - 699\nD+ 640 - 669 D 600 - 639 D-\n\n0- 599 F\n\nIf\nyou entered the liberal studies program on Fall 2011, you are required to get a\nC or better in all classes that you are taking for your major - this includes\nMath 320.", "function_call_score": 20.56711695265912, "segments_extracted": 19, "original_length": 8217, "filtered_length": 6537, "compression_ratio": 0.7955458196422052}

By working with professors from science, engineering, mathematics\nand computer science departments, the project aims to foster the creation of\ninterdisciplinary courses that demonstrate the interdependence of mathematics\nand science. For example, at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy , first semester students study the concept of change\nfrom both a discrete and a continuous point of view. At the end of the\nsemester students must model and solve particular problems by using a\ndiscrete dynamical system and by using a differential equation. Students then\ncompare and discuss the appropriateness and the results of the two\napproaches. Within the four-course core program, students at the United\nStates Military Academy also examine mathematical topics from the\nperspectives of linear versus nonlinear and stochastic versus deterministic.\nAt Carroll College, a 4-class core consisting of a total of 18 credit hours\ncovers many of the topics seen in the first two years of a traditional\ncurriculum, including differential and integral calculus, multivariable\ncalculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The core also includes\ntopics not usually seen early, if at all: discrete dynamical systems, partial\ndifferential equations, probability, and statistics. Concepts\nare threaded together in and between classes to help students develop a\ndeeper understanding of how different branches of mathematics are\nintertwined. The website contains complete texts for over 40 modeling\nproblems developed at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy site.\n\nAlthough a number of the textbooks produced during the calculus reform\nmovement are no longer in print, both mainstream and reform texts now\nconsider the concepts of calculus from a variety of perspectives: not only\nthe symbolic, but also the graphical, numerical, and verbal.

Many\ncalculus texts now come with software to enhance student understanding from a\nvariety of perspectives.\n\nA good source of ideas on how to teach linear algebra from various\nperspectives is Resources\nfor Teaching Linear Algebra, edited by David Carlson, Charles R.\nJohnson, David Lay, Duane Porter, Ann Watkins, and William Watkins, MAA\nNotes vol. 42.\n\nThe concept of function can be regarded from many different perspectives\nand is important in all undergraduate mathematics courses. The editors of The\nConcept of Function: Aspects of Epistemology and Pedagogy (Harel & Dubinsky, 1992) contributed to the body of\nresearch on learning the function concept in order to assist in instructional\napproaches. Key\nAspects of Knowing and Learning the Concept of Function by Marilyn\nCarlson and Michael Oehrtman is a recent online\narticle that provides a broad view of the subject.\n\nThe MAA'sJournal\nof Online Mathematics and its Applications (JOMA) contains\npeer-reviewed articles, class-tested, web-based learning materials, and\nself-contained, dynamic, single-purpose learning tools. Many of these\nillustrate a range of examples and applications and connections between\nmathematics and other subjects. Some recent articles are Special\nRelativity and Conic Sections, Designing Attribute Acceptance Sampling Plans,\nand Art and Design in Mathematics.\n\nThe MAA'sDigital Classroom Resources\nprovides a select collection of learning materials that are available without\ncharge through the site. These materials have been classroom tested and peer\nreviewed. Many items in the library include editorial reviews and links to a\nmoderated discussion group focused on the materials.\n\nThe MAA's online journal Convergence\nis a new online magazine that provides resources to help teach mathematics\nusing its history. ReinhardLaubenbacher,\nDavid Pengelley, Jerry Lodder,\nand others at New MexicoStateUniversity\nhave developed a large collection\nof instructional materials to teach mathematics using original historical\nsources. Other books that link mathematical topics with their history\ninclude William Dunham's Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of\nMathematics and The Calculus Gallery, Simon Singh's Fermat's\nEnigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem\nand The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum\nCryptography, Rudy Rucker'sInfinity\nand the Mind: The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite, and Marcia Ascher'sEthnomathematics.\nA Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas.

For\ninstance, The\nHeart of Mathematics: An invitation to effective thinking by Edward\nB. Burger and Michael Starbird discusses the\nmathematics of bar codes, cryptography, geometry and art, fractals and chaos,\nand the likelihood of coincidences. A syllabus\nfor an interesting course that makes some use of this text is from Sarah\nGreenwald, Appalachian State University. Another text, Using\nand Understanding Mathematics by Jeffrey O. Bennett and William L.\nBriggs, University of Colorado at Boulder, contains sections on financial\nmanagement, modeling a variety of real-world situations, mathematics and art,\nmathematics and music, mathematics and politics, and mathematics and\nbusiness. See also the listings in this section under \"Introduce Contemporary\nTopics.\"\n\nRobert Devaney, BostonUniversity, is a leader\nin promoting instruction in the contemporary topic of dynamical systems. In\naddition to his books and articles, talks, and professional development\ninstitutes, he has been director of the National Science Foundation's Dynamical Systems and Technology\nProject since 1989. The goal of this project is to show students and\nteachers how ideas from modern mathematics such as chaos, fractals, and\ndynamics, together with modern technology, can be used effectively in the\nhigh school and college curriculum.\n\nThe University of Maryland University College offers Mathematics\n– Contemporary Topics and Applications as both an in-class and\ndistance-learning first-year course. The course is a survey of contemporary\ntopics in mathematics, centering on applications and projects. Topics include\nmeasurements, rates of growth, basic statistics, the mathematics of political\npower, the geometry of the solar system, and computer arithmetic. The goals\nstate that after completing this course a student should be able to cite\nelements of good statistical design, undertake elementary statistical\nanalysis, and recognize and explain the shortcomings of unsound methods of\nstatistical analysis; mathematically analyze situations involving the\nweighting of power in various voting structures and implement apportionment\nof power strategies; and use the Pythagorean theorem and properties of\nsimilar triangles to calculate sizes of and distance between objects,\nincluding astronomical objects.\n\nBoth of the popular texts For\nAll Practical Purposes, produced by the Consortium for Mathematics\nand Its Applications, and Excursions\nin Modern Mathematics by Peter Tannenbaum\nand Robert Arnold aim to convey insight about topics in contemporary\nmathematics and its applications to undergraduate students who have limited\nmathematical backgrounds. Topics in these books include the mathematics of\nvoting, fair division, and apportionment, applications of graph theory to\nmanagement science, fractal geometry, and statistics.\n\nAt Mount Holyoke College George Cobb teaches a course on the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method (MCMC), \"a very general and powerful method for\ncomputer simulation of situations that are too complicated to handle using\nmore conventional mathematical methods. MCMC has become a very active area of\nresearch at the interface of computer science and statistics, and has had a\npowerful impact on the practice of data analysis. As a method for computer\nsimulation, MCMC has very broad applicability. As a branch of mathematics,\nMCMC offers a number of compelling surprises – structures that on a concrete\nlevel seem quite different, but, viewed at the right level of abstraction, turn out to be different versions of the same\nidea.\"\n\nG.H. Hardy once proudly asserted that number theory\nwould never be applied. Yet today number theory has a range of important\napplications. Among these are cryptography (see, for example, lecture notes\nfrom two cryptography\ncourses by Ed Schaefer at Santa Clara University, the RSA website,\nand recent textbooks in number theory and discrete mathematics), and error\ndetection using check digits and error-correcting codes (see, for example, Numbers\nand symmetry: An Introduction to Algebraby\nBernard L. Johnston and Fred Richman and Contemporary\nAbstract Algebra by Joseph Gallian).\n\nEnhance Perception of Vitality and\nImportance of Mathematics\n\nThe World Wide Web provides a wealth of examples of the use and\napplicability of mathematics, but searching for appropriate illustrations can\nbe time consuming. There are several sites that focus on providing good\nexamples for instructors: Plus,\nan Internet magazine that aims to introduce readers to the beauty and the\npractical applications of mathematics; Mathematical Moments,\nan AMS program that offers a series of pdf files\nand podcasts to promote appreciation and\nunderstanding of the role mathematics plays in science, nature, technology,\nand human culture; and the Math Forum,\na center that provides resources, materials, activities, person-to-person\ninteractions, and educational products and services to enrich and support the\nteaching and learning of mathematics.\n\nChance\nNews is a monthly, on-line newsletter that provides abstracts of\narticles from current newspapers, the media, and journals, and suggests\ndiscussion questions for class use.

Facing down a 432-page book devoted to algebra could give even math whizzes pause, but McKellar makes it work, taking the textbook-meets-Seventeen approach by mixing the explanations and equations with boy talk, quizzes, and testimonials from successful women. While a tutor might use this title as a teaching aid, teen girls will want to explore it on their own. Navigation is easy; students are encouraged to hop from chapter to chapter as their homework demands. The breakdown of equations is effective and certainly unconventional—explaining functions in terms of sausage factories, for example, or exponents in terms of whip-bearing female executives (makes sense in the book, promise)—and while McKellar keeps her focus on how to solve math problems, her approach is both readable and even entertaining. --Courtney Jones\n\nBest known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from UCLA, went on to co-write a published math theorem, and continues to be an outspoken role model for young women to excel in math.\n\nMcKellar's 3rd and latest math book encourages teenage girls to outclass the boys in algebra.

{"text": "So I was having a lot of medical issues my freshman year, and I pulled a C+ in second quarter calculus and a C- in third quarter calculus (integration and multivariable calculus, respectively.) I still have one more quarter of calculus entitled \"Vector analysis.\" I'm wondering if my poor performance (and poor understanding of the material) is going to negatively affect me later on. Will I have a chance to relearn some of the material in my other classes, or should I self study to get myself up to par? Just so you know, as of right now I'm leaning towards a Mechanical Engineering major, but I may switch into Civil (though highly unlikely.) This upcoming quarter I'm taking Vector Analysis, first quarter Calculus-based Physics, and a MATLAB course (I have absolutely zero programming experience.) Physics and MATLAB both require integral calculus as a prerequisite. I need a B in physics to switch into MechE. Should I be self studying the calculus that I don't quite understand?\n\nTo understand the computational part of engineering you need to understand differential equations, which is where you use the calculus skills. You then use DEs to describe all kinds of physical phenomena. So, the basic calculus skills are very important to understanding engineering.\n\nThanks HPuck. So would it suffice to get down integration and partial derivatives and their applications? Or should I learn other things like Taylor Polynomials and Convergence/Divergence (the stuff that tripped me up most)?\n\nCalculus is one of the few subjects you really need to put in the effort to learn well. Study all of it until you have a strong conceptual understanding of it. Bad grades are bad grades, but calculus is important.\n\nCalculus will be used in physics. Multivariable calculus will become important when you take the physics course with electricity and magnetism. Differential equations will become important in many places.\n\nTry and improve on basic integration/misc techniques (integration by parts, partial fraction decomp, trig int, partial derivations, etc) because these will be very important in DE. A lot of questions will have a lot of nested integrals/nasty integrals and you don't want to get stuck in the middle of the question. Freshen up on Taylor and Maclaurin series. When you take linear alg practice matrix techniques, translation matrices, etc. (will be used in systems of differential equations)There are only two subjects you absolutely have to know, without constantly consulting a reference: calculus and physics.\nYeah, it will come back to haunt you if you don't put in the effort to get the hang of it. Get on that, no matter how much work it takes.1 year left of Engineering school. Taylor series rarely comes into play. The only time it did show up, it was just mentioned as part of the proof and we didn't have to do anything with it. But yes, calculus is EXTREMELY important, if not for the pure concept of what it means to take the integral/derivative. Also, so so many people don't have a good grasp on all the material that came before calculus too, especially trig. Know your trig, it will help you out, a lot.\n\nWill I have a chance to relearn some of the material in my other classes, or should I self study to get myself up to par?

{"text": "We will create a set of 30 self-standing math lessons for self-learners . Each lesson will present a classic math problem and a deep idea which it illustrates. We will organize an online support center for tutoring and consulting, but especially for supporting \"math in action\" for analysis and communication of challenges and solutions in our changing world, focusing on climate change. We will publish a paperback, worksheets, a wiki and YouTube videos, all in the Public Domain.\n\nAndrius Kulikauskas is since childhood a lifelong learner on a quest to know everything and apply that knowledge usefully. At the University of California at San Diego, he studied mathematics as a tool for conceptual thinking. He was appointed senior teaching assistant, responsible for training the first year teaching assistants. He earned his Ph.D. in 1993 for this thesis \"Symmetric Functions of the Eigenvalues of a Matrix\".\n\nAndrius taught a Precalculus class at UCSD for students who were ill prepared for Calculus. He knew the dismal state of mathematics teaching. High school teachers generally don't think mathematically. Truly, mathematics should be a tool for thinking, where the point is first to understand the relevance of various models, and only then to calculate. Unfortunately, textbooks are full of contrived, irrelevant problems which hinder mathematical intuition. Andrius taught from his own notes:  He identified the key ideas leading up to Calculus, and surveyed them all in thirty one-hour lessons. His students did very well!\n\nIn 2008, Andrius taught algebra as a Professor at American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He taught 90 business students, many of whom were unmotivated because they thought math was irrelevant, and yet they rated him an outstanding teacher. He concentrated on teaching them a few dozen classic problems which were difficult but insightful. For example, suppose that the price of a barrel of oil goes up by one-third this week, but then goes down by one-third next week. What is the overall change in price? Many people suppose that the two changes cancel out and the price is the same. But actually, if the barrel of oil costs $90, then it goes up to $120, but down to $80! And, in general, it goes up from X to 4/3 X and then down to 8/9 X. This is a very thoughtful problem and it illustrates a very deep idea, which is that algebra is the study of thinking step-by-step. If you don't think step-by-step, you can't solve this problem, because you won't know what \"one-third\" means. Most books and teachers don't and can't teach step-by-step thinking because it's a lot of work to grade. But if the problem is truly relevant, then the effort is worth it!\n\nImagine if all of math education was organized around such classic problems. Andrius will write an essay for every such problem to show why and how it's interesting for a mathematician and philosopher. Each lesson can include many variants of the problem along with applications and exercises. A few dozen problems are enough to survey all of algebra. They could fit in a paperback of 150 pages or so.\n\nImagine if people could use such materials without restriction! Ours will be in the Public Domain so they might be shared, adapted and improved! A teacher in Africa might print out one lesson at a time, think up a game that teaches the concept, and then write a letter how it went. People could share examples and applications from around the world!\n\nIndeed, we can set up a wiki to collect classic problems, ideas and examples in math and other subjects. A wiki is an online tool with which individual problems could be easily edited and linked together into a pattern language, as in Christopher Alexander's \"A Timeless Way of Building\". Yet each lesson can also stand on its own.\n\nWe have many opportunities to apply math in our world. We can develop math intuition based on real problems, not contrived exercises. We can organize an online community to create learning materials in the Public Domain that encourage self-learners to understand mathematics in terms of its deep ideas and practical applications. As we face global challenges, including our current economic crisis, we find social and business opportunity in recognizing what is truly worth learning, and making that available for all to share freely. We offer a Baltic and Nordic team to start up this activist approach to education.\n\nAndrius will start by identifying noteworthy math problems from his own notes, from websites, from discussion groups, from colleagues online and from mathematics textbooks, especially intuitive books such as \"Applying Arithmetic: A Handbook of Applications of Arithmetic\" by Zalman Usiskin and Max Bell and \"How to Lie with Statistics\" by Darrell Huff. He will continuously look for new problems and invite others to contribute them. He will relate each problem with a deep idea that it illustrates. He will select what he thinks are the thirty or so pairs of problems and ideas which most completely and profoundly present mathematics. He will write an essay for each problem/idea.\n\nAndrius will also create a general format for writing up each problem, idea and related examples, illustrations, applications and exercises. He will adapt the wiki at worknets.org with templates and navigation which accomodate the contributing, polishing and organizing of these problems for self-learners.\n\nEarly in our project, Andrius will travel to Tampere, Finland to work for one month with filmmaker Teemu Takatalo at the Hirvitalo community centre. Andrius will work with activists to understand what math ideas might be relevant for their campaigns. Teemu will coach them on using video to communicate these ideas.\n\nMidway into our project, Andrius will start publishing individual lessons online. Miksike's adult learners will test the lessons and help create related worksheets. Andrius will return to work with them.\n\nAs the videos are completed, they will be published online and also made available through our wiki. Didzis Veinbergs will promote them and the activist's campaigns along with the upcoming book. Andrius Kulikauskas will visit him in Latvia and they will publish and promote a short paperback of \"Classic Math Problems\".\n\nWe will adapt the book and translate it from English into Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian and publish and promote electronic versions.\n\nOur project includes four partners from Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Finland.\n\nAndrius Kulikauskas will select the problems and ideas, author the essays, the lessons and the paperback, and code the wiki and help room. This work is the heart of this project. He will be supported by Minciu Sodas's team of online assistants who will collect interesting examples and tutor self-learners.\n\nPispalan kulttuuriyhdistys ry (Pispala Cultural Association) runs the Hirvitalo center of contemporary art in Tampere, Finland. Hirvitalo is a base for artistic and cultural activists, including gardens and permaculture. Markus Petz is now the European Voluntary Service coordinator there. He first met Andrius on a road trip they took together to visit UK independent thinkers. Markus organized a video bridge from Hirvitalo in 2008 with Andrius about his paper \"An Economy for Giving Everything Away\".\n\nPispala Cultural Association will organize ten activists addressing the consequences of globalization, especially climate change. Each activist will create a YouTube video illustrating \"math in action\" in their campaigns. Teemu Takatalo will coach them in video skills.\n\nŪdenszīmes (Signs of Water) is an NGO from Jēkabpils, Latvia, that is working towards improving the possibilities of education for children and young people in Latvia, thus helping create an educated, ethical and responsible society. It was founded in 2007, and its founding members have been active in other NGOs since 1997. Ūdenszīmes will host Didzis Veinbergs's work to publish our Classic Math Problems as a paperback in the Public Domain. Didzis and Andrius met in 2008 at BarCamp Baltics. Andrius invited Didzis to Vilnius for the workshop \"Ethical Public Domain: Debate of Questionable Practices\" which Minciu Sodas organized for COMMUNIA, the European Union's thematic network for the Public Domain. Didzis spoke there about his plan to publish books with free licences. Didzis will publish, promote and distribute Andrius's book as well as provide designers and/or illustrators for related websites.\n\nEach of the partners will contribute co-financing in terms of the work of their many volunteers who will collect examples and staff our help room and translate into Lithuanian (Minciu Sodas), try out our lessons and create worksheets (Miksike), apply our math lessons to climate change and other global challenges (Pispala Cultural Association) and promote and distribute our book (Ūdenszīmes).\n\nWe will publish a short, readable, popular book \"Classic Math Problems\" with essays on about 30 math problems and the deep ideas they illustrate, along with applications and exercises, and an introduction that weaves them all together. There is a chance that our book will become a classic. \"How to Lie With Statistics\" was first published in 1954 and today ranks in the top 7,000 books at Amazon.com\n\nWe will also include links to 10 videos that show our \"math in action\". We will have helped 10 activists use math to make their case to the public and relevant institutions. We aim for at least one of them to achieve a success that affects or inspires at least 100,000 people.\n\nWe will create worksheets for use through Miksike and other venues. In particular, we will create one-page worksheets, each dedicated to one lesson, so that a teacher can print them out on-demand when they prepare for their class.\n\nAll of the content which we create for this project will be in the Public Domain.\n\nWe will distribute our printed book to at least 500 people around the world who will help promote the printed and/or online versions, bring attention to them and open up business opportunity. We're especially interested in parents, especially homeschoolers, who would like to learn math better so they could teach their children, and also activists who might benefit from applying mathematics and thereby raise public interest in our classic math problems. We expect at least 7,000 people to read or hear lessons from the printed book and that a second printing be profitable.\n\nIn the first year that the book is available, we expect at least 10,000 people in the Nordic and Baltic region to download the electronic book in English, Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian. We expect 100,000 people around the world to download the English version and another 100,000 people to learn from it through the One Laptop Per Child program with which we have links through Edward Cherlin's Earth Treasury, a working group of Minciu Sodas.\n\nHow will you evaluate that your project has met its objectives\n\nWe would like to see one or more of our lessons receive attention in the press thanks to its significance for some activist campaign. We would like one or more of our videos to be popular at YouTube. We will make up for each lesson a \"tag\" (like \"halfrectangle\") which can be used on YouTube, Flickr and other sites to note the uses of our classic math problems that all are encouraged to share. We would be excited to see people using such a tag system.\n\nWe wish to encourage a growing number of people that math's deep ideas and classic problems are truly relevant for thinkers and activists, especially for global issues such as climate change.

This book also includes discussions of important historical textbooks and primary sources to help readers further understand the development of modern mathematics.\n\nVictor J. Katz received his PhD in mathematics from Brandeis University in 1968 and has been Professor of Mathematics at the University of the District of Columbia for many years. He has long been interested in the history of mathematics and, in particular, in its use in teaching. He is the editor of The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India and Islam: A Sourcebook (2007). He has edited or co-edited two recent books dealing with this subject, Learn from the Masters (1994) and Using History to Teach Mathematics (2000). Dr. Katz also co-edited a collection of historical articles taken from MAA journals of the past 90 years, Sherlock Holmes in Babylon and other Tales of Mathematical History. He has directed two NSF-sponsored projects to help college teachers learn the history of mathematics and learn to use it in teaching.

Find the height of the building in meters and then in feet, rounded off to the nearest whole number. The formula for distance fallen is y= L 2 gt\nwhere t= time in seconds, and g=gravitational acceleration (9.80665 meters per second-squared). We measure the y coordinate from the position where the brick began its fall, and we specify that y is positive upwards.\n\nThe TI-36X performs numerical integration using Simpsons Rule. To prepare for an integral, store the lower limit in memory variable A, the upper limit in memory B, and the number of intervals (from 1 to 99) in memory C. Press 0 and enter the expression, using memory variable A as the independent variable. Then press V. While the calculator is processing the data, CALC displays. When the calculation is successfully completed, the TI-36X will return the numerical value to the result line. In addition, the calculator will clear memory variable C; A and B will be equal to the upper limit. If A>B, or if C is not an integer 1-99, or if A, B, or C is undefined, Integrate Error will display, and A, B, and C will be cleared. If you want to solve a given problem again using a different number of intervals or different limits, enter values to store in memory variables A, B, and C. Then scroll to the integration problem in history and press V; the calculator will solve the same problem with the new data. The time the calculator takes to solve the problem depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of intervals. You can abort the calculation by pressing and holding T until Integrate Error is displayed. With polynomials up to the third degree, Simpsons rule yields the exact answer, so increasing the number of intervals will not change the results. However, with polynomials of higher degree and equations containing more complicated functions (such as trigonometry), increasing the number of intervals will improve the precision of the results. Note: When you perform integration with trigonometric functions, the calculator must be in radian mode. 30\n\nYou can enter up to 42 points or data pairs. When using the LN regression, you do not need to find the natural logarithms of the numbers. Enter the data directly, and the TI-36X makes the transformation. Similarly, when you want to make a prediction with the LN regression equation, you enter the value of x directly (and not ln x), and the calculator returns the predicted value of y (and not ln y).\nTi36eng1.doc TI-36X II Manual Linda Bower Revised: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Printed: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Page 34 of 48\nTo set up the problem and perform the analysis: 1. Press %f. Select the desired type of analysis from the menu and press V. The STAT indicator displays. 2. Press 7. 3. Enter a value for X1 and press $. 4.

That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to \"demonstrate further\" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. \"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.", "function_call_score": 20.311933260790713, "segments_extracted": 3, "original_length": 2757, "filtered_length": 2333, "compression_ratio": 0.8462096481682989}

Proofs are things that you don't really see in the high school math level. I like \"How to Think Like a Mathematician\" as a much gentler introduction than the more classic \"A Transition to Advanced Mathematics\" (and much less expensive).\n\nThere's another book on the market called \"How to Prove It\" but I've not read it so I can't say how good/bad it is. It seems to have decent reviews.\n\nIn some of MIT's modules there are example sheets & solutions, which is good.\n\nBasically, I would start by going and getting a basic book off amazon on algebra and/or geometry. Maybe a standard book on it, or just a questions and answer book.\n\nBut yeah, work through a million questions, get used to things... don't be afraid to ask stuff on internet forums (like on 2+2) and also it's good to ask people you know if they're good enough and are willing to teach you a thing or two.\n\nI'm not a math guy but this seems a bit narrow. I don't know how you'd get a good general overview, because there are dozens or hundreds of mathematical fields, often with overlap, but I know calculus and ODEs and I wouldn't say I \"know math\" even remotely.\n\nIt seems like abstract algebra is a good starting place since people who do \"know math\" seem to reference it a lot - set theory and number theory maybe? College-level geometry would probably be nice. Mathematical logic? Complex analysis?\n\nI've learned some things in data structures, algorithms, numerical analysis, combinatorics, and computability theory, mostly as a result of reading about computer programming. That stuff is awesome to me but I don't even know how you'd get there from a \"general mathematics\" background. If you want computer math I recommend those topics though, I doubt you can do much with computers unless you have at least data structures, algorithms, and computability theory - but for \"more discrete\" tasks combinatorics is a must, and for \"more continuous\" tasks you really need numerical analysis. Might even want to study some more programming-related stuff too, knowing how floating-point types are implemented would be awfully valuable if you ever want to do math-related code.\n\nI'll use 'How to Think Like a Mathematician' by Kevin Houston and skip 'The Princeton Companion' for now. Proofs seem to be very important and indeed in high-school we focused on computations.\n\nThat's just the high-school algebra I see often mentioned together with trigonometry as a prereq. for a course in calculus.\n\nI've already refreshed some high-school stuff. I think the free ebooks from CK12.org are good? Problems with exercercises or questions I can post on several fora.\n\nThe 4 MIT OCW courses are 'Scholar' math-courses, specifically designed for self-study. I've already gone through some lectures on Calculus I and I think it's all pretty good organised (recitation videos, worked examples, exams (+solutions), ... ).\nI also read when you're a Math Major (General Option) those 4 courses are required while the rest is flexible.\nThis is probably indeed far from a 'decent general background' but I guess I need to start somewhere.\n\nThanks.

{"text": "John Foradori's Math Blog\nTips to survive the mathematics journey!Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000en-UShourly1 algebra classes\n 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000John Foradori have fallen in love with the function-approach to algebra, and if I were teaching algebra 1, or even below that (as the CCSSM allows), everything would be taught from the perspective of a function.\n\nStarting with functions from day one, you can reinforce everything about the functions, domains, ranges, families, etc with each and every lesson (just about!).\n\noperations on expressions? Yep, start with a function that has the expressions you want. You can get so much more out of it. This can lead to so much more understanding. In class right now, students are dealing with rational functions in the form f(x)=a/(x-h) +k, finding the characteristics, then rewriting it as a quotient of two polynomials and comparing the graphs. Good stuff, and can be done with every type of function. I think it gives meaning to algebraic manipulation, why do we do it, what happens when we do it, and how does it really change the original function. These are powerful questions whose answers give real depth and meaning to the algebra classes.\n\nI went through the EMATHS training, but the classes I taught never really let me explore the shifts that strongly (namely statistics and AP Calculus). I had a feeling that the function-based approach was, in my opinion, stronger and more flexible than the other way, but since I never had a chance to really explore it, it wasn't cemented.\n\nIt is now. Everything that can be done in a math class can be done from a function perspective and so much more. I will never go back!\n\nThere have been questions about learning procedures, the rigor of some of the algebraic skills like \"simplifying\" expressions, applying properties, etc. It's all there, all of it. It's just a different way of getting there.\n\nI will leave this with a story. Since we were converting a rational function from one form to another, and to get the students thinking about what is going on, I took a piece of paper and told them this was a function. We can do a lot with a function in this form, and we came up with a lot of uses for it. Then I crumpled up the paper and asked how I changed the paper. Did I add anything? Did I take anything away? Is it still that original piece of paper, just dressed up differently? Then I asked about the uses of my crumpled up piece of paper. Can I do the same things? Can I do different things? I highlighted the different uses of the wad of paper by playfully tossing it around the room. When we discuss this as a group, hopefully we will get to the point that even if a function is in a different form, it really hasn't changed (check the graphs), but the uses for it have.\n\nThese students are solving the equations graphically and then algebraically, which is all I can ask for right now. They are getting more and more comfortable with the tech and with the content, which will lead to next week and more group work on some exploration activities. They are making pretty good progress!\n\n]]> Summer School Adventure! #1\n 30 Jun 2012 13:56:48 +0000John Foradori all (anyone that is taking time from their summer vacation to read this!)\n\n1. Set-up\nSetting up the technology was a bit of an issue. The biggest thing was getting the Ti-Navigator set up and running. I had to upgrade the operating systems first and do a lot of the hardware upgrades. Not a big deal, and not unexpected, but it took a few days to get them started. Finally, on Wednesday, I got the bugs worked out of the navigator, the class set up, and everything working. More on that later!\n\n2. The Teaching\nEven being out of the classroom for only a year made the first couple of days a bigger challenge than I anticipated. My last classroom experience was a class I taught at Macomb CC, which is a little different than teaching in high school. I found myself falling back into that routine a little bit more than the high school routine. It took a couple of days for me, but I hit a groove during the day on Thursday.\n\n3. The Students\nIt took a while to get them into the swing of things as well. Summer school is an interesting experience, and can be a very dry, extremely oppressive atmosphere (in my opinion) for the students. Since it is credit recovery, they are there because of past failures, and their attitudes about math and math classes are very negative. Put them in a room that is high stakes, for five hours a day, and this could lead to a very negative atmosphere. So far, though, the students have been really good and have been participating, especially in the last couple of days. In fact, they are very engaged, and I think I've found the reason for it:\n\nOnce I got this thing up and running, and once I got used to it (it took me a couple of days, and I think the class slowed a bit because of it), things started to roll! For example, yesterday we were dealing with exponential functions. We had a whole class discussion of what exponential growth was (I use The Matrix as an example, when Agent Smith, the bad program, develops the power to copy himself, and we discuss how long it takes him to take over a world with 8 billion people in it). With some guidance on my part, we developed the function f(x)=1*2^x, and what all the parts of the function were. I expanded it to f(x)= initial value * (growth factor)^x. We worked through some examples of finding the parts of the function, the initial value and growth factor. ( f(x)=a*(1+r)^x )\n\nInstead of the typical \"give the students a couple of minutes, let the brave one give the answer and move on,\" way of trying to tell if the students get the answer, I sent out a quick poll. It is amazing that when there is an accountability on the screen showing how many people have or haven't answered, how fast the answers come in.\n\nEvery student had an answer, and we had a discussion about the answers, about every student's answers. There were about 3 misconceptions that came up that we were able to address immediately. Every student saw their answer on the screen, and I was able to give instantaneous feedback, and students got instantaneous feedback.\n\nThis is a form of formative assessment (FA), and I've used it a lot over the last couple of days. It is amazing how effective FA's are at clearing up misconceptions fast and moving the class forward. I was trying to use them before I left the classroom, but I don't think I fully \"got it\" then. I get it now. Granted, I have a great tool to use, the navigator, and not all the math teachers have them. There are other ways to get them going. More on that in the future.\n\nI am rambling, too much coffee. I will discuss more of my views and experiences as we go through the summer.\n\nHighlights:\n—I love the technology!\n—Formative Assessments are a huge key to moving a class forward. (and you don't need the tech to do it, you just need some creativity)\n—Get the students engaged, working, and hold them to it!\n—These students, who hate math, are showing improvement!\n—Give them hope that they can do it, give them tasks that they can succeed on, and build on that success.\n\n]]> Wormeli on Differentiation\n 06 Jan 2012 18:50:10 +0000John Foradori is an excellent source on Differentiated Instruction.

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \"algebra\" broadly, defining it as a \"method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance\". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is \"the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge\" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

{"text": "CalcPlot3D, an Exploration Environment for Multivariable Calculus\n\nUsing CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus\n\nOne way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures. I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments. Before giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board. Once students have seen one example using the applet, most have little trouble completing the exercise on their own.\n\n]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own.", "function_call_score": 44.686443860307925, "segments_extracted": 6, "original_length": 2663, "filtered_length": 2606, "compression_ratio": 0.9785955689072474}

{"text": "The grading scheme from the student guide is reproduced below.\nThere are three components to the student's grade.\nAs the instructor, you are responsible for the determining the\nsection component and how you will\nuse it to adjust the student's final course grade.\n\nEvaluating the section component. Since we consider cooperative\nlearning to be an essential feature of the introductory program, we\nrequire that team homework count for at least 40% of the section component.\nAside from that, it is up to you how to determine the section component\nof the grade. For example, you may choose to give weekly individual or\ngroup quizzes and/or\ndaily reading quizzes; you may choose to collect individual homework;\nyou may choose to give credit for in-class work, presentations, extra\ncredit, good team evaluations, etc. It helps to choose a system\nthat encourages study habits that you believe will contribute to\nstudent learning.\n\nInforming the students.\nIt is important that you explain your system for evaluating the section component clearly\nand carefully in your first day handout\nso that your students know how they will be evaluated.\nIt is also important to ensure that the feedback you give students on their\nsection work accurately reflects the impact it will have on their\ngrade. There are many simple ways to achieve this. One is to\ngrade section work with a median of approximately 70%. If that does\nnot suit your class, or your grading, an alternative is\nto announce the median score each time you return graded work.\n\nThe Grading System: Reproduced from the Student Guide\n\n1. The uniform component.\nThere are two uniform midterm exams and a uniform final exam.\nEach of these exams will be taken by all students\nin all sections at the same time, and are graded by all the instructors\nworking together.\nYour uniform component score will be determined from your scores on each exam as follows:\n\nAfter each exam, a letter grade will be assigned to your uniform component score using\na scale determined\nby the course director specifically for that exam.\nWe do not use the \"10-point scale\" often seen in high school\ncourses in which scores in the 90's get an A,\nin the 80's get a B, and so forth;\nthe level of difficulty of the exams will be considered.\nThe scale for the uniform component score will apply to all students in all sections.\n\n2. The section component. To help you learn the material,\nyou will be given a variety of reading assignments, team homework,\nindividual homework, quizzes and other in-class activities. Your instructor will decide how the section component is determined for your particular section and grade the section work to determine your section score.\nThe section component has the potential to increase your final grade above the baseline grade by one third of a letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to an A-, etc.); and, assuming that the assigned work is completed, this component cannot lower your final grade below the baseline grade by more than one third of a letter grade. So, if you are keeping up with the course and doing well\nin your section work,\nit will not only help you to do well in the uniform exams, but may also\nadd to your baseline grade. Similarly, if you\nfall behind in your section work, it may reduce your baseline grade.\n\n3. The gateway component. There will be one or two (depending\non the course you are taking)\nonline basic skills gateway test(s) which you need to pass by the\ndeadline announced in the course schedule. These routine tests are repeatable,\nand in general do not pose a problem for students who are keeping up with the course work.\nYou may practice each test online\nas many times as you like, and you may take\na test for a score as often as twice per day\nuntil the deadline. The gateway tests do not have the potential to raise your baseline\ngrade, but if they are not passed by the deadline, the gateway component will\nautomatically reduce your final grade in the course. Deadlines and grade penalties\nwill be announced in your class. All sections of your course have the same deadlines\nand penalties assigned to the gateway component.\n\nSection averages.\nCourse policy is that a section's average final letter grade cannot differ\ntoo much from that section's average baseline letter grades.\nThis means that the better your entire section does on the uniform exams,\nthe higher average letter grade your instructor can assign in your section.\nIt is therefore in your best interest to help your fellow students in\nyour section do well in this course.\nIn other words, cooperation counts!\n\nGrades at the university.\nMany students who come to the University of Michigan have to adjust\nthemselves to college grading standards.\nThe mean high school grade point average\n(recalculated using only strictly academic classes)\nof our entering students is around 3.6,\nso many of you were accustomed to getting \"straight A's\"\nin high school.\nStudents' first reaction to college grades is often,\n\"I've never gotten grades like these.\"\nHowever, a grade of 15/20 on a team homework assignment\n(which you might previously have converted to 75% - a high school C)\nmay well be a good score in a college math course.\nYour own instructor is your best source of information on\nyour progress in the class.\n\nDescribing the grading system to students. You should state\nexplicitly how you plan to arrive at semester grades - what exams will be\ngiven, approximately what weight they will have in the overall assessment of\nthe student's work, how team homework is counted, how much quizzes will\ncount, etc. The in-class component of the grade can be based on quiz\nscores, individual homework, class participation, or whatever you find\nappropriate. It is important to not to assign letter grades to the\nin-class component of the grade because the grades you award at the end of\nthe term will have to be in alignment with the performance of your class on\nthe uniform exams.\n\nGrade books and records. Keep a good, clear record of your\ngrades in a secure place. Don't lose it. Record all scores which\nwill count towards students' grades. Many grades complaints can be\nprevented by keeping accurate records. It's easy to forget to record\ngrades before returning papers, so record everything, including all grade\nchanges, immediately. Students are very serious about their grades and\nexpect them to be treated as a strictly private matter. You do not\nneed to keep a record of students' attendance unless you choose to, however,\nyou may want to note any extended absences.\n\nComplaints about your grading. From the point of view of\nUniversity of Michigan students, a great deal hinges on getting the high\ngrades they are accustomed to getting in high school. Many first term\nfreshman have never had a grade lower than an A! They will often\nargue persistently over one or two points. This is not a sign that they\ndon't respect you. Of course, you should treat all student\ncomplaints about grading mistakes or unfairness in a serious manner.\n\nWe do not use the \"10-point scale\" often seen in high school\ncourses in which scores in the 90's get an A,\nin the 80's get a B, and so forth;\nthe level of difficulty of the exams will be considered.", "function_call_score": 19.80707395498392, "segments_extracted": 14, "original_length": 7775, "filtered_length": 7142, "compression_ratio": 0.9185852090032154}

{"text": "Number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., and related objects that arise in their study. It is tempting to assume that something as simple as the counting numbers must be rather well understood. But this is far from the case! Indeed, number theory owes much of its charm to the wealth of easily-stated problems -- possible to explain to middle-school age children -- which have so far defied solution, despite hundreds of years of effort by great mathematicians.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the foundational results, with particular attention paid to some the pathbreaking accomplishments of the 18th and 19th centuries. We will start with the basic theory (factorization into primes) before turning to Gauss's theory of congruences. The theory of congruences culminates with a proof of Gauss's Aureum Theorema (golden theorem), the law of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nMore advanced topics will be discussed later in the course. Possibilities include theorems about sums of squares, results on arithmetic functions, and results on the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nNumber theory, more than some other areas of mathematics, is largely an experimental science. It is recommended (but not required) that you download software that allows you to play with very large numbers.

Late homework will not be accepted. (If you have a need to turn in HW early, that can be arranged.) Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the term.\n\nOn homework, collaboration is allowed and in fact is very much encouraged. Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently.

Its time to turn a new leaf in the chapter of life. New challenges, new faces, new subjects and more tests. So what did you do in the summer to keep motivated, or practice new habits?\n\nProof techniques are fun. They are mathematical arguments of sufficiency. The feeling you get from arguing your point logically to completion is always exhilarating. Let us put our mathematical reasoning power to the test. Now since this is our first of many proof techniques. I will start with something elementary.\n\nWhen doing proofs it is best to do so in algebraic and generalized form. A way to represent all possible cases. Using only examples would be trivial, since we know...\n\nStudents often ask me how do Mathematicians come up with various formulas in Trigonometry, Algebra and Calculus? By method of Proofs and Derivation I would exclaim, which in my opinion is becoming a lost art. I found deriving formulas helped to seal the understanding of the concepts and theories in Math. I believe it is thus fitting as an end to our talk on polynomials, to derive the equation of the quadratic formula. We will do so by using the last method we discussed, \"Completing the Square\".\n\nIt has been a while since my last post, but as promised I am back. Recently a reader of one of my blogs commented on how helpful they were in helping her explain a concept to her HS Junior. I was indeed very glad to hear. It certainly is an encouragement to see parents, not only sign their child up for tutoring but also willing to follow through the covered material as well.

{"text": "How are the MathTutorDVD.com line of DVDs different from others? The answer is simple. Most math instruction involves a lengthy discussion of the abstract theory behind the Math before instructing the student in how to solve problems. While there are some merits to this style, in the vast majority of the cases the student quickly gets bored and frustrated by the time he or she starts to solve the problems. This DVD, in contrast, teaches all of the concepts by working fully narrated problems step-by-step, which is a much more engaging way to learn.\n\nWhat is our teaching style like? All topics on this DVD are taught by working example problems. There are no traditional lectures of background material that won't help you solve problems and improve your skills. We believe in teaching-by-doing and that is what you will receive by watching this DVD. The Equations Of Motion are explained, for example, by working many problems in step-by-step detail. We begin with the easier problems and work our way up to the harder problems. The student immediately gains confidence, does not get bored, and quickly feels like he or she can conquer the material. This method is extremely powerful and has proven itself time and again. Perhaps most importantly, problem solving skills are honed early on that will help with homework and taking exams even after watching the very first lesson.\n\nThe student immediately gains confidence, does not get bored, and quickly feels like he or she can conquer the material.", "function_call_score": 20.606754436176303, "segments_extracted": 3, "original_length": 1747, "filtered_length": 1502, "compression_ratio": 0.8597595878649112}
{"text": "Calculator: Calculators may come in handy during class or in\nyour homework from time to time, but I will not require you to have\none. They will be allowed on tests and homework, though on tests you\nwill find them to be of limited value. If you intend on sharing a\ncalculator with a friend, keep in mind that sharing calculators is not\npermitted on exams.\n\nIdeally, a calculator should be able to do ordinary arithmetic operations,\nas well as some additional functions like exponentiation (powers) and\nsquare roots. It need not be able to graph or be programmed.\n\nNote that cell phones and laptops are not allowed during exams, so if\nyour only calculator is a calculator program on your cell phone or\nlaptop, you will want to get a stand-alone calculator, or you will not\nhave one during the exams. In general, nothing that will permit\nelectronic communication with another student or people outside the\nroom may be used on exams.\n\nWell, what math background are you expected to have? I realize that the\nrange of math classes taken by students in math 102 varies widely, and\nthis includes the extent to which students remember various facts.\nThis course, however, is not in sequence with the standard math sequence,\nand so mastery of past math subjects is not as relevant in this class\nas compared to what you might be used to.\n\nMost of the course is based on concepts rather than specific skills,\nthough some skill will come in handy at some points. Though these\ntimes are relatively rare, the strong reaction some students feel when\nthey do not know the relevant skils may make it loom large in their\nminds. Most of these skills, when they come up, are at the\npre-algebra and algebra level: using variables, understanding\nalgebraic expressions, and sometimes solving simple equations. It is\nassumed that students have had exposure to algebra and geometry at\nsome point, but it is not assumed that they have a strong mastery of\neither subject.\n\nIf you find you need some review on some topic like this that is used\nin class, come by my office hours or use the tutoring service mentioned\nabove.\n\nThe Idea of this class: This is most likely a very different kind\nof math class than you have ever had. Most math classes you have\nexperienced emphasize skills: how to solve a quadratic equation, or\nhow to find an unknown side in a triangle. This class will emphasize\nideas and concepts. ``How to do it'' will take a back seat to\n``Why does it work?''\n\nThis is also a course where we seek to discover math together. I'm\nnot here to tell you the answer; I'm more of a guide to help you\nexplore a mathematical concept. Through this course, I hope to show\nyou the big picture: what mathematics is all about. This is something\nthat many students don't see in high school courses, or even some\ncollege level courses. Once you see math from this point of view, I\nhope you will be able to see why mathematicians feel that mathematics\nis beautiful, or how creativity, imagination, and logical thinking can\nwork together in mathematics. I hope you will see how mathematics is\npart of what our civilization is all about: where we have been and\nwhere we are going, and why, to be a truly educated person, one must have some\nfacility with mathematics.\n\nObjectives: The specific objectives of this course will partly\nbe determined by the students in one of the first assignments. Students\nwill select topics from the book that are of greatest interest to them,\nand the course will be based on what topics are most popular.\n\nHomework: Homework will be assigned twice a week; homework\nassigned on Tuesday will be due on Thursday, and homework assigned on\nThursday will be due on Tuesday. Homework should be turned in at the\nbeginning of class.\n\nLate assignments: No late homework is accepted. Exceptions can\nbe granted, if you must give me notice that you are going to turn in\nan assignment late at least the class before the assignment is due.\nYou must also have a good reason. These reasons will be treated on a\ncase-by-case basis. When you obtain permission to turn in an\nassignment late, we will discuss a new due date for that homework.\n\nCollaboration: You are encouraged to collaborate on all homework\nassignments, unless otherwise specified. This means you work on it\nindependently before discussing it with each other, and it means you\nmust thoroughly understand how to do the problem before writing it up.\nYou must write up your answers separately; you cannot turn in one\nhomework for more than one person, nor can you simply include\nphotocopies of other students' work. There is no limit to the size\nof a group for collaboration, although 3-5 people tends to be an efficient\nsize.\n\nComments: You should include comments about the class at the top\nof your homework assignments. These comments can be ``This class is\ngoing too fast'', ``I like this section'', ``This is too easy/hard'',\n``Can we have more connections to music'', ``Everything's\nokay'', and so on. You will not be graded on these comments, but they\nwill affect how I teach the class, and may make the class more\nenjoyable for you.\n\nClass participation: You are expected to actively participate in\nclass. Many students view learning as a passive act, where the\nteacher takes the only active role, and the student simply listens, or\nat most takes notes. This view is not advisable in this class. Here,\nyou will need to take an active role in learning the material. {\\em\nYou} are in charge of your education, and {\\em you} should take\nresponsibility to learn the material as thoroughly as you can.\n\nThis is especially true in this class. As you will discover, this\nclass is not a lecture-style class, where I simply proclaim information\nto you and you record the information in your notes. Rather, we will\nbe engaged in mathematics discovery together.\n\nTen percent of your grade is based on my estimate of your class\nparticipation throughout the term. Mostly this is easy points: you\ndon't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged\nin the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make.\nIn fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this\ncourse, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for\nwaiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.\n\nAttendance: Attendance is important. The whole point of the\nclass is for us to discover mathematics together, and you cannot do\nthat if you are not here. Skipping even a single class will mean you\nwill not likely be able to do the work or know what is happening in\nthe next class period. This is not the sort of class where just\nreading the material in the book will allow you to do the work. And, of\ncourse, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points. In\nshort, skip class at your peril.\n\nExams: There will be three midterms, and one final. Each\nmidterm counts for 16% of your grade, and the final counts for 22%.\nHomework counts for 20% and class participation for 10%. the final\nexam grade will substitute for your lowest midterm grade if this is to\nyour advantage. Borderline grades could go either way, depending on\nthe effort I see you put into the class.\n\nMidterms will be during the normal class period. Both midterms and\nfinal will occur in the normal classroom for the class. Dates for\nthese tests are as follows:\n\nI will hold review sessions before each, at a time that is popular with the\nclass.\n\nGrading: A grade of C indicates an ability to do homework-like\nproblems, and memorization of all techniques and definitions. In\norder to receive a B, a student must demonstrate a deeper knowledge of\nthe material, being able to apply the course material to new\ncircumstances where applicable. An A student must demonstrate this\nkind of deep understanding in all of the covered topics, as well as be\nable to draw new conclusions from known facts in a logical manner, and\nmust also demonstrate persistence and dilligence. In the other\ndirection, a grade of D shows only superficial understanding of the material,\nand shows inconsistency to do straightforward problems. An F\ngrade indicates that the student has severe gaps in even superficial\nunderstanding of the material in the course.\n\nFor my part, I commit to approaching this class with a Christian\nattitude, viewing my role as that of a servant, being concerned first\nfor your personal, especially intellectual, development. I\nwill also seek to produce an environment of encouragement and love,\nthat fosters a sense of community and understanding. I commit to reporting\ngrades that accurately and honestly reflect the level of work done in the\nclass, as described in the paragraphs above. I also commit the time I\nspend preparing for this class as to the Lord, and I will pray for all\nindividuals in the class on a regular basis, understanding that even as I\nmay seek to educate, God provides the true transformation.\n\nNote that cell phones and laptops are not allowed during exams, so if\nyour only calculator is a calculator program on your cell phone or\nlaptop, you will want to get a stand-alone calculator, or you will not\nhave one during the exams.\n\nMostly this is easy points: you\ndon't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged\nin the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make.\n\nIn fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this\ncourse, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for\nwaiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.\n\nAnd, of\ncourse, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points.\n\nBorderline grades could go either way, depending on\nthe effort I see you put into the class.", "function_call_score": 16.729068748506332, "segments_extracted": 27, "original_length": 12553, "filtered_length": 9586, "compression_ratio": 0.7636421572532462}

{"text": "Math anxiety has been defined as a feeling of tension and apprehension that arises when someone is faced with manipulating numbers and solving mathematical problems. It is not just associated with academic settings. It can show its ugly head in many ordinary life situations.\n\nIn academic settings, though, math anxiety can cause students to perform poorly on math tests, homework, and just in class generally. Very often, a studentís poor performance in a mathematics class is not just the result of a lack of knowledge. It can be tied to math anxiety as well. Someone with math anxiety is not mentally deficient. But, it can cause a student to lose focus and to lose confidence in mathematical situations, thus impacting future success in mathematical requirements.\n\nMath is linear in nature. In most classes it is possible to skip one chapter and still understand the other material covered. Not so with mathematics. In this discipline a student must learn and understand a process before moving on to the next one. In other words, what you learn in Chapter One is the foundation of what will be taught in Chapter Two.\n\nDonít expect your college math classes to mirror those you had in high school. In a secondary setting, you went to math class every day and were saturated with the materials covered that semester. In college, however, you are expected to learn the same amount of material but in a shorter amount of time with less contact, often, with your instructor. What you had a year to learn in high school will now be covered in about 14 -16 weeks, and you are expected to fully understand it before exiting the class.\n\nRemember, math requires a different mindset. In other classes you may just need to listen, take notes, and then learn the material without really applying what you learned. In math, you will be taking what you have learned and using it to solve equations or a set of problems.\n\nDonít despair! You can do mathematics. In fact, you probably use more math daily than you realize. Balanced a checkbook lately? Doubled a recipe? If math begins to get you down, come to the Learning Assistance Center and let the tutors get you back on track. You can succeed in your math classes!\n\n1. Do I become anxious and forget important concepts during a math test?\n\n3. Do I stop taking notes in class when I get confused?\n\n5. Do I stop working a problem as soon as I get stuck?\n\nIf you answered ďyesĒ to several of them, then you probably do suffer from Math Anxiety.\n\n2. If you must miss a class, ask the instructor if you can attend another section so you can keep up with the work.\n\n5. Get tutoring as soon as you recognize a problem.\n\n8. Study as soon as possible after your class. If you wait too long, you will forget what was covered in class. Try to make consistent study times at a point during the day when you are alert and focused. Have a set start and stop time and stick to it.\n\n11. Form a study group from your classmates. Make sure you choose students who are motivated and disciplined so you can support each other.\n\n13. If you are frustrated with a concept, stop. Get up. Get some fresh air. Come back to it in a few minutes when your mind is clear.\n\n16. Review your notes and homework before you go into class.

{"text": "Before you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1. Without understanding the distributive property, you will find yourself completely lost in a lot of common situations that come up. The distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nThe Basics of Algebra\n\nBefore you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics.\n\nWe need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3.\n\nIf you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6.", "function_call_score": 50.18050541516246, "segments_extracted": 11, "original_length": 2770, "filtered_length": 2847, "compression_ratio": 1.027797833935018}

{"text": "In the words of the author: Before writing my algebra series, it was painfully apparent that my students couldn't relate to the applications in the course. I was plagued with the question, \"What is this good for?\" To try to bridge that gap, I wrote some labs, which facilitated my students in collecting data, finding models via curve fitting, and using the models to make estimates and predictions. My students really loved working with the current, compelling, and authentic data and experiencing how mathematics truly is useful. My students' response was so strong that I decided to write an algebra series. Little did I know that to realize this goal, I would need to embark on a 15-year challenging journey, but the rewards of hearing such excitement from students and faculty across the country has made it all worthwhile! I'm proud to have played even a small role in raising peoples' respect and enthusiasm for mathematics. I have tried to honor my inspiration: by working with authentic data, students can experience the power of mathematics. A random-sample study at my college suggests that I am achieving this goal. The study concludes that students who used my series were more likely to feel that mathematics would be useful in their lives (P-value 0.0061) as well as their careers (P-value 0.024). In addition to curve fitting, my approach includes other types of meaningful modeling, directed-discovery explorations, conceptual questions, and of course, a large bank of skill problems. The curve-fitting applications serve as a portal for students to see the usefulness of mathematics so that they become fully engaged in the class.

{"text": "Why study calculus? Is it because you want to be a doctor, an engineer, a forensic scientist, a biologist, or a mathematician? Or is it because someone told you that it would be \"good for you\"? Well, all of those are certainly legitimate reasons. But if you aren't quite sure \"Why calculus?\" here is another reason: It is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind, and, even more to the point, it is easily accessible to anyone who already has studied algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.\n\nGottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton independently invented Calculus. Although the notation, terminology, and rigor may have changed or been standardized over the years, the concepts that we will study have not changed fundamentally since the work of the co-inventors in the 17th century.\n\nThat calculus is important in real-world applications is not in dispute. In fact, there are so many applications of calculus that studying it really is \"good for you.\" Besides engaging in a worthwhile intellectual endeavor, you will be helping to keep your future career options open. That, from a practical point of view, is not a bad reason at all.\n\nHow to study calculus. Calculus has a lot of rules. We admit it! Find the derivative of this function, or the integral of that. However, you should train yourself to keep the rules in perspective: Always put the concepts first. When you study a given calculus concept, ask yourself three questions:\n\nThe above is what we might call \"high-level thinking.\" It provides a way for you to stay oriented, to know what you are learning, and for what purpose. The rest is in the details, important though they are. The combined process is a lot like using a map to hike through the woods. Yes, you have to look at individual trees and their proximity to local landmarks to find your way, but you always want to keep the map and a compass handy to give an overview of the whole trip. So it goes with the study of calculus concepts. Always know where you are going, the direction to take to get there, and how to accomplish the task. The proof, though, is in getting there!\n\nThe Index page of COD (i.e., the page you see when you go to the web site with your Browser) has a picture of a Leibniz Wheel in the upper left-hand corner. Click on the Leibniz Wheel to find out what it is, and how it represents our philosophy of combining theory with practice in the study of calculus in a computing environment.\n\nLecture pages: All the Lecture pages have the same layout. There is a short statement of the main thrust of the lecture, followed by these items:\n\nQuick Question: This section is intended to get you thinking about the topic. Sometimes you can answer this question before studying the material of the Lecture, other times not. If you have answered the question, you can check its correctness by clicking Answer. If you don't think you know the answer to the Quick Question, it is better to wait and try the question again after you have studied the Textbook section, which should allow you to answer the question. As before you then can check the correctness of your answer by clicking Answer.\n\nTextbook: Here you will find a link to on-line material from a textbook. At present, we are using the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. When you click on the topic in the Textbook section of the Lecture page, you will get a list of the material from the sections of this book corresponding to the COD topics. If you click a topic, you will launch an Acrobat Reader pdf file that will display the text on-line. You can open the link for the Lecture you are working on or for any other topic if there is something you have forgotten and want to review, or if you want to peek ahead. The textbook material will open in a separate window so that you can leave it open on your desktop while you are going through the rest of the lecture.\n\nToday's Homework: The link here will take you to the WeBWorK login page. If you do not have a password, you can sign in as a practice user with practice1 as both the user name and password. If \"practice1\" is in use, try practice2, or practice3, etc. until you find one that is not in use. After logging in, you will see a page that has the option to \"Begin Problem Sets.\" After selecting it, you will see a list of homework sets that are listed by day. For example, the homework set \"Setm3f02day04\" corresponds to the homework for COD Lecture 4. Similarly, \"Setm3f02day13\" is the homework for COD Lecture 13. Ignore the fact that the sets all say \"CLOSED;\" this just means that the answers are available, and that WeBWorK will not retain your answer once you log off. However, by choosing a problem set and \"getting a problem\" you may input your answers and WeBWorK will tell you if you are right or wrong. You could also get a copy of the problem set (in pdf).\n\nYou may not want to do the homework until you have looked at some Examples and tried the on-line Quiz. This will be true if you are studying the material for the first time. In that case, you should look at the Examples, take the Quiz, and review the Textbook material as necessary before turning to the homework exercises. For those students who have seen the material before, there is nothing wrong with going directly to the homework. You can always come back later to the examples and quiz as needed.\n\nApplets: These carry out little computer programs that illustrate a calculus idea or provide a tool to implement a calculus procedure. Look at and experiment with them. They are meant to help you learn the material better, or to function much like advanced calculators. Don't be shy. Have fun with them.\n\nThere is also a link to past Math 3 exams (covering Lectures 1-10, 11-19; and the course final). This link is called Practice Exams and should be used as such to test your understanding of blocks of the COD Lectures. There is also a Textbook Home Page link to the home page of the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. Here you will find section-pages that give links to calculus resources on the World Wide Web. And finally, there is a link to the Post a Comment page that we discuss below.\n\nWhat do you do if you have a problem? If you are studying calculus in a classroom setting, you can talk to other students or to the teacher. However, if you are studying on your own, you can Post a Comment using the bottom link on the green sidebar of a lecture-page. There you can communicate with other students who also are studying calculus on-line. You could either state your problem and ask for help, or you may find that someone has already answered that or a similar question. You may even find questions that you can answer for other students. We encourage you to look at the Post a Comment section of COD on a regular basis.\n\nHowever, you should train yourself to keep the rules in perspective: Always put the concepts first.\n\nAlways know where you are going, the direction to take to get there, and how to accomplish the task.\n\nThere is a short statement of the main thrust of the lecture, followed by these items:\n\nQuick Question: This section is intended to get you thinking about the topic.\n\nWhen you click on the topic in the Textbook section of the Lecture page, you will get a list of the material from the sections of this book corresponding to the COD topics.\n\nYou could also get a copy of the problem set (in pdf).\n\nAnd finally, there is a link to the Post a Comment page that we discuss below.\n\nHowever, if you are studying on your own, you can Post a Comment using the bottom link on the green sidebar of a lecture-page.\n\nWe encourage you to look at the Post a Comment section of COD on a regular basis.", "function_call_score": 21.619944139857246, "segments_extracted": 22, "original_length": 9667, "filtered_length": 7746, "compression_ratio": 0.801282714389159}

Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions.

{"text": "In Spain, it is well known that secondary school students' motivation to study Science (especially Mathematics) is not very strong. This is a common problem to almost all Europe. Spanish and Andalusian governments have general policies on education to promote the study of Science. They are necessary and convenient. However, we think that local actions in the students' environment, which supplement these policies, are also needed.\nFor this reason, five years ago we founded at the University of Almería an online free journal called Boletín de la Titulación de Matemáticas de la UAL ( mainly addressed to those students. Our intention is to stimulate their interest in mathematics, to develop their mathematical skills, to complement their background, and to improve their perception and assessment of mathematics. Many aspects, usually out of the syllabus, are treated to provide a closer, more real and positive image of mathematics. Another aim is to encourage a closer contact between secondary schools and our university. Although these are our main goals, we do not discard a broader audience and often include articles appropriate for a general public.\nIt is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc. We do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country.\nBoletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world.\nThis project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system. There are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools. The secondary school students are, as said, the main target of this project, and they can participate through the mathematical contest that we pose. There exists a closer contact later in the prize award ceremony at the winner's secondary school. In such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers. No doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience. Regarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called \"Territorio Estudiante\" (Student Area).\nThe journal is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course (October, January and April). Its length is around 20-25 pages and papers published must be short and suitable for a secondary school level. It is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:\n\nFrom Secondary School to University, containing teaching experiences, learning Maths in a foreign language, solutions to the university entrance exam Maths problems, etc.\n\nThe editorial committee consists of 3 main editors and 29 section editors, composed by professors of the University of Almería and teachers from secondary schools of our province, and 4 undergraduate students in charge of the student area. Although our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province. For example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues.\nTo spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes.\nSeveral facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect. We are very interested in knowing if our efforts to bring the Mathematics closer to young people and teachers in schools are useful. Among the methods to know this we use:\n\nNumber of visits that we pay to secondary schools and feedback from them since this quantity points out the interest that the Boletín arouses.\n\nIn conclusion, with the invaluable help of our journal we have set up a reliable atmosphere between professors from our university and teachers from secondary schools in our region of influence. This has permitted to develop other activities jointly such as meetings about mathematical education (I Jornada del Profesorado de Almería,  or the group Almería Matemática in Facebook. Our Maths students at the university benefited from this and there is a growing interest among secondary school students in studying the degree in Mathematics at the University of Almería.", "function_call_score": 23.46494309400028, "segments_extracted": 5, "original_length": 7117, "filtered_length": 5226, "compression_ratio": 0.7342981593367992}

{"text": "The Connected Mathematics Program (CMP2) used by the sixth and seventh grades and the College Preparatory Mathematics (CPM) algebra I curriculum used by the eighth grade are rich with areas inviting additional insights and open to diverse methods of problem-solving, creating an open-ended structure that is more permissive of individual differences. While much of the content of these programs is parallel to that of standard middle school textbooks, how students learn and the role of the teacher in their learning may be significantly different.\n\nOur mathematics courses support a philosophy of teaching and learning in which the teacher is a facilitator of learning rather than a dispenser of knowledge, and the students are active participants in constructing and explaining mathematics. Activities promote mathematical reasoning, problem-solving, and communication skills. Students work in small and large groups as well as individually to explore concepts, make conjectures, and form generalizations. They learn to respect and value other opinions as they create and eagerly present a variety of approaches and solutions to problems. In so doing, students have an opportunity to experience mathematics in meaningful and challenging ways while obtaining a solid conceptual basis for further study in mathematics.\n\nThe CMP series in both sixth and seventh grade consists of several units, each developing a major mathematical concept through a series of investigations. The problems are designed to allow students to uncover the mathematics that is embedded in the situation. The sixth grade year begins with Prime Time, where students explore number theory and concepts involving factors, multiples, primes, and composites. From there, the first of three units focusing on rational numbers, Bits and Pieces 1, provides opportunities for understanding fractions, decimals and percents. Subsequent units on rational numbers interspersed between other topics deal with operations and applications. Other topics include a geometry unit that promotes reasoning about shapes, as well as properties of these shapes and their angles, as well as a measurement unit that emphasizes area and perimeter relationships of both regular and irregular, curved, and straight-sided figures.\n\nIn seventh grade, the students study pre-algebra, beginning with Variables and Patterns, which is an introduction to algebra, using tables, graphs and symbols as representations. Similarity concepts are developed in Stretching and Shrinking before exploring rate, ratio, proportion, percent, and proportional reasoning in Comparing and Scaling. Through activities from Accentuate the Negative, students develop an understanding and use of integers before Moving Straight Ahead highlights linear relationships expressed in words, tables, graphs, and symbols. The study of volume and 3-D measurement in Filling and Wrapping extends our study of geometry before concluding the year with What do You Expect, a unit on probability.\n\nAlthough those represent some of the mathematical topics for each year, the changes we hope to see in your children go beyond acquiring the fundamentals of algebra. We hope that they develop a greater sense of involvement and excitement about mathematical thinking, a greater sense of confidence and trust in their own abilities, a greater ability to clearly explain their thoughts and procedures both in writing and in conversation, and a greater awareness of the diverse skills and approaches that are embraced in mathematics and that can be discovered in each student.", "function_call_score": 16.674495068107092, "segments_extracted": 5, "original_length": 4258, "filtered_length": 3570, "compression_ratio": 0.8384217942696102}

{"text": "DESCRIPTION: The unit on graphing linear equations will begin with\nstudents learning to manipulate an equation into slope-intercept form. This will be accomplished through\nclassroom discussion and guided practice from an overhead projector and the chalkboard. Students will then\nhave independent practice with a lesson from their algebra text. Another series of lessons will follow on\ngraphing equations and the various methods of graphing a linear equation.\n\nThe proposed lesson will follow\nafter becoming familiar with slope intercept form, manipulating an equation, and graphing equations.\nStudents will participate in a cooperative learning activity of matching a graphic display with an\nequation. A Kagan Activity; corner; will then be used for students to practice graphing an equation. After\nthe review students will reinforce the concepts learned through the use of a graphing calculator. Future\nconcepts such as parallel and perpendicular lines will also be introduced. Through the use of a LitePro\nand one computer, students will be introduced in the classroom to the computer program, Green Globs and\nGraphing Equations. Students will then move to the computer lab and work individually on the tutorial\nand game. Upon completion of the game, students will then complete an Internet lesson on the applications\nof the concepts learned. Students will communicate their understanding of the concepts learned through a\njournal entry as well as other methods.\n\nWorking in groups of three or\nfour, students will each take an equation and create the graphic display for their equation. Then\nstudents will regroup so that one from each original group will now be working with others with the\nsame equation; students will do a peer assessment. Students return to their original group and take\nturns showing their group members how they arrived at their graphic display. All students are to\ncomplete each graphic as it is explained. This is a Spencer Kagan activity entitled, corners. Each\nstudentsí graphics are turned in to the teacher.\n\nUsing graphing calculators\nstudents will extend their investigations of linear equations. Students will draw conclusions about\nslope and y-intercept. The concept of parallel and perpendicular lines will be introduced.\n\nThe computer program Green\nGlobs & Graphing Equations (Sunburst) will be used to reinforce the concept of\nslope-intercept form. The software will be introduced in the classroom with the use of an LCD\nProjector. In a lab setting students will be given 20 levels of lines to identify the equation. For\neach line given, students are to give the equation in slope-intercept form. If a student does not\nget the equation correct, a red line is graphed for his/her equation so that the student can see if\nthey have the slope correct or maybe the intercept is what is wrong. Students are given unlimited\nchances on writing the equation for the line; however, they must get an equation correct for each\nlevel the first time in order to advance to the next level. I have created a record-keeping sheet in\nwhich students keep up with how many times they incorrectly write an equation. After completing the\nlesson, students will then play the game Green Globs in which they are to write an equation\nfor lines that will hit as many globs as possible with one line in order to get points. Students\nbecome very interested in slope and intercepts at this point, and they also become very competitive.\nThe program has a record keeping system for the top ten scores.\n\nUsing the Internet as a\nresource, students will gather data to create a graphic display and experience a real world\napplication of the use of linear equations. Students will be supplied with other possible sites they\nmay visit which will reinforce the algebraic concepts covered in this lesson.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nThe matching of a linear equation with the graphic display. Peer-assessment will occur during the Kagan\nActivity, corners. Self-assessment will be done from the visual display of the overhead calculator. A\nrubric will be used for Green Globs & Graphing Equations tutorial. The Internet lesson and\njournal entry will be assessed by the teacher. Students will also be assessed through out the course on\nthis concept.\n\nI like using the LitePro projector\nto take the students on a virtual field trip in the classroom prior to turning them loose on their own\nwith the computer. This takes care of a lot of questions later.\n\nStudent Characteristics: All students learn at different rates and through\ndifferent modes so for that reason I have tried to make this lesson as well-rounded as possible in that we\nstill do concrete and abstract activities as well as thinking.

{"text": "Cabri 3D is one of dynamic geometry software. This software helps students with the visualization of 3D figures their properties. The purpose of this software is to help students to better understand three-dimensional space, since three-dimensional space is difficult to visualize. Cabri 3D allows students and teachers to construct and manipulate solid geometry objects in three dimensions. It provides a tool for teachers and students to explore properties of 3D geometric constructions\n\nEven though it is Cabri 3D, two dimensions objects can still be created. The software is suitable with many two dimensions concepts such as length, sectors of circles, lateral area, surface area. Cabri 3D will help students to learn analyzing characteristics and properties of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes and develop arguments of mathematics about geometrical relationships. Students also can learn to use visualization, spatial reasoning, and geometric modeling to solve problems\n\nCabri 3D is appropriate for secondary school students. Even though the software is not very user friendly, the students can be successful with the program if they learn through the manual. Teachers who want to use it in their classes have to be advanced in using it. Even though the software is not user friendly, it still offers a lot of great features that help student to get success in learning mathematics especially in geometry class.\n\nOne of strength of the WebQuest is its introduction provides information that engages students to explore further. It is started with interesting issues. This issue will grab students' attention. Another strength is its link to supported documents such as vector form. Moreover, it also provides various web sites such as .com, .edu and .gov. Some of the links take students directly to pages they need to go.\n\nI am curious to learn and assess computer technology for learning mathematics and science. Even though there are many issues surround the using of computer technology in learning mathematics and science, computer technology offers new ways to learn. It helps students to learn based on problem solving. Another advantage is by using computer technology teachers can create inquiry-based mathematics and science classroom. Of course, besides those things, There are many other advantages of using computer technology in learning mathematics and science.\n\nOne of software that I am interested to learn is TinkerPlots. TinkerPlots is software for students in grades 4 through 8. The use of software is to build fluency with data representation and exploration. Animation, color, and dynamic manipulation support students in moving from simple representations to increasingly complex and analytic graphs. Another aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data. TinkerPlots also helps teachers to create inquiry-based mathematics classrooms\n\nSpeech Recognition. Windows 7 has a feature that allows people to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. It is Speech Recognition. We can find this feature on Ease of Access. Before we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer. There are some issues that we have to think about before using Speech Recognition: (1) Speech Recognition needs a good microphone. (2) Training the computer to identify the speaker sounds and pronunciation. (3) Speak clearly and pronounce words carefully, not too fast and or too slow. To open Speech Recognition: (1)Start the Speech Recognition by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking Ease of Access, and then clicking Windows Speech Recognitions. (2)Click microphone button to start the listening mode\n\nBy using Speech Recognition we can do the following things: (1) We can use our voice to control our computer. (2) We can say commands that the computer will respond (3) We can dictate text to the computer.\n\nSpeech Recognition makes a classroom or lesson more Universally Designed. Speech recognition allows students to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. This feature is useful to students with a wide range of disabilities including those with visual, mobility and language impairments. This feature will be very useful in a classroom which the numbers of students with disabilities integrated into it. Today, nearly every class and schoolwork are related to computer. For example statistics class, students will analyze graphical displays of data, including dot plots, stem plots, and histograms, to identify and describe patterns and departures from patterns. In this class they will use computer to create graphical displays. By using Speech recognition and Microsoft excel, students with mobility impairment are still able to participate well in the class. They can input data and command to create a graphic.\n\nSpeech Recognition helps students with mobility and visual impairment. Students with mobility impairments might be unable to use (or be without) arms or fingers to interact with their computers using a standard keyboard or mouse. Using their voice is a way to interact with their computer. By using speech recognition they can operate their computer and compose text. Another is visual impairment, blindness, for example. Students who are blind interact with their computers through keyboards, Braille devices, and audio/voice rather than a traditional monitor and mouse. If they don't have these special devices, they are still able to operate their computer by using Speech Recognition.\n\nConclusion A more accessible technology is good for everyone, including students with disabilities and students without disability. All students benefit from technology in which it is easier to function. Providing accessible technology in the classroom to students with disabilities enables all students to have the same opportunities in education. Speech Recognition gives an easy way to interact with computer not only for students with a disability but also those without a disability. It also helps us to make an inclusive classroom with equal access for all students.\n\nMathematics is my subject domain, during I taught mathematics I used some dynamic geometry software, such as Cabry, Geometer's Sketchpad, GeoGebra and Autograph. These are typically used in the classroom or the computer lab and they are very helpful in teaching the difficult concept.\n\nIt is little bit difficult to find an appropriate technology device in everyday life for teaching and learning the difficult concept of mathematics. Since mathematics concept is completely different from other concepts such as social science, English, etc.Based on my teaching experience in primary school, when I teach a difficult concept, I had to prove the concept and visualized it. these things can be done by using a software for teaching mathematics that requires a certain specification of a computer.\n\nHowever, Nowadays, there is a technology in education known as mobile learning. Mobile Learning is a learning model adopted cellular technology development and mobile phones where this technology can be used as a learning medium. To use this technology, we can download the applications and install them on a mobile phone or use them online by using mobile phone.\n\nMobile learning technology can be used to teach mathematics. One of web sites that provides mobile learning applications for teaching and learning mathematics is  So far, Mobile Learning is very helpful as a supplement material for teaching mathematics. It is easy for students to bring mobile phones wherever they go, this technology will help them to learn mathematics wherever and whenever.\n\nEven though the software is not user friendly, it still offers a lot of great features that help student to get success in learning mathematics especially in geometry class.\n\nAnother aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data.\n\nBefore we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer.", "function_call_score": 32.11446740858506, "segments_extracted": 18, "original_length": 9435, "filtered_length": 8018, "compression_ratio": 0.8498145204027557}

{"text": "Let's talk variables. Do we want students to develop an understanding of variable concepts (whether in a developmental math course or not)? Is accurate use of variable notation enough? If students can model applications and accurately determine solutions … is that enough? Is there a role for linguistic literacy in mathematics?\n\nOne of the issues we face in college is dealing (or not) with prior learning. Without intervention, prior learning (even when inaccurate) survives — often surviving in the face of conflicting information in the current learning environment. Visualize the prior learning as being as a stable mass of 'knowledge' (even though it has gaps and errors); as students go through a class as adults, information that connects positively with the old reinforces the old. When new information does not connect or conflicts with the old, the low-energy (natural) response is to build new storage … resulting in that solid core being supplemented by weak veneers of new knowledge. This, of course, is an incomplete visualization for the actual processes in the human brain. The suggestion is that students approach a math class with an attitude that supports old information and minimizes cognitive effort for dealing with new or incompatible information.\n\nIn my beginning algebra class this week, we did the test on exponents and polynomials. Although the test includes some artificially difficult problems with negative exponents, most of the items deal with important ideas. One of the most basic items on the test was this:\n\nNow, this is a good class — all students are actually doing homework and attending class almost every day. We had dealt with the first situation at the start of the semester. How could these errors survive to this point?\n\nBoth errors are based on variable as a symbol to be replaced by a number, which is not complete. They might represent a visual approach, not verbal. Variables represent quantities involved in sums and products, where products with variables are implied … and more than this. Simplifying expressions might — or might not — uncover the incomplete understanding. What can I do to help students with this?\n\nI am planning on incorporating some linguistic activities around variables in the first week of the semester. Some of the ideas are from a old book called \"English Skills for Algebra\" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print. The authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students. Some of their activities involve listening to somebody read mathematical statements and the student writing them down. I think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).\n\nI do know that just saying \"that was wrong … this is right\" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding. I need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables. Some energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together. Without that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.\n\n(1) The concept of \"variable\" is a means towards an end. It should thus not be surprising that to \"teach an understanding of variable\" does not work. It cannot.\n\nIn a developmental context, the obvious end is the discussion of function: we need a paper representation for what we input.\n\nThus, my attempt in could not work because, as I eventually realized and mentioned in , I should have had—and will have real soon now—a \"Chapter 3 – Functions\".\n\n(2) The usual definition of powers does not work very well in the remedial situation. For something that works, see freemathtexts.org\n\nThus, 5(3b)^2 should be read as \"5 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 5•3b•3b, and the default rule \"when there is no coefficient, it goes without saying that it is 1″ lets us read (3b)^2 as \"1 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 1•3b•3b.\n\n(3) Re \"linguistic activities\", what is very likely to work is having the mathematics text used as the reading material in a remedial English reading course. Of course, the text cannot be the usual prescriptive stuff (that takes students for idiots) but one that has faith in the ability of the students to be receptive to arguments.\n\nI need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables.\n\nSome energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together.", "function_call_score": 22.862823061630216, "segments_extracted": 15, "original_length": 5030, "filtered_length": 4858, "compression_ratio": 0.9658051689860835}

{"text": "Mathematics majors typically begin their college mathematics studies with three semesters of Calculus. Calculus is both the cornerstone of \"analysis,\" one of the major branches of pure mathematics, and an indispensable tool for most of the sciences and engineering. Students learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right. Students study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.\n\nAll mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year. This basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, \"algebra\" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications. In linear algebra, the study of linear equations, like those in beginning high school algebra -- but with the possibility of thousands of equations in thousands of unknowns -- leads to abstract mathematical spaces.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a variety of more advanced courses. Students decide which of these to take according to their interests and the particular degree which they seek.\nFor example, students apply multivariable calculus in probability and the mathematical foundations of statistical inference in Theory of Statistics. Related choices include Statistical Methods and Introduction to Experimental Designs, in which one learns how to collect and analyze data, for instance in scientific and industrial experiments.\n\nSimilarly, students can choose mathematics courses with special significance in computer science. A prime example is Applied Graph Theory, featuring mathematical models and algorithms applicable to such problems as traffic systems, activity scheduling, and design layout. Others are Cryptography (how to encrypt data securely) and Coding Theory (how to send messages that self-correct transmission errors).\n\nOther courses in applied mathematics emphasize mathematical theory and problem solving methods directed toward the physical sciences and engineering. An illustrative example at the junior level is Partial Differential Equations involving several variables (e.g., both space and time). They describe such phenomena as the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space, and the flow of heat in solids.\n\nCourses in pure mathematics concentrate upon the theoretical foundations of algebra, calculus, and other elementary courses, and at the same time point the way toward more advanced topics in modern mathematics. To illustrate, students in Real Variables (or theoretical advanced calculus) learn why the facts and computational methods learned in ordinary calculus are correct; in Modern Algebra, students study various abstract systems which include the familiar objects of school mathematics as special cases (whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, etc.)\n\nIn addition to taking many courses in the major field of study, every undergraduate at Wright State University is required to take a comprehensive program of General Education studies, including courses in history, English, economics, the sciences, and several other disciplines. Moreover, some degree programs allow students to take \"free electives,\" or courses chosen by students from essentially any area.

How fast is a car going if it accelerates for ten miles per hour every second for 20 seconds? How far has it traveled?

{"text": "The United States is one of the only countries in the world that is teaching courses with names like Algebra I or Algebra II. The rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school. In the United States, some schools offer an alternative, such as an integrated program that incorporates algebra as a strand blended with geometry and other advanced topics. Others continue to offer a course sequence that includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. In an increasing number of states, the study of algebra in some form is required of all students for high school graduation. Regardless of whether a school's secondary curriculum includes a separate course in Algebra I or is more integrated, we can take concrete steps to ensure that students will flourish and succeed when they arrive at the formal study of algebra. A key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.\n\nAlgebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change. Of course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems. But trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure. Algebraic thinking can begin when students begin their study of mathematics.\n\nAt the earliest grades, young children work with patterns. At an early age, children have a natural love of mathematics, and their curiosity is a strong motivator as they try to describe and extend patterns of shapes, colors, sounds, and eventually letters and numbers. And at a young age, children can begin to make generalizations about patterns that seem to be the same or different. This kind of categorizing and generalizing is an important developmental step on the journey toward algebraic thinking.\n\nThroughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well. As students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3. As they explore and understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they can look for patterns that help them learn procedures and facts. Patterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense. Patterns within the multiplication table itself are interesting to children and help them both learn their facts and understand relationships among facts. The process of noticing and exploring patterns sets the stage for looking at more complex relationships, including proportionality, in later grades.\n\nAs students move into the middle grades, their mathematics experience can focus on connecting their work with numbers and operations to more symbolic work with equations and expressions. At this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum. This concept should take students well beyond the study of ratios, proportions, and percent. A real understanding of proportionality allows students to connect their experience with numbers and operations to ideas that they have studied in geometry, measurement, and data analysis. They begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.\n\nA solid understanding of proportionality sets the stage for students to succeed in the more formal study of algebra. From this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally. As students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them. Looking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.\n\nThe development of algebraic thinking is a process, not an event. It is something that can be part of a positive, motivating, enriching school mathematics experience. \"Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School\" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year. Watch for opportunities to develop your own understanding of this important topic throughout the year, including as part of conferences, journals, publications, and the NCTM Web site.\n\nFor this month's questions, consider the following: How can we build algebraic thinking into the pre-K–12 curriculum at all levels? How should secondary school mathematics be organized to capitalize on the inclusion of algebraic thinking throughout the elementary and middle grades? What can NCTM do to support teachers in fostering the development of algebraic thinking?\n\nPatterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense.\n\nThey begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.", "function_call_score": 18.544683857294242, "segments_extracted": 10, "original_length": 5662, "filtered_length": 5396, "compression_ratio": 0.9530201342281879}

{"text": "Get to know your calculator early in any math course. Calculators are used for most routine arithmetic calculations now, and your ability to use a calculator will help to complete work accurately and efficiently.\n\nWhile calculators come in many different makes and model numbers, most of them operate in similar manners. The notes here are specifically intended to assist you in becoming familiar with the Texas Instruments' TI-30X or TI-30Xa, but you should find the same function keys on many other scientific calculator.\n\nFor most algebra courses, you will need a scientific calculator. A scientific calculator includes functions for LOG, LN, and exponents, among other useful keys. It also performs arithmetic according to the Order of Operations (a calculator with only the arithmetic operations +, -,, and ¸ probably performs operations sequentially and is not useful for any advanced mathematical work). The TI-30X calculators are scientific calculators.\n\nDo not worry if there are several keys you don't understand right now. This calculator will serve you well throughout your math courses, even to Calculus and beyond. Anytime you learn some new mathematics, try to learn how to use your calculator to go with it.\n\nKnow how to turn your calculator on and off (the solar model has no OFF; there are no batteries to conserve). Some calculators have an automatic shut off if not used for a few minutes. On the TI-30X, the ON button is the top right key. This is also the All Clear (AC) button, which effectively gives you a clean slate to work with. AC clears the screen to \"0\", clears all memories, and turns off special features (like statistical mode). Use AC only when you want a fresh start. Avoid using AC in the middle of an exercise.\n\nEvery key has a number, operation or function name printed on top of the button. This is the primary function for that key. These are likely the ones you will use most often. The primary functions are grouped, more or less, according to purpose.\n\nThese are the keys for entering numbers digit-by-digit. Use the key for entering a number with a decimal point, like 2.57. Use the key to change the sign of a number from positive to negative, or vice versa. This is most useful for entering negative numbers: simply type in the number, then press to make it negative. It is important to use the negative sign after typing the number, because -0 is just 0.\n\nThese are the basic operations of (from top to bottom) division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. These may be typed in the order written in an exercise, and the calculator will automatically perform the entire calculation according to the required order of operations once the key is pressed. Use the key only at the end of your calculation, and press it exactly once (no more).\n\nInclude parentheses (as written) in any arithmetic exercise. The parentheses keys may be used for any pair of grouping symbols, including \"(...)\" or \"[...]\" or \"{...}\". Type the parentheses just as they appear in your exercise. You may also need parentheses at times when they are not shown. For example, a fraction with more than just a number in the numerator or denominator may be enclosed in parentheses for quick entry. Try to compute by typing .\n\nAs described earlier, the button clears all previous entries and settings. Use this key when you start, but rarely afterwards. In the middle of calculations, is a better option. Pressed once, this key means \"Clear Error\". Use it to correct an incorrect number as you type during a longer entry. For example, suppose you are trying to calculate 28 (16) + 42, and you typed (but you notice this should have been 16, not 26). Press once to clear just the last number entry. Then type in the correct entry and the rest of the calculation: . You should get the answer 490.\n\nIf you typed well beyond the mistake, then press twice (to activate \"Clear\"). This clears the entire calculation from the screen, so you can start over. For example, in the above calculation, suppose you typed before noticing that the 26 should have been 16. Press and start over: .\n\nOne other option (and a good one), is to make use of the backspace key. This key erases only the last digit typed. Press it once or more to get back to the mistaken digit, and then resume your calculation. Having typed , press the backspace twice, then continue with 16 to get the correct answer. Note that the backspace will only erase digits, not operations.\n\ngives the reciprocal of the number on the screen. Literally, this is 1 divided by x. Mathematically, 1/x is also the same as x-1. On some calculators, the key is . For example, to quickly change 1/200 to a decimal, type . The screen will show 0.005. Likewise, to find 50-1, type to get 0.02.\n\nThe memory keys allow you to save up to three different numbers for later use. To save the number currently on the display, type . This \"stores\" the value in memory cell 1 (replace with or to use memories 2 or 3, respectively). To \"recall\" a number stored in memory cell 1, use . To try this out, let's compute x2 - 17x + 5, using the memory cell 1 for x when x = -3.217. First enter the number, change the sign to negative, and store it in cell 1 as follows: . Then type in the computation, using for each occurrence of the variable x:\n\nDo not forget to include the \"times\" symbol between \"17\" and \"x\" in the middle term. The answer displayed should be 70.038089.\n\nYou have probably noticed by now that the calculator also has writing just above each key. To save space, the calculator was made so that each key can perform two separate functions. The primary function is labeled directly on the key as is used simply by pressing the desired key (everything we have discussed so far is a primary function). To activate a secondary function, first press and then the key below the name of the desired function. A few commonly used secondary functions are, , and .\n\nfinds roots of any index. This is really just the opposite of the exponent key. Enter the number under the radical, press the key, then enter the index of the root. Press if finished, or continue the calculation. To compute , enter . Note that the key changes the meaning of the key to . You should get 12 for the answer.\n\nAbove the fraction key is the improper fraction function . This is nice for converting a mixed number into a pure fraction (although called improper, a single fraction with any numerator and denominator is usually easier to use in algebraic expressions than the equivalent mixed number). In the section on fractions, we did a calculation that gave the answer . This can be converted to a pure fraction by pressing , which activates the secondary function and displays the fraction . Written as a fraction rather than a mixed number, the answer is .\n\nAnother related secondary function is , above the backspace key. The label stands for Fraction-to-Decimal. By pressing this key, any fraction on the displayed will be changed to its decimal form. If the display is a decimal number, the calculator will try to write the number as a fraction, but this is not always possible. So if the decimal number remains, then there is no simple equivalent fraction (remember that the calculator can only do fractions with 3-digit numbers). For example, convert to a decimal just by pressing . You should see 4.6 on the display. Press again to change the answer back to fraction form (you get because the calculator prefers mixed number form). Press to get back to the pure fraction form .\n\nare keys you won't be needing until a College Algebra or Calculus course or beyond. You will learn about the keys for the logarithmic and trigonometric functions later. Most of the secondary function keys are used for probability and statistics.\n\nGet to know your calculator early in any math course.\n\nPress it once or more to get back to the mistaken digit, and then resume your calculation.\n\nHaving typed , press the backspace twice, then continue with 16 to get the correct answer.\n\nLikewise, to find 50-1, type to get 0.\n\nYou should get 12 for the answer.\n\nPress again to change the answer back to fraction form (you get because the calculator prefers mixed number form).\n\nPress to get back to the pure fraction form.", "function_call_score": 18.829740431148263, "segments_extracted": 27, "original_length": 11365, "filtered_length": 8190, "compression_ratio": 0.7206335239771228}

Adequate time is allowed to complete the homework check provided the student has completed his or her assignment.\n\nStudents will assume the responsibility to find out what work and notes you missed while absent and that you complete those tasks promptly. After your return to school, you will be allowed one day per day absent to complete all missing material. If you miss a homework check, then expect to turn in the appropriate assignment in its place.

{"text": "The College Prep math curriculum focuses on building a strong conceptual base that helps students to become flexible thinkers, able to apply the mathematics they have learned to a rapidly changing world.\n\nMath teachers have designed materials for incremental learning and to address a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Students learn concepts and skills by solving carefully sequenced problems; in class, students often work in cooperative groups. Teachers coordinate courses and review frequently so students retain important ideas from year to year. Instead of separate courses in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, all three areas are addressed in each course of an integrated curriculum. Course materials introduce applications to science and other related fields and provide historical context.\n\nCalculators and computers are important tools of modern mathematics. Teachers instruct students in their appropriate use, but also require a firm grasp of basic skills. Students are required to solve many problems without using calculators. The Math Department uses placement examinations, recommendations, and interviews to ensure that each student enrolls in the most suitable course sequence. Almost all students take four years of mathematics, even though only three are required. Math Club meets regularly to share ideas and investigate problems beyond the scope of the normal curriculum. All interested students are welcome to participate. The club also provides opportunities for students to take part in local and national mathematics competitions.\n\nConcepts and applications of algebra, problem solving, and geometry are the main topics in this course, designed to prepare students with diverse mathematical backgrounds for Math II. Students learn how to use the scientific calculator to solve problems and use manipulatives extensively to develop spatial visualization skills. They often work together in small groups in the classroom, developing their collaborative skills and their ability to explain mathematics clearly. Students review and practice algebra skills in a wide variety of situations. Topics include proportional reasoning, geometric similarity and transformations, area and perimeter, linear and quadratic equations, and introductory statistics and probability. This course is coordinated with Integrated Laboratory Science.\n\nThis course covers topics from geometry and algebra. The curriculum encourages connections among topics by continually interweaving them. Emphasis is placed on the development of geometric intuition, deductive logic, proof, and a strong foundation in algebra. Group work is encouraged; activities are done in groups, sometimes with physical models and or computers. Class discussions and group activities enrich the learning experience by developing problem-solving and communication skills.\n\nThe concept of function serves as a framework for this course. Mathematical modeling (deriving a mathematical expression from real-world data) is introduced, and students do experiments and use graphing calculators to gather information. Students purchase a course-specific graphing calculator and are instructed in its use. Algebraic skills are practiced within the context of solving problems, and geometric interpretations and graphing are emphasized. Students continue the study of linear and quadratic equations begun in Math I and Math II, adding new functions to their repertoire: polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms. This course is offered at two levels: Math IlIA and Math III. Both are college preparatory and cover functions and applications. Math IIIA is accelerated, covering topics usually included in algebra honors, trigonometry and precalculus. It prepares students for Level IIC of the College Board SAT Subject Test in Mathematics. Math III covers topics normally taught in advanced algebra and trigonometry.\n\nThis course begins with material from pre-calculus, including a study of functions (polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric) and their graphs. It continues with topics in analytic geometry, linear algebra, vectors and discrete mathematics. The course introduces topics from calculus, such as limits, continuity and derivatives and their applications. Students learn the material through lecture, group work, and homework.\n\nThis\ncourse explores topics across a broad spectrum, including pre-calculus,\ncalculus, economics, finance, and statistics. The emphasis will be on\napplications of mathematics to a variety of fields. In the first semester, we\nwill introduce some of the ideas of set theory, statistics (linear regression\nmodels), economics (supply, demand) and finance (including simple and compound\ninterest). Second semester, we will continue with more finance (annuities and\nloan amortization), probability, single variable statistics (normal curve\ndistributions) and calculus (limits, rates of change, derivatives, and\nintegrals). The goal is to expose students to a variety of techniques and\napplications that will be useful in diverse academic pursuits as well as life\nin general.\n\nHow accurate are opinion polls? Where is the economy really heading? Can you believe the latest \"study\" about health and diet? The media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is. In Statistics, we look at how data are gathered and presented, and how certain the conclusions drawn from them are likely to be. This means using standard formulas, but we will also look at the math behind the formulas, including probability and its applications. There are lab exercises (sometimes with edible \"equipment\") and mini-projects in which students design and carry out original investigations. There are also informal discussions of items in the news. This two-semester course is equivalent to a semester of statistics in college and prepares students for the AP exam. It may be taken after or at the same time as Applied Math, or Math Analysis and Introductory Calculus.\n\nHigh\nschool math includes many beautiful topics, but there is so much more math that\nis accessible to bright and curious high school students like you that we don't\ninclude in our curriculum. There just isn't time to do it all. For those of you\nhungry for more math, The Art of Problem Solving is for you. It is a\none-semester math elective which will cover topics in arithmetic, number\ntheory, and counting and probability, as well as some algebra and geometry that\nisn't already covered in Math I, II, or III/IIIA. Students must have completed\nMath III/IIIA or equivalent to enroll. You don't have to like math contests to\ntake this course, but if you do like them, this course might help you improve\nyour scores. However, the best reason to take this course is that you will\nlearn new math, and equally importantly, it will be interesting and fun.\n\nThe media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is.

{"text": "GEOMETRY '11-'12 MRS. ELROD COURSE OUTLINE AND CLASSROOM POLICIES Hi! Welcome to another great year at Buena High School! Please read through the information below, keep it available in your binder, and sign and return the tear-off part. 1. Course Description: Geometry is a College-Preparatory course designed to introduce students to rigorous upper level mathematics. Geometric Proofs, logic, inductive and deductive reasoning will be heavily stressed (semester 1), as well as developing and using formulas for geometric shapes. (semester 2) Topics include theorems about lines and angles, triangle results, including congruence and similarity, Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometry, Polygons, Circles, Solids and transformations. 2. Course Outline: 1st semester: chapters 1-6 in textbook, as well as several projects. 2nd semester: chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 7 in textbook, as well as several projects. California Standards for Geometry will be taught throughout the year. See website  for current state standards. 3. Textbook: GEOMETRY by McDougal Littell (blue book) Textbook must be covered, returned in good condition, and cared for while on loan to the student. BRING YOUR BOOK TO CLASS EVERY DAY!!! 4. Grading System: All assignments are expected to be done neatly, on time, and honestly. a. Overall grade is calculated as a weighted average, described below. Homework 10% - must be done completely, with work shown, and turned in on time. Late homework (1 day) will be accepted at half-credit. HOMEWORK IS ASSIGNED FREQUENTLY! Participation 10% - notes, supplies, cooperation, class participation, projects, classwork. Quizzes 30% - Twice a week, usually. Often announced, sometimes unannounced (pop quiz) Tests 50% - All tests will be announced. Passing grade for tests, quizzes and the class is 60%. *************************************************************************** * To be eligible to take the chapter tests, a student must have all homework turned in * * before the test day. Any student who chooses to avoid his/her homework will be * * expected to complete their homework during the test, and MAKE UP THE TEST DURING * * BARK PERIOD. * *************************************************************************** b. Calculation of overall grade 95% - 100% = A+ 75% - 79% = C+ 90% - 94% = A 70% - 74% = C 85% - 90% = B+ 65% - 69% = D+ - avoid this!! 80% - 84 % = B 60% - 64% = D - avoid this!! Below 60% is failing, and will receive an F c. Make-up work for EXCUSED absences - must be done within a \"reasonable\" amount of time - Typically, one day of make-up time for each day of absence. It is the student's responsibility to get any missed notes from a classmate. Missed exams or quizzes must be made up within one week. The student is expected to pursue and complete all missing assignments. Those not made up within the stated time frame will receive a score of Zero. d. ZANGLE and Student Connect. I post grades regularly on Zangle – usually within a week. e. Cheating Policy (VUSD) A student who attempts to or gains an unfair advantage over any other student because of unacceptable behavior is subject to the following: Level One - zero on the assignment or test, conference with the student, contact the parent and send copy of form B to both parent and the Assistant Principal Level Two - zero on the assignment, 2 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Three - zero on the assignment, 5 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Four – Student shall be transferred from the high school and placed in alternative placement 5. Rules and Expectations. My rules are fairly simple – RESPECT for all - This means treat others how you wish to be treated. Use appropriate language and tone. Respect property – DO YOUR BEST. What you get from this class depends largely on what you put into it! – SEEK RESOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS - don't ignore them, they could get worse. – FOLLOW CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS Students will be expected to · Be in their seatwhen the tardy bell rings, with BOOK, supplies, ready to begin · Participate in all class work. Stay focused. · Pay attention, take notes during instruction, and ask questions · Keep all electronic distractions in their backpacks. CD players, video games and cell phones will be turned over to their administrator if used during class · Stay in assigned seat until dismissed. -TARDY It is important to be on time and prepared for class when the bell rings. I keep track of tardy arrivals; you will be expected to serve a class detention for your tardies. 6. Consequences Failure to meet the above rules and expectations will result in disciplinary action, according to school policy. (Verbal reminder, conference, removal of privilege, phone call to Parents, counseling referral, administrative referral.) 7.

Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\" . . .

Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.\n\nMost texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data.\nAlthough the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.\n\nThe first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.\n\nDeveloped from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.\n\nAlthough the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation.\nA First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented.\nDeveloped from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.\n\nThe field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.\n\nR is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields.\nDoing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive.\nA Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.\n\nBecause of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code.\nThe book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.\n\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.", "function_call_score": 16.154477188111315, "segments_extracted": 10, "original_length": 15847, "filtered_length": 14890, "compression_ratio": 0.9396100208241307}

{"text": "Just because something doesn't teach everything about a subject doesn't make it a poor instructional aid. Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it. Even if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all. (Though if you end up struggling with the harder topics because you didn't have the rules of algebra appropriately memorized, you might never want to study more of it...)\n\nI disagree. I think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with. After all, his goal is to balance an equation, and look, he just balanced it... so what else is there to know ? Thus, the memorization approach creates the impression that math (or whatever subject you're studying) is all about arbitrary rules that make no sense; it's all about \"guessing the teacher's password\", and that's boring.\n\nContrast this with the approach of treating an equation like a puzzle. If \"2x - 3 = 5\", and we want to know what x is, there are many ways to approach the solution. We could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc. Some possible partial answers are, \"someone took away 3, so let's add it back\", or \"if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution\". But \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer. High scores don't mean anything, algebra does.\n\nOf course, this is complicated by the fact that during the process of trying to memorize the rules, I often stop to think about why they work in an attempt to rederive them and make sure I'm not misremembering them. So it's not pure rote memorization, like the way it seems to be with DragonBox. But I would still expect that if somebody first learned them as meaningless rules in the game, and was then later taught math and the reasons for the rules, they'd have a good chance of being delighted at discovering where the rules came from, and could spend all of their cognitive capacity on developing an actual understanding.\n\nFair enough; it's possible that you and I simply think in different ways. I personally find it very difficult to memorize (seemingly) arbitrary rules, and I found it very difficult to un-teach the \"guess the teacher's password\" mentality to people. But it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.\n\nWe could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc.\n\nBut \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer.", "function_call_score": 24.972253052164262, "segments_extracted": 7, "original_length": 3604, "filtered_length": 3344, "compression_ratio": 0.9278579356270811}

{"text": "Description: This course studies fundamental algebraic systems in mathematics, selected from groups, rings, fields, and modules. Examples of groups include the invertible matrices with a fixed size and the roots of unity. Rings are illustrated by integers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.) Finally, ordinary vectors in space and any lattice in the plane are examples of modules. The concern with these algebraic systems is not simply the study of individual systems, but also of functions between systems which carry one operation into the other. For instance, the determinant not only converts matrices into numbers, but it sends a product of matrices into a product of numbers. The level of attention given to such operation-preserving transformations (putting them on an equal footing with the algebraic systems they transform) is one of the characteristic features of abstract algebra, and also one of the algebraic ideas which have reached into other areas of mathematics.

There will never be enough time for us to go through every listed problem in class, and it is probably unrealistic to think that you will be able to find the time to work through every listed problem, but you should at least spend some time thinking about virtually every problem, and working the more interesting or challenging to completion. The daily homework assignments will not generally be collected or graded.

The important thing is that you at least look at all the assigned problems.

This portfolio will be collected twice during the semester, once upon our return from our spring break, on Monday 17 March, and again at the end of the course, on Friday 2 May. Each of these portfolios should be a representative collection of your work during that half of the semester; each collection you turn in should include 5 problems, written up in a finished form, along with a brief discussion of why you chose to include that particular problem. These problems should represent work you are proud of, or problems which brought you to a breakthrough point. Each of these portfolios of your work will be worth 40 points, 8 points per problem. Presumably you will hand in 5 sheets of paper, each of which will include a nicely organized solution to the problem, which might be from homework, or from a lab or worksheet, of from an exam, along with that reflection mentioned above.\n\nGrading: I use a rather traditional Grading Scale: A = 90% (or better), AB = 87%, B = 80%, BC = 77%, C = 70%, CD = 67%, D = 60%.

{"text": "Some people will be surprised that our Mathematical Literacy course includes some factoring. Over the years, the topic of factoring has been a focal point of conversations — almost with the assumption that a reform math course would not cover any factoring. Sometimes, we go to the extreme view of \"anything not practical right now … will be omitted\", and factoring is usually not very practical.\n\nIn our Mathematical Literacy course we covered factoring last week — true, this is just the GCF (no trinomial methods nor special formulas). Since we only include GCF as a method students have an easier time. However, if we had time, I would not mind if we covered a little more factoring.\n\nFor language skills, it is important that people be able to express thoughts concisely (simplify); in some important situations, it is even more important to be able to express thoughts in a more complex way that maintains the equivalent message — persuasive writing and speaking are particular modes in this style. In a general way, learning (or a process) that can only be used one direction is usually learned only partially. Deeper learning depends upon a variety of experiences with objects or ideas.\n\nOf course, one risk of this work with the GCF is that students get even more confused. We need to be careful that assessments help students understand better; within the Math Lit class, I need more experience designing the class work so better assessments can be delivered to students.\n\nThe AMATYC conference (Anaheim, October 31 to November 3) will include several sessions on New Life-inspired efforts to reform developmental mathematics. I will be doing a general session on the New Life model at the conference, and other sessions will focus on particular implementations. Over the next month or so, I will be posting a detailed schedule.\n\nThis conference will not include a workshop on the New Life courses; this workshop was done at last year's conference and the materials are still available at  If you want to know more about the details of MLCS (Mathematical Literacy for College Students) and AL (Algebraic Literacy), I plan to create some additional 5-minute presentations about each — they will be posted on the \"Instant Presentations\" page (\n\nSome related work will also be available at the conference — the Dana Center \"New Mathways Project\" will have sessions. When the mini-program is available, I will post a summary of all reform-related sessions.\n\nA course design can facilitate learning, and a course design can hinder learning. I suspect that we get so focused on the details of our math courses that we may not notice whether our course is facilitating or hindering.\n\nIn our Math Literacy class, we have been working on algebraic reasoning. On the surface, the class looks like we are not 'covering' very much because we don't include some typical algebraic (developmental) topics. We found some hidden treasure this week in class.\n\nAs we often do, part of class is based on groups figuring out problems with some guidance and reflection. Today this meant that we had each group do an equation 'tag-team' style — each student could either do the next step, or erase the last step. Students had a little trouble playing by the rules, and wanted to switch to 'their' method to solve the equation. The payoff came when we talked about the different choices, as more students figured out that they have options for linear equations.\n\nThe hidden treasure came next, not that students saw it as totally good. We looked at how we could solve equations of a type never seen before, starting with a simple rational equation (namely, 5 = 200/x). Students could see the solution (40) though not always obtained formally, so we talked about doing 'opposite' operations to solve. We followed this with a radical equation (the pendulum model), which is not normally seen in this level of math course. To solve for the length inside the radical, we listed the calculation steps if we knew the length and wanted to calculate the period. Then, we reversed — the opposite operations in the reverse order.\n\nTo me, the hidden treasure in this is that students get to think about both types of skills that we use in mathematics — we have routine procedures (often based on properties) and we have reasoning about statements (often based on relationships unique to the problem). Wouldn't it be wonderful if students developed both strategies, instead of just using routine procedures (often memorized)?\n\nOf course, one risk of this work with the GCF is that students get even more confused.\n\nWhen the mini-program is available, I will post a summary of all reform-related sessions.\n\nI suspect that we get so focused on the details of our math courses that we may not notice whether our course is facilitating or hindering.\n\nTo me, the hidden treasure in this is that students get to think about both types of skills that we use in mathematics — we have routine procedures (often based on properties) and we have reasoning about statements (often based on relationships unique to the problem).", "function_call_score": 20.54997043169722, "segments_extracted": 16, "original_length": 6764, "filtered_length": 5059, "compression_ratio": 0.7479302188054405}

{"text": "In grades 9-12, the\nmathematics curriculum should include the informal exploration of\ncalculus concepts from both a graphical and a numerical perspective\nso that all students can--\n\nanalyze the graphs\nof polynomial, rational, radical, and transcendental functions.\n\nThis standard does not\nadvocate the formal study of calculus in high school for\nall students or even for college-intending students. Rather, it\ncalls for opportunities for students to systematically, but informally,\ninvestigate the central ideas of calculus--limit, the area under\na curve, the rate of change, and the slope of a tangent line--that\ncontribute to a deepening of their understanding of function and\nits utility in representing and answering questions about real-world\nphenomena.\n\nMost of the mathematics\ndescribed in the other 9-12 standards involve finite processes,\nsuch as determining a sequence of transformations that maps a figure\nonto a congruent figure or approximating a zero of a polynominal\nfunction using an iterative technique. In contrast, the concept\nof limit and its connection with the other mathematical topics in\nthis standard is based on infinite processes. Thus, explorations\nof the topics proposed here not only extend students' knowledge\nof function characteristics but also introduce them to another mode\nof mathematical thinking.\n\nInstruction should be highly\nexploratory and based on numerical and geometric experiences that\ncapitalize on both calculator and computer technology. Instructional\nactivities should be aimed at providing students with firm conceptual\nunderpinnings of calculus rather than at developing manipulative\ntechniques.\n\nThe development of the\ncalculus represents one of the great intellectual accomplishments\nin human history; perhaps the greatest achievement in the application\nof mathematics is the use of calculus in physics during the first\nthird of this century. Today, methods of calculus are applied increasingly\nin the social and biological sciences, and in business as well.\nAs students explore the topics proposed in this standard, it is\nimportant that they develop an awareness of, and appreciation for,\nthe historical origins and the cultural contributions of the calculus.\n\nAt a somewhat higher but\nstill intuitive level, the series can be summed by investigating\nthe limit of the sequence of partial sums (either by using a calculator\nor a simple looping computer program or by applying the formula\nfor the sum of a finite geometric series). An understanding of the\nconcept of limit in contexts such as this should in turn contribute\nto the meaningful development of the remaining topics in this standard.\n\nSimilarly, it is important\nthat all students recognize how the concept of the area under a\ncurve builds on and extends their previous experiences with areas\nof geometric figures. College-intending students also should recognize\nhow the rate of change builds on and extends their experiences with\nuniform motion and associated rates in algebra and trigonometry,\nand how the slope of a tangent to a curve generalizes the notion\nof the slope of a line as developed in algebra.\n\nComputing technology makes\nthe fundamental concepts and applications of calculus accessible\nto all students. The area under a finite portion of a curve, for\nexample, can be approximated geometrically by partitioning the region\ninto rectangles with bases of equal length and heights given by\nfunction values at an endpoint of each base. Using a calculator\nor a computer-based algorithm, students can easily sum the areas\nto obtain a numerical approximation of the desired area. This approximation\ncan then be sharpened by using sequences of rectangles whose bases\nare made to decrease toward zero. Project work might require students\nto investigate other ways of partitioning the region so as to obtain\na more precise estimate. (A description of a process using trapezoids\ncan be found in the standard on mathematical\nconnections.)\n\nUsing interactive graphing\nutilities, college-intending students could examine other characteristics\nof the graphs of functions, including continuity, asymptotes, end\nbehavior (i.e., behavior as |x| ), and concavity. Moreover,\nsuch analysis can be applied with equal ease to the graphs of a\nvariety of complicated functions and to curves specified by polar\nand parametric equations.\n\nComputing technology also\npermits the foreshadowing of analytic ideas for college-intending\nstudents. From a computer-graphics perspective, for example, a differentiable\nfunction can be viewed as a function having the property that a\nsmall portion of its graph, when highly magnified, approximates\na line segment. The \"zoom in\" feature permits students\nto magnify the graph of a function over a small interval to view\nthe approximate segment representation and to compute the gradient\n(slope). Using the computer to plot successive gradients for a series\nof short intervals (see fig. 13.4) suggests\na process that derives functions from functions.\n\nFig. 13.4.Using computer graphics to see that the derivative of y\n= sin x is y = cos x\n\nAlthough developing a foundation\nfor the future study of calculus remains a goal of the 9-12 curriculum\nfor college-intending students, equally important is the development\nof prerequisite understandings for further study of statistics,\nprobability, and discrete mathematics. This standard calls for a\nnew balance of skills, concepts, and applications in that portion\nof the curriculum traditionally associated with preparation for\ncalculus. Instead of devoting large blocks of time to developing\na mastery of paper-and-pencil manipulative skills, more time and\neffort should be spent on developing a conceptual understanding\nof key ideas and their applications.

{"text": "Lie groups play such a central role in mathematics and its applications that all mathematics students should be aware of them. From computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere. Nevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared. Harriet Pollatsek's Lie Groups is her entry in this list.\n\nHowe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.\n\nLie Groups is fundamentally a problem book: each chapter presents a sequence of problems that students should solve. In each chapter, the main sections are followed by a summary section called \"Putting the pieces together.\" Finally, a section called \"A broader view\" tries to give a wider context to the material in that chapter. Everything important is done through problems. Thus, this is a book to be used, not a book to be read.\n\nSome choices I just don't understand. Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere? (My students were fascinated.) Why work only with the one-dimensional Lorenz group? Why not have more pictures? After all, it's easy to draw pictures of the one-dimensional Lie groups.\n\nThere is no representation theory at all. The adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context. With no representation theory, one cannot do much more than say \"the physicists use this a lot,\" without showing how or why. That seems like a pity.\n\nPollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book. Using it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing. If that applies to you, give this book a try.\n\nFernando Q. Gouvêa is Carter Professor of Mathematics at Colby College. He'll be doing the Lie groups thing again soon.\n\nThe adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context.", "function_call_score": 19.145541570643502, "segments_extracted": 9, "original_length": 5641, "filtered_length": 3579, "compression_ratio": 0.6344619748271583}

Using graphics and humor to lighten what is often perceived as a challenging discipline, Larry Gonick teaches all of the essentials, from functions and limits to derivatives and integrals.\n\nThe cartoon's unnamed narrator, with the help of his friend Delta Wye, guides us through a vast range of concepts. We see, for example, how calculus was initially conceived by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz as a way of resolving age-old mysteries involving the calculation of motion. Newton and Leibniz make several cameo appearances within the book, sometimes to quibble with each other regarding who invented calculus first, but mostly to explain a new concept to us. It's fun to learn about instantaneous velocity with an example involving Newton jumping up and down on a trampoline.\n\nWe go on to study a vast range of functions—Gonick invents a function creature to show how they work. We also are treated to a visual definition of the limit that is significantly easier to understand than the algebraic version that has traditionally been taught to generations of students. Learning derivatives in calculus has always involved diagrams, but not quite as vividly as in this book.

Most important is access to a computer with a reliable internet connection, and the ability to operate that computer and a web browser. If you are reading this, you're probably OK for this part. There will be a couple assignments that ask you to upload files, cut-and-paste internet addresses (URLs), etc. In most cases, a non-technical alternative is available if needed.\n\nMath 1080 is a terminal math course, meaning it does not prepare you for any other math class.

There will be fixed due-dates for those assignments. However, the course is asynchronous, which means that you can log in any time during the week that is convenient for you and complete the assignments.\n\nDuring class there will be frequent assignment, these can range from quizzes to group work. These assignments cannot be made up and make up a significant portion of your grade.\n\nOutside of class a discussion forum will be provided where you can ask questions about the reading, and discuss the material with me and your classmates.In class you can ask me and we can discuss any problems you are having. Usually if you are having trouble, others are as well.\n\nThere will be a set of homework exercises assigned each week. The online homework exercises are required, and graded. However, if you miss a question, it will show the answer, allowing you to self-diagnose your mistake, and then you can try similar problems until you get the questions correct. You can ask questions in the discussion board about any homework questions you have difficulty with.\n\nAdditionally, each week there will be an assignment not from the book. This assignment will be a more open-ended question that usually requires a bit more work, conceptual understanding, possibly some outside research, and may require a written solution or explanation. In some cases these may be collaborative assignments with intermediary due dates in the middle of the week.

The idea is to have the class operate like a study group - with all of you working together to further your learning. This is what distinguishes an online class from a traditional distance learning or math lab course.\n\nUse the Discussion Board to ask for help on problems you don't understand how to do. If you do understand how to do the problems, help out your classmates by answering questions on the discussion board.\n\nI will monitor the homework discussion boards, and will respond to questions if they go unanswered, or if someone provides an incorrect response. If you have additional questions, didn't understand the answer someone gave you, or have a question that has gone unanswered, don't hesitate to email me and ask questions. However, please use the discussion boards first, so that others can benefit from your questions.\n\nAdditionally, you can get help from the drop-in tutors at the Academic Support Center on either campus. Be aware that not all tutors have taken this math course, and may have difficulty helping you. Writing tutors are also available to help with writing assignments.\n\nIf you have questions about the homework or readings, you can ask them in class. Feel free to email me, call me, or visit me in my office for additional help.\n\nWhen you post a message or email me, please understand that I am not online all the time. Please allow at least 24 hours for me to respond to your questions, possibly longer on the weekends (up to 48 hours).\n\nThe first week of class there is a bio assignment and syllabus quiz.\n\nIn class assignments will count 20% of your course grade.\n\nYour weighted percent in the class will be converted to a decimal grade via this scale:\n\nOnline courses have the same academic integrity as any other college course. You can trust that I will respond to your questions and comments in a timely manner, as well as be timely and fair in grading submitted assignments.\n\nAs your instructor, I trust that you will make your best effort to complete the activities in a timely manner and to the best of your abilities. If there is an unforeseen change in your schedule feel free to contact me for alternative arrangements. I expect that the work you submit for this course will be your own work. Cheating and/or plagiarism will not be tolerated. Please refer to the college's Academic Dishonesty policy for more details.\n\nThere are ways to express emotions without words. These are called emoticons. You've probably seen several already in computer writing: ;-) :) :o) :-( etc., These are actually faces turned on their side to represent emotions. They take the place of body language and facial expressions that are a natural part of communication. In this setting, it's difficult sometimes to discern between sarcasm and criticism. Using emoticons can often convey the context of the comment when words can't.\n\nMost importantly, this class will be free of sexual, verbal, and racial discrimination or harassment.\n\nHowever, if you miss a question, it will show the answer, allowing you to self-diagnose your mistake, and then you can try similar problems until you get the questions correct.\n\nGetting Help\n\nThe discussion board is a forum where you can ask questions about the reading or homework, and get help from me or your classmates.\n\nAdditionally, you can get help from the drop-in tutors at the Academic Support Center on either campus.\n\nWhen you post a message or email me, please understand that I am not online all the time.", "function_call_score": 18.607084142878495, "segments_extracted": 31, "original_length": 13382, "filtered_length": 7075, "compression_ratio": 0.5286952622926319}
{"text": "Launched in May, 2000, with the support of an NSF grant, Project WELCOME is a new part of the\nSUMMA Program. WELCOME\nbrings together elements of three MAA program themes: academic technology, professional development, and promoting involvement of historically underrepresented groups. The general goals include:\n\nDeveloping at minority serving institutions a community of teachers who create and use interactive, computer based, explorations of mathematics\n\nThe interactive explorations are integrated environments which combine graphical, dynamical, symbolic, textual, and numerical representations of mathematical ideas and relations. Users interact with these environments in the familiar point and click idiom of internet web pages. The goal of each activity is to encourage students to experiment with some mathematical context by manipulating aspects of the environment and observing the results. The interactions are intended to be so natural that the environments take on a kind of virtual realism that brings mathematical constructs to life. This can take the form of moving and deforming geometric objects (in the style of Geometer's Sketchpad), but can also involve interacting with symbolic, logical, and numerical aspects of an environment.\n\nA past MAA effort, the Interactive Mathematical Text Project (IMTP), demonstrated that empowering teachers to create these activities is both feasible and desirable. In particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations. A showcase of these activities is freely available at the Mathwright website. Visitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.1), necessary for using the activities.\n\nOne of the goals of Project WELCOME is to produce series of interactive explorations that are directly tied to specific courses. The materials that are produced by the project will be distributed at a WELCOME Library on the internet, starting in the summer or fall of 2001.\n\nThe MAA has an ongoing interest in increasing the participation in mathematics of historically underrepresented groups. Project WELCOME is founded on the belief that technology can make a contribution in this area. The Project Directors believe that interactive mathematical explorations are a particularly attractive and powerful lure to the investigation of mathematical ideas. It is hoped that this lure will help attract students who might otherwise not elect to study mathematics.\n\nProject WELCOME has many features in common with MAA professional development programs. The faculty developers will each be teamed with an experienced Mathwright user who will serve as a mentor and collaborator. The goals of the project go beyond training new Mathwright developers.

{"text": "Two weeks ago in my Algebra 2 Trig Honors class we were finishing up our unit on rational expressions, equations, and functions. In past years, students at this level had focused on graphing only simple rational functions – transformations of y=1/x. (In Precalculus, students are exposed to general rational functions.) I was feeling frustrated, though, at how limited this approach felt – I didn't want students to be misled into ignoring the big vast ocean full of rational functions after looking at a goldfish bowl-sized sample. (Questions like: \"so it will always look like this?\" were driving me crazy.) But at the same time, I didn't want to bog them down with a tedious approach to graphing general cases by hand. I just wanted my students to get a feel for all of the different crazy shapes these graphs can make, notice patterns, and begin the process of generalizing.\n\nLast year I had included an investigation of general rational functions using Wolfram Alpha on a homework assignment. In hindsight, leaving this activity for homework wasn't a good call – there wasn't enough time for thoughtful follow-up, and by having students work alone they missed out on the magic of discussing their findings with others and building understanding together. So this year, I took an extra class day to allow students time to play around with more complicated rational functions on the Desmos calculator. (Which I am a little bit in love with.)\n\nIn my 2nd period class, I didn't do a great job of setting up and explaining what I had envisioned for the hour. I showed them the Desmos calculator, told them they should be graphing a variety of rational functions, and gave them a sheet with 4 specific examples with bullet points for guided questions underneath to use as a framework for their investigation. On the back board, I had written \"What do you notice/what are you wondering about…\" with different categories for them to record some of their findings throughout the hour. The idea was that throughout class, I would circulate and peek in on their conversations, help answer some questions or poke at their thinking a bit, they would record their observations and questions on the back board, and at the end of class we'd save 10 minutes to discuss our findings on the board.\n\nAs I turned students loose to begin working, some problems became evident pretty quickly. While students were comfortable recognizing the one vertical and one horizontal asymptote for simple rational functions, they couldn't \"see\" the asymptotes for the more complicated graphs. This to me indicated that they didn't have a good enough understanding of what an asymptote truly was, but instead had mastered an algorithm for graphing the simple rational functions. I tried to chat with groups of students to see where the disconnect was, and I encouraged students to graph the lines that they visually predicted were asymptotes – then connect that to the algebra of each function. I also realized I had not done a good job explaining or modeling the way they should record what they noticed/wondered on the back board – I ended up with lots of random pictures and little interpretation or generalizations. I also did a horrible job keeping track of the timing of the class. It became clear we weren't going to have the 10 minutes I wanted at the end of class to pull together our big findings – instead, I had to take pictures of the back board and wait until the next day to summarize their investigation.\n\nThere were more nuanced conversations than the sloppy work on the board indicated, but overall I wasn't happy with the way things had gone. I didn't feel like we had arrived at enough clarity or closure for the big ideas I wanted them to be tackling.\n\nLucky for me, I learned a bit from my mistakes and in my 4th period class I did a MUCH better job of setting up the activity. I graphed the first specific example on Desmos, talked through how I could visually \"see\" the 2 vertical asymptotes and 1 horizontal asymptote, showed them to graph those lines to confirm the asymptotic behavior, returned to the algebra of the example function to make connections between the algebra and the graph, then added a generalization to the board of noticing/wondering.\n\nDuring this hour, the students did a better job of working together, asked me fewer questions, and were more able to generalize their findings. They even surprised me with some observations I was *not* expecting them to make (see the last one under \"V.A.\") and a few students figured out how to use sliders with Desmos to more efficiently explore how changing different bits of the function they graphed would impact its shape. You can tell by looking at their noticings/wonderings how much more successful my second shot at this lesson was. During the follow-up conversation at the end of class, I addressed all of the points on the board, asked for students to help respond to some of the questions, and felt that the majority of students left with a better understanding of both the important features of these graphs and how the algebra of the functions controls their shape.\n\nSince I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit. General rational functions were not tested (only transformations of y=1/x), but I did decide to include a question that had students explain the shape of the parent function y=1/x. It was a great way for me to see if all of the investigation and conversation about the shapes of the graphs had paid off… were my students more \"mathematically fluent\" in the vocabulary and ideas associated with rational functions? I did have some very strong responses, and I've included my favorite below.\n\nI'm sure there are ways for me to tweak and improve upon this lesson for future classes, but I was happy with the chance it afforded students to talk, play, investigate, and generalize.\n\nSome comments and questions here\n* Love the guided questions along the way. Do you intend to move away from the more specific clues? Is the unit long enough for that?\n* Love the writing on the second set of board snapshots. Why is it that students are so determined to misspell the word vertical even when it is in the question that they are answering?\n* In addition to division for slant asymptotes, do you suggest division as a way to get at horizontal asymptotes as well?\n* How comfortable are your kids with 'washing away the remainder' in these processes?\n* I am intrigued by DESMOS – haven't used it. I'm partial to GeoGebra myself.\n\nI like how you have students put their observations on the board – I'm not sure my algebra students are persistent enough in their investigations, but I would like to try something similar to this in Geometry. Have you ever done it with a class that is not honors?\n\nNo, that was actually my first time to have students record observations on the board like this. You can see how much better I modeled for students the types of things they should be recording in the 2nd class. I think I would be comfortable doing something like this in a non-honors class, but the investigation activity would have to be much more structured – I was asking a lot, conceptually, of my students here.\n\nI just wanted my students to get a feel for all of the different crazy shapes these graphs can make, notice patterns, and begin the process of generalizing.\n\nSince I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit.\n\nWhy is it that students are so determined to misspell the word vertical even when it is in the question that they are answering?\n* In addition to division for slant asymptotes, do you suggest division as a way to get at horizontal asymptotes as well?\n* How comfortable are your kids with 'washing away the remainder' in these processes?\n* I am intrigued by DESMOS – haven't used it.\n\nI like how you have students put their observations on the board – I'm not sure my algebra students are persistent enough in their investigations, but I would like to try something similar to this in Geometry.", "function_call_score": 16.682619991795434, "segments_extracted": 16, "original_length": 7313, "filtered_length": 8088, "compression_ratio": 1.1059756597839463}

This course will provide you with the opportunity to apply calculus to the physical principles underlying the laws of nature. Major emphasis is on problem solving with laboratory work and class demonstrations to provide data for developing analytical models that can be understood and manipulated mathematically.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, linear algebra/matrix theory is an absolute requirement. Linear Algebra is the mathematical study of vectors and vector spaces (also called linear spaces). Matrices are widely used to represent the linear transformations that input one vector and output another. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Calculus. The only REAL prerequisite for this material is a good knowledge of high school algebra. We have designated AB Calculus as a requirement because everyone will need strong algebra skills and good analytical ability. Linear Algebra has many practical applications, not limited to math/physics/engineering. It shows up in economics, logistics, finance, computer science, operations research, and lots of other disciplines.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, advanced calculus is an absolute requirement. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Advanced Placement Calculus AB & BC. The material in these courses however, has generally been limited to one independent variable expressed in the form of y = f(x). Multivariable/vector calculus is used to describe phenomena that result from the simultaneous effects of many variables. For example, in the case of the ideal gas law from chemistry, the pressure of an ideal gas is a result of the number of moles of the gas, the volume of the container, and the temperature. We could express this as P = f(n,V,T). If all three are changed simultaneously, how is the pressure changed?\n\nPre-AP PreCalculus provides opportunities to study real numbers, functions and their graphs, trigonometric relationships, parametric representations, sequences, and series. This course provides the necessary foundation for advanced placement or college calculus. Extends and builds on the foundation for the Advanced Placement program.

{"text": "BEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.\n\nMark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995.

Depending on the specific constraints, the resulting schedule contains about 200-250 scheduled courses during the planning period of one quarter.\n\nOptimize utilization of beds in a hospital depending on total number of beds, allocations to certain departments, expected duration of the individual stays in the hospital, required safety quantities, etc. The benefits of optimization include maximized utilization of available beds, minimized waiting time, minimized bottlenecks, and increased visibility into the hospital supply chain.\n\nApart from optimizing schedules there is an endless list of other applications where using applied mathematics and in particular optimization, greatly improves profitability. Beyond more common areas like route planning, location determination in a logistics network, and commission structures in a multi-level marketing environment, here are examples of successful projects we have done:\n\nWeb-based optimal chemical formulation and blending: Upon entering a set of desired chemical and physical properties of the end product on a web page the application computes the optimal chemical formulation in terms of meeting the specifications while minimizing cost and returns the result in the user's web browser.

{"text": "Because of its large command structure and intricate syntax, Mathematica can be difficult to learn. Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\" . . . [a] treasure house of material for students and teachers alike . . . can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic.\" --London Times Higher Education Supplement \"The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking.\" --SIAM Review \"Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards . . . to novelty . . . each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically.\" --Mathematical Reviews A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling provides in-depth and systematic coverage of the art and science of mathematical modelling. Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.\n\nMost texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data.\nAlthough the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.\n\nThe first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.\n\nDeveloped from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.\n\nAlthough the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation.\nA First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented.\nDeveloped from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.\n\nThe field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.\n\nR is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields.\nDoing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive.\nA Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.\n\nBecause of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code.\nThe book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.\n\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.", "function_call_score": 16.154477188111315, "segments_extracted": 10, "original_length": 15847, "filtered_length": 14890, "compression_ratio": 0.9396100208241307}

The author has designed the Book so that whether you have a maths A level, GCSE, or perhaps feel that you need to go back over the very basics, Knowledge is built up in small steps, not big jumps. Once you are confident that you have firmly grasped the foundations, this book will help you to make the progression beyond the Mechanical exercises and into the development of a maths tool-kit for the analysis of economic and Business problems. This is a skill which will prove valuable for your degree and for your future employers.\n\n* The flexible design of the contents means that this book is suitable if your starting point is maths A level, GCSE, or even if you have forgotten most of the maths you learned in school.\n* A gradual learning gradient underpins the text; each concept is explored comprehensively, including numerous examples and exercises at each stage to ensure that you get a really good understanding of it.\n* Builds self-confidence in maths through the use of step-by-step examples, progress exercises, hints and rules, encouraging you to develop a 'maths tool-kit' for analysing economics and business problems.\n* Any unnecessarily long explanations have been rewritten to make the exposition clearer in the appropriate places.\n* Material on matrix algebra, limits, and necessary and sufficient functions has been revised in line with market feedback\n* Answers to the progress exercises now appear at the end of the book, rather than online, for ease of use.\n\nThe Title \"Maths for Economics \" is written by Geoff Renshaw. This book was published in the year 2011. The ISBN number 0199602123|9780199602124 is assigned to the Paperback version of this title. This book has total of pp. 712 (Pages). The publisher of this title is Oxford University Press. We have about 84121 other great books from this publisher.

{"text": "This model features a classic sequence of courses that emphasizes connections across\ncontent strands. Data analysis topics have been added to the familiar high school\nmathematics curriculum. Topics\nare grouped so that Year 1 focuses on algebra and algebraic reasoning, Year 2 focuses\non geometry, and Year 3 returns to a focus on further algebraic topics leading to\ntrigonometry and pre-calculus. This sequence works well for many students, is familiar\nto teachers and parents, and fits the design of many instructional materials. However,\nthis does not mean that the status quo is working for all students. Even though\ncourse topics and sequencing may look familiar, effective strategies for presenting\nthe material must be implemented to make this or any model curriculum successful.\nStudents must be placed in a course for which they have the prerequisites and have\nadequate time and support to fully understand the material. Students must be engaged\nwith rich problems throughout each course in order to understand the mathematics\nfully and develop creative problem solving and reasoning skills. Students must also\nbe expected to communicate mathematical ideas using formal mathematical language.\nTeachers in schools adopting Model C will benefit from professional development\nthat includes strategies for successfully teaching all students and that familiarizes\nteachers with sources of problems to deepen student understanding of mathematical\ntopics.\n\nModel C' is an adaptation of Model C that allows additional time for students who are preparing for postsecondary education in programs that do not include calculus. This adaptation prepares students for OGT requirements by the end of the second year course and meets the Ohio Board of Regents expectations for students to be prepared for a non-remedial college mathematics course by the end of the third year course.\n\nAll students require a rigorous and demanding curriculum in order to develop sound reasoning and strong problem solving skills. The topics covered in Year 1 of this model can provide this rigor. Students progress from their informal middle school experience with number relationships, data analysis, and linear equations to more formal definitions, algebraic reasoning, and graphical representations. With this model, as with any model, different students may require different amounts of time and support to become proficient with the mathematics.\n\nThe focus of this course is the development of algebraic understanding, reasoning, and skills using mathematical language to express abstract ideas. The Year 1 course has four main themes:\n\nMore specifically, students will solve linear equations and inequalities and systems\nof equations. They will graph a variety of functions and add the study of probability and statistics to the topics covered in a typical Algebra I course. Appropriate use of technology is encouraged to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nThe second year model develops formal logic and reasoning skills through the study of Euclidean geometry. Although geometry is a subject of importance and practical use, the main goal of the course is to develop students' abilities to reason and to present coherent arguments. In addition to this deep involvement with logic and deduction, students discover connections between formal geometry and the algebraic techniques learned earlier, and they learn important practical applications of geometry. With mastery of the Year 1 and Year 2 courses, students will be prepared for further mathematical education and for understanding deeper connections between abstract mathematics and real world situations.\n\nThe course begins with polynomial and exponetial functions, with emphasis on quadratics.\nThe focus of the course is the development of logic and reasoning, along with basic ways to think geometrically. The two foci for the Year 2 course are formal reasoning and applications of geometry (constructions, calculating lengths, areas, and volumes). Geometric constructions should be woven through the course. Appropriate use of technology is encouraged to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nPrerequisite to this course is working knowledge of key topics from years one and two, including number line and interval notation, solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities, and absolute value and distance. The thrust of the Year 3 course is to reinforce and extend the algebraic topics from Year 1 and Year 2 courses.\nThroughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics. Students should use graphing calculators and other technology as integral parts of the course to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nWith the advent of the core requirements for Ohio, all students must take mathematics inThis course presents a mix of algebraic and geometric topics that will help develop students' algebraic thinking. Throughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics. Mastery of the four courses in this model will provide students with the mathematical and reasoning skills needed to succeed in a rigorous college-level calculus course.\n\nThe Year 4 course has several focus areas: (1) formal proofs by induction with applications, (2) modeling bivariate data, and (3) trigonometry. By studying these topics, the student will have completed a comprehensive high school curriculum. Students may use graphing calculators and other technology to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nOne purpose of secondary education in the United States has always been preparing\nstudents for their roles as citizens, as well as preparing them for future study\nand the workplace. Today numbers and data are critical parts of public and private\ndecision making. Decisions about health care, finances, science policy, and the\nenvironment are decisions that require citizens to understand information presented\nin numerical form, in tables, diagrams, and graphs. Students must develop skills\nto analyze complex issues using quantitative tools.\n\nThis course also introduces functions of two variables and graphs in three dimensions.\nThe applications in all sections should provide an opportunity for deeper understanding\nand extension of the material from earlier courses.

{"text": "When studying for math, we often use exercises, worksheets and sample problems to work through in order to prepare for an upcoming test, exam or review. However, as in most other subjects, note taking and journaling is also very effective and very important to help with the understanding of specific math concepts. Whether you dictate your notes and have them available for audio, or write your notes to review them visually, the strategies and tips here will help you better prepare for math tests and exams. Effective notes will help you to remember important concepts taught in class and they will guide you through various math problems.\n\nI prefer to use the two column approach in my notes and I also prefer to use pencil. To use the two column approach, your actual notes will be on one side and the examples or theorems/forumulas will be on the other. There is usually more than one method of solving a problem, use your notes to document this. Be sure to include any examples that you believe will help you later. Math is often about making connections as so many concepts are interrelated, be sure to record the connections you make. Areas where you have concerns or believe to be your greatest weakness are also the areas you should emphasize. To emphasize, you may wish to use a highligher and attach a few stickies. Personally, I prefer to date my notes as well, sometimes I include the text pages for handy reference.\n\nI've already mentioned that it is helpful to keep audio notes, however, it is difficult to record examples of exercises in audio. Audio is better when you are reviewing postulates, procedures and formulas. The more you hear the explanations, the greater the chance you will retain the information. However, you may also wish to record your notes on your computer. I have used Microsoft One Note previously and found it quite effective. There is an add-in that allows you to perform calculations and to plot graphs and it contains an extensive collection of mathematical symbols and structures to display expressions and has a pretty good equation gallery. Two others I use are La-Tex, and Math Symbols. Although I like La Tex, it isn't my first choice for taking notes. Math Symbols is great for creating exercises and it allows you to create your equations quickly (newer version has handwriting recognition) but you'll still need another application to integrate it with. A lot of my students prefer One Note because it's where they keep all of their notes. However, everyone is different and you'll need a strategy that works best for you.\n\nListen carefully to your instructor and jot down the key points about solving problems, proving theorems or using a procedure. Write down everything you think that will help you when you return to this concept later.\n\nDon't get too wordy, keep your notes to the point and simple to understand.\n\nUse logical organization, jumping around from concept to concept will only be confusing. Make sure your examples have key points in your notes.\n\nRecord alternate methods, as I mentioned earlier, there is usually more than one way to solve a problem, be sure to record the alternative methods.\n\nIn summary, most important of all is to review your notes in a timely way. Make review part of your routine. We are all guilty of cramming before tests and exams but a little review along the way will better equip you to see greater success in math.

Most mathematicians I know aren't working on problems they would have expected when they arrived in grad school.

{"text": "Instructional\nprograms from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students\nto—\n\ncreate and use representations to organize, record, and communicate\nmathematical ideas;\n\nThe importance of representations can be seen in every section of this chapter.\nIf large or small numbers are expressed in scientific notation, their\nmagnitudes are easier to compare and they can more readily be used in\ncomputations. Representation is pervasive in algebra. Graphs convey particular\nkinds of information visually, whereas symbolic expressions may be easier\nto manipulate, analyze, and transform. Mathematical modeling requires\nrepresentations, as illustrated in the \"drug dosage\" problem and in the\n\"pipe offset\" problem. The use of matrices to represent transformations\nin the plane illustrates how geometric operations can be represented visually\nyet also be amenable to symbolic representation and manipulation in a\nway that helps students understand them. The various methods for representing\ndata sets further demonstrate the centrality of this topic.\n\nA wide variety of representations can be seen in the examples in this chapter.\nBy using various representations for the \"counting rectangles\" problem\nin the \"Problem Solving\" section, students could find different solutions\nand compare them. The use of algebraic symbolism to explain a striking\ngraphical phenomenon is central to the \"string traversing tiles\" task\nin the \"Communication\" section. Representations facilitate reasoning and\nare the tools of proof: they are used to examine statistical relationships\nand to establish the validity of a builder's shortcut. They are at the\ncore of communication and support the development of understanding in\nMarta's and Nancy's work on the \"string traversing tiles\" problem. Although\nat one level the story of Mr. Robinson's class is about connections, at\nanother level it is about representation: one group of students places\ncoordinates that \"make things eeeasy,\" the class gains insights from dynamic\nrepresentations of geometric objects, and the students produce proofs\nin coordinate and Euclidean geometry. A major lesson of that story is\nthat different representations support different ways of thinking about\nand manipulating mathematical objects. An object can be better understood\nwhen viewed through multiple lenses. »\n\nIn grades 9–12, students' knowledge and use of representations should\nexpand in scope and complexity. As they study new content, for example,\nstudents will encounter many new representations for mathematical concepts.\nThey will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations.\nMuch of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate\non objects from different perspectives.\n\nIn elementary school, students most often use representations to reason about\nobjects and actions they can perceive directly. In the middle grades,\nstudents increasingly create and use mathematical representations for\nobjects that are not perceived directly, such as rational numbers or rates.\nBy high school, students are working with such increasingly abstract entities\nas functions, matrices, and equations. Using various representations of\nthese objects, students should be able to recognize common mathematical\nstructures across different contexts. For example, the sum of the first\nn odd natural numbers, the areas of square gardens, and the\ndistance traveled by a vehicle that starts at rest and accelerates at\na constant rate can be represented by functions of the form f(x) = ax2.\nThe fact that these situations can be represented by the same class of\nfunctions implies that they are alike in some fundamental mathematical\nway. Students are ready in high school to see similarity in the underlying\nstructure of mathematical objects that appear contextually different but\nwhose representations look quite similar.\n\nHigh school students should be able to create and interpret models of more-complex\nphenomena, drawn from a wider range of contexts, by identifying essential\nfeatures of a situation and by finding representations that capture mathematical\nrelationships among those features. They should recognize, for example,\nthat phenomena with periodic features often are best modeled by trigonometric\nfunctions and that population growth tends to be exponential, or logistic.\nThey will learn » to describe some real-world\nphenomena with iterative and recursive representations.\n\nConsider the graph of the concentration of CO2\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude during the period\nfrom 1986 through 1991 (see fig. 7.39) (Sarmiento 1993). Teachers might\nuse an example such as this to help students understand and interpret\nseveral aspects of representation. Students could discuss the trends in\nthe change in concentration of CO2 as\na function of time as well as latitude. Doing so would draw on their knowledge\nabout classes of functions and their ability to interpret three-dimensional\ngraphs. They should be able to see a roughly linear increase across time,\ncoupled with a sinusoidal fluctuation with the seasons. Focusing on the\nchange in the character of the graph as a function of latitude, students\nshould note that the amplitude of the sinusoidal function lessens from\nnorth to south. Students can test whether the trends they observe in the\ngraph correspond to recent theoretical work on CO2\nconcentration in the atmosphere. For example, the author of the article\nattributes the sinusoidal fluctuation to seasonal variations in the amount\nof photosynthesis taking place in the terrestrial biosphere. Students\ncould discuss the differences in amplitude across seasons in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres.\n\nFig. 7.39. A three-dimensional graph\nof the concentration of C02\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude (Adapted\nfrom Sarmiento [1993])\n\nElectronic technologies\nprovide access to problems and methods that until recently were difficult\nto explore meaningfully in high school. In order to use the technologies\neffectively, students will need to become familiar with the representations\ncommonly used in technological settings. For example, solving equations\nor multiplying matrices using a computer algebra system calls for learning\nhow to input and interpret information in formats used by the system.\nMany software tools that students might use include special icons and\nsymbols that carry particular meaning or are needed to operate the tool;\nstudents will need to learn about these representations and distinguish\nthem from the mathematical objects they are manipulating.\n\nAn important part of learning mathematics is learning to use the language, conventions,\nand representations of mathematics. Teachers should introduce students\nto conventional mathematical representations »\nand help them use those representations effectively by building\non the students' personal and idiosyncratic representations when necessary.\nIt is important for teachers to highlight ways in which different representations\nof the same objects can convey different information and to emphasize\nthe importance of selecting representations suited to the particular mathematical\ntasks at hand (Yerushalmy and Schwartz 1993; Moschkovich, Schoenfeld,\nand Arcavi 1993). For example, tables of values are often useful for quick\nreference, but they provide little information about the nature of the\nfunction represented. Consider the table in the \"Algebra\" section in this\nchapter that gives the number of minutes of daylight in Chicago every\nother day for the year 2000. The values in the table suggest that the\nfunction is initially increasing and then becomes decreasing. Knowledge\nof the context of a graph of those values suggests that the behavior is\nactually periodic. Similarly, algebraic and graphical representations\nof functions may provide different information. Some global properties\nof functions, such as asymptotic behavior or the rate of growth of a function,\nare often most readily apparent from graphs. But information about specific\naspects of a function—the exact value of f() or exact values of\nx where f(x)has a maximum or a minimum—may best\nbe determined using an algebraic representation of the function. Suppose\ng(x) is given by the equation g(x) = f(x)\n+ 1, for all x. The analytic definitions of f(x) and\ng(x) may offer the most-effective ways of computing specific\nvalues of f(x) and g(x), but graphing the function\nreveals that the \"shape\" of g(x) is precisely the same as that\nof f(x)—that the graph of g(x) is obtained by\ntranslating the graph of f(x) one unit upward.\n\nAs in all instruction, what matters is what the student sees, hears, and understands.\nOften, students interpret what teachers may consider wonderfully lucid\npresentations in ways that are very different from those their teachers\nintended (Confrey 1990; Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle 1993). Or they may\ninvent representations of content that are idiosyncratic and have personal\nmeaning but do not look at all like conventional mathematical representations\n(Confrey, 1991; Hall et al. 1989). Part of the teacher's role\nis to help students connect their personal images to more-conventional\nrepresentations. One very useful window into students' thinking is student-generated\nrepresentations. To illustrate this point, consider the following problem\n(adapted from Hughes-Hallett et al. [1994, p. 6]) that might be presented\nto a tenth-grade class:\n\nA flight from SeaTac Airport near Seattle, Washington, to LAX Airport\nin Los Angeles has to circle LAX several times before being allowed\nto land. Plot a graph of the distance of the plane from Seattle against\ntime from the moment of takeoff until landing.\n\nStudents could work individually or in pairs to produce distance-versus-time\ngraphs for this problem, and teachers could ask them to present and defend\nthose graphs to their classmates. Graphs produced by this class, or perhaps\nby students in other classes, could be handed out for careful critique\nand comment. When they perform critiques, students get a considerable\namount of practice in communicating mathematics as well as in constructing\nand improving on representations, and the teacher gets information that\ncan be helpful in assessment. One representation of the flight that a\nstudent might produce is shown in figure 7.40. »\n\nFig. 7.40. A representation that\na student might produce of an airplane's distance from\nits take-off point against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nThis representation indicates a number of interesting and not uncommon misunderstandings,\nin which literal features of the story (the plane flying at constant height\nor circling around the airport) are converted inappropriately into features\nof the graph (Dugdale 1993; Leinhardt, Zaslavsky, and Stein 1990).\nRepresentations of this type can provoke interesting classroom conversations,\nrevealing what the students really understand about graphing. This revelation\nputs the teacher in a better position to move the class toward a more nearly\naccurate representation, as sketched in figure 7.41.\n\nFig. 7.41. A more nearly accurate\nrepresentation of the airplane's distance from its take-off\npoint against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nWhen they perform critiques, students get a considerable\namount of practice in communicating mathematics as well as in constructing\nand improving on representations, and the teacher gets information that\ncan be helpful in assessment.", "function_call_score": 25.188512754692766, "segments_extracted": 18, "original_length": 12466, "filtered_length": 11401, "compression_ratio": 0.9145676239371089}
{"text": "So I currently teach a precalc class and new this year we are required to teach conic section.\nWe cover parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Since I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it? The book we use has a bunch of formulas, but I'm looking for a way to teach it to my students without using all the formulas so they don't have to memorize a bunch of formulas before their exam. What has worked for others?\n\nYou should be able to design good lessons directly based on the book sections. As long as you use a Pre-Calculus book you will have rich enough information available.\n\nBe sure to demonstrate the conic sections using a realistic three-dimensional model. Also use the definitions of each conic section and the distance formula to derive the equation for each conic section, and include the analytical cartesian graph for each.\n\nYou are right on-target about not just giving a bunch of formulas. The demonstration and the derivations are important for learning and understanding.\n\nAs someone who not long ago learnt Conic Sections, I found the derivations of the formula much easier than remembering them. It was good to see the formulas at first but I much preferred the derivations.\n\nI was definitely going to derive the formulas using the distance formula and talk about applications. I wouldn't scratch formulas altogether, but our book has like 8 different formulas, which isn't fair to give all of them to my students if I don't give them on an exam.\n\nSomething one of my physics professors said to our class is recalled to me by this thread. He said students of today are so used to tv games, comics, etc. rather than playing with things with their hands, that they can't visualize 3d objects anymore. He was of course exaggerating. I think it quite odd if a student can't visualize what's going on with conic sections, so yes a model would be quite good. Maybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.\n\nAlso, the old books on geometry, particularly solid geometry, should be good with conic sections, so maybe go down to the library and have a look at them.\n\nAh yes, I have a fun experiment using that! You should certainly teach that!\n\nHere it goes: Dandelin was a Belgian, and some people decided to celebrate him. So what they did was the following. They made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone). And they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone. Then they would sell it to people.I always tought that it was very clever, and it was quite the financial succes too!did they then discover another, smaller, ice-cream (just like discovering another layer of chocolates when you finish the first layer!), which touched the other focus on the other side of the biscuit?\n\nMaybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.\n\nThey made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone).\n\nAnd they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone.", "function_call_score": 33.22456244437852, "segments_extracted": 13, "original_length": 3371, "filtered_length": 3061, "compression_ratio": 0.9080391575200237}

If you are outgoing, strive to know the majority of\nthe people in the class. This will make class time more enjoyable for you\nbut will also help you with your grades. If you have trouble with\nsomething, you will have a peer to ask for help out of class. Lastly,\nwhen your professor gives you the syllabus for the semester, start right\naway!

If they don't make\nany sense to you, at least read the material you will be going over in class\nthe next day thouroughly.\n\nThere have been many things that I have discovered\nover the course of the semester that could be of value to you. First,\nalways keep up with your assignments. Have your assignment done so that\nyou can follow along when your professor lectures about the topic. Some\nof the assigned problems will be difficult and you will not be able to\nunderstand them. When this comes up, make sure that you ask\nquestions. The best way is to ask questions while in class. If\nclass time runs out, do not just forget about the problems you had on the\nassignment, go in and ask your professor during his/her office hours. In\naddition to doing your assignments, take your own notes from the book.\nThis will help you to understand topics covered in lecture better. For\nme, this technique really worked. Once I began to take my own notes in addition\nto the notes I took from my professor's lecture, I did a lot better, especially\non my weekly quizzes. Lastly, everyone messes up sometimes.

{"text": "This practical introduction to the techniques needed to produce high-quality mathematical illustrations is suitable for anyone with basic knowledge of coordinate geometry. Bill Casselman combines a completely self-contained step-by-step introduction to the graphics programming language PostScript with an analysis of the requirements of good mathematical illustrations. The many small simple graphics projects can also be used in courses in geometry, graphics, or general mathematics. Code for many of the illustrations is included, and can be downloaded from the book's web site:  scientists, engineers, and even graphic designers seeking help in creating technical illustrations need look no further.\n\nMathematical Explorations with MATLAB examines the mathematics most frequently encountered in first-year university courses. A key feature of the book is its use of MATLAB, a popular and powerful software package. The book's emphasis is on understanding and investigating the mathematics by putting the mathematical tools into practice in a wide variety of modeling situations. Even readers who have no prior experience with MATLAB will gain fluency. The book covers a wide range of material: matrices, whole numbers, complex numbers, geometry of curves and families of lines, data analysis, random numbers and simulations, and differential equations from the basic mathematics. These lessons are applied to a rich variety of investigations and modeling problems, from sequences of real numbers to cafeteria queues, from card shuffling to models of fish growth. All extras to the standard MATLAB package are supplied on the World Wide Web.\n\nThis unique book provides a streamlined, self-contained and modern text for a one-semester mathematical methods course with an emphasis on concepts important from the application point of view. Part I of this book follows the \"paper and pencil\" presentation of mathematical methods that emphasizes fundamental understanding and geometrical intuition. In addition to a complete list of standard subjects, it introduces important, contemporary topics like nonlinear differential equations, chaos and solitons. Part II employs the Maple software to cover the same topics as in Part I in a computer oriented approach to instruction.
