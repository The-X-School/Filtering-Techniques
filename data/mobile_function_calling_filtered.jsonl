Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.\n\nControl your physical self.\n\nPass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive.

I have a daughter who really doesn't like math. I took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights. ;) ) She surprised me and picked Saxon. It is extremely black and white and not like the colorful books we have used before. She loves it so far and seems to be grasping the concepts.

I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding. Saxon Math has helped me while I have been teaching. It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.\n\nI have found Saxon Math to be very thorough. I have used Saxon 1, 2, 3 and 5/4 now. Thus far, we have been very pleased with the curriculum. It allows me, the teacher to move a quickly or as slowly as the student needs. I am able to use the tests and assessments included in the student workbook to determine where to place the child and to even skip ahead if needed so that valuable time is not spent on things already mastered. The Teachers Manual is able to be reused with other students, but we always purchase a new workbook for each new student. The price of the workbooks are very reasonable.\n\nI took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights.\n\nThere is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math.", "function_calling_score": 65.15274398486078, "score_breakdown": {"commands": 66, "actions": 144, "devices": 0, "conversations": 22, "keywords": 9}, "pattern_matches": {"Communication commands": 2, "Action verbs for mobile functions": 4, "E-commerce function calls": 2, "Time-based triggers": 2}, "quality_indicators": {"has_direct_commands": true, "has_device_interactions": true, "has_time_scheduling": true, "has_conversation_patterns": false, "action_diversity": 4, "is_mobile_optimized": true, "command_density": 0.017842660178426603}, "segments_extracted": 14, "command_types": {"command_sentence": 1, "dialogue_exchange": 1}, "original_length": 3699, "filtered_length": 3784, "mobile_optimization_score": 17.842660178426602, "top_command_scores": [200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0]}

For students, learning mathematics is not just about the memorization of concepts and formulas, but it is also about the journey of learning how to problem solve. By breaking the sections down into manageable chunks, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle, and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward. Proven pedagogical features, such as You Try problems after each example, reinforce a student's mastery of a concept. While teaching in the classroom, Messersmith has created worksheets for each section that fall into three categories: review worksheets/basic skills, worksheets to teach new content, and worksheets to reinforce/pull together different concepts. These worksheets are a great way to both enhance instruction and to give the students more tools to be successful in studying a given topic.

One of my classes was algebra. I had math anxiety and tried to find way to wiggle my way out of this class. The algebra class was very difficult for me. I could not understand the instructor or the book. I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both). So I had a six week break before I had to take the algebra class again. I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!\n\nDanica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school.", "function_calling_score": 48.77721042730449, "score_breakdown": {"commands": 64, "actions": 275, "devices": 0, "conversations": 0, "keywords": 24}, "pattern_matches": {"Communication commands": 1, "Navigation commands": 1, "Action verbs for mobile functions": 11}, "quality_indicators": {"has_direct_commands": true, "has_device_interactions": true, "has_time_scheduling": false, "has_conversation_patterns": false, "action_diversity": 3, "is_mobile_optimized": true, "command_density": 0.00859983875302338}, "segments_extracted": 15, "command_types": {"command_sentence": 1, "dialogue_exchange": 1}, "original_length": 7442, "filtered_length": 5160, "mobile_optimization_score": 8.59983875302338, "top_command_scores": [200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0]}

However, the convergence of such series is a delicate issue closely related to the theory of integration. A standard approach to integration on the real line, formalised by Riemann, is based on partitioning the domain into smaller intervals. (This theory was described in MATH20101 but is not a prerequisite for the course.) This approach works in many situations but there are simple examples for which it fails. In the early 1900s, H. Lebesgue produced a better theory in which the key idea is to extend the notion of length from intervals to more complicated subsets of R. This started an area of mathematics it its own right, called Measure Theory. Most generally, this is about how one may sensibly assign a size to members of a collection of sets.

So when you check your results and think you got it wrong - try it again. The answer given is off by 20. This would be unbelievable in a self teaching guide if I didn't have it right in front of me.

Katz received his PhD in mathematics from Brandeis University in 1968 and has been Professor of Mathematics at the University of the District of Columbia for many years. He has long been interested in the history of mathematics and, in particular, in its use in teaching. He is the editor of The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India and Islam: A Sourcebook (2007). He has edited or co-edited two recent books dealing with this subject, Learn from the Masters (1994) and Using History to Teach Mathematics (2000). Dr. Katz also co-edited a collection of historical articles taken from MAA journals of the past 90 years, Sherlock Holmes in Babylon and other Tales of Mathematical History. He has directed two NSF-sponsored projects to help college teachers learn the history of mathematics and learn to use it in teaching. Dr. Katz has also involved secondary school teachers in writing materials using history in the teaching of various topics in the high school curriculum. These materials, Historical Modules for the Teaching and Learning of Mathematics, have now been published by the MAA. Currently, Dr. Katz is the PI on an NSF grant to the MAA that supports Convergence, an online magazine devoted to the history of mathematics and its use in teaching", "function_calling_score": 22.385771235817234, "score_breakdown": {"commands": 0, "actions": 50, "devices": 0, "conversations": 11, "keywords": 12}, "pattern_matches": {"Action verbs for mobile functions": 2, "Time-based triggers": 1}, "quality_indicators": {"has_direct_commands": false, "has_device_interactions": true, "has_time_scheduling": true, "has_conversation_patterns": false, "action_diversity": 2, "is_mobile_optimized": false, "command_density": 0.0}, "segments_extracted": 7, "command_types": {"command_sentence": 1, "dialogue_exchange": 1}, "original_length": 3261, "filtered_length": 2850, "mobile_optimization_score": 0.0, "top_command_scores": [171.77914110429447, 82.84023668639053, 74.27055702917772, 58.8235294117647, 37.974683544303794]}

Simple calculator is a general purpose calculator which combines use simplicity and calculation power. It handles simple arithmetic operations and complex formulas. Advanced Calculator is a step farther in complexity comparing to the Simple Calculator. The Advanced Calculator has two editing windows. One is for editing x, and the second is for editing f(x). In the x window you can enter any number or formula which contains numbers. In the f(x) window you can enter formulas containing numbers and formulas containing x. First, x will be calculated. Then the result for x will be substituted into the formula for f(x). The presence of two editing windows demands switching between windows. You can do it by clicking buttons \"go to x\" and \"go to f(x)\", or by clicking inside the window. If you forget to enter x, then the x=1 will be assumed. If you forget to enter f(x), then f(x)=x will be assumed. Advanced Calculator works in scientific mode. All numbers in internal calculations are treated in scientific format. Graphing Calculator 2D has two panels. The Left Panel has the Magnifying Square represented by Small Square with gray border on the Left Panel. It is 16 times smaller than the Left Panel. The Right Panel shows content of the Magnifying Square magnified 16 times. You can press button \"zoom +\". Then the Left and Right Panels will be zoomed twice each.

Lastly, students will find a variety of applications to engage their interest, demonstrated via economics, traffic flow, anthropology, Google searches, computer graphics, or music to name a few. By leveraging technology and incorporating engaging examples and numerous practice problems and exercises, this text best serves the needs of students attempting to master linear algebra.[read more0131871412 ALMOST BRAND NEW.

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \"algebra\" broadly, defining it as a \"method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance\". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is \"the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge\" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments.

{"text": "The novel idea of this slim, succinct book is to seek to replace reliance on these equations with geometric reasoning.\n\nThere is also a book by Callahan with the similar-sounding title The Geometry of Spacetime, but that book is considerably different than this one; unlike this text, it covers both general and special relativity (so \"geometry\" as used in the title of that book really refers to differential geometry, which finds extensive use) and the discussion of special relativity in the first half of the book emphasizes linear algebra notation; matrix computations appear throughout.\n\nSo, while I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned from it, I tend to think that it would serve best as a supplemental text for a course in special relativity rather than as a main text.\n\nThis is unquestionably a book that anybody who teaches special relativity will want to look at.\n\nThis is consistent with a primary idea in Dray's book (that the Lorentz transformation is really just a hyperbolic rotation) but the manner of presentation is different.\n\nThere are thirteen substantial worked-out examples in the book, all of which struck me as both interesting and illuminating; instead of scattering them throughout the text the author puts them all in three chapters (7, 10 and 12) devoted entirely to them.\n\n\" This goal, I think, has been met: on more than one occasion as I read this book I found myself looking at other texts to compare discussions, and I generally found that the process seemed to have a synergistic effect: I got more out of both books by doing this.\n\nDespite the fact that there are at least two other books (one quite recent) with titles that are very similar to this book's, Dray's approach really does appear to be novel. Dragon's new book The Geometry of Special Relativity: A Concise Course, for example, seems (based on an admittedly cursory glance) to be addressed to a considerably more sophisticated audience than is this text, and while geometric ideas are certainly mentioned the ones that are discussed in Dray do not appear to take center stage in Dragon. There is also a book by Callahan with the similar-sounding title The Geometry of Spacetime, but that book is considerably different than this one; unlike this text, it covers both general and special relativity (so \"geometry\" as used in the title of that book really refers to differential geometry, which finds extensive use) and the discussion of special relativity in the first half of the book emphasizes linear algebra notation; matrix computations appear throughout. This is consistent with a primary idea in Dray's book (that the Lorentz transformation is really just a hyperbolic rotation) but the manner of presentation is different. (Anybody planning to look at both books should also note that Callahan, in contravention of what I believe is now standard practice, uses the horizontal, rather than vertical, axis for time.) Finally, I should perhaps mention Taylor and Wheeler's Spacetime Physics, endorsed by the author but unseen by me, which apparently contained a lot of this material in its first edition but left much out of it out of the second.\n\nThe question then arises, of course, whether \"novel\" necessarily means \"better\". I found that the geometric discussions did shed some light on the underlying ideas, but I also thought at times that the calculations used in them were just disguised versions of the calculations used from a more traditional approach (which, I think, any serious student of special relativity should be familiar with, since these ideas appear so frequently in the literature). So, while I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned from it, I tend to think that it would serve best as a supplemental text for a course in special relativity rather than as a main text. (The very succinct writing style, and the total lack of homework exercises, also influenced this opinion.) The author himself may think this, because he writes in the preface that the book \"is not intended as a replacement for any of the excellent textbooks on special relativity\" but is intended as an introduction \"to a particularly beautiful way of looking at special relativity… encouraging students to see beyond the formulas to the deeper structure.\" This goal, I think, has been met: on more than one occasion as I read this book I found myself looking at other texts to compare discussions, and I generally found that the process seemed to have a synergistic effect: I got more out of both books by doing this. This is unquestionably a book that anybody who teaches special relativity will want to look at.\n\nDragon's new book The Geometry of Special Relativity: A Concise Course, for example, seems (based on an admittedly cursory glance) to be addressed to a considerably more sophisticated audience than is this text, and while geometric ideas are certainly mentioned the ones that are discussed in Dray do not appear to take center stage in Dragon.\n\nThe book concludes with two chapters that are really just straight mathematics, no physics: one chapter (\"Hyperbolic Geometry\") discusses various models for hyperbolic geometry, and the other (\"Calculus\") offers a geometric derivation of the trigonometric and exponential functions.\n\nThe book concludes with two chapters that are really just straight mathematics, no physics: one chapter (\"Hyperbolic Geometry\") discusses various models for hyperbolic geometry, and the other (\"Calculus\") offers a geometric derivation of the trigonometric and exponential functions.\n\nThere are thirteen substantial worked-out examples in the book, all of which struck me as both interesting and illuminating; instead of scattering them throughout the text the author puts them all in three chapters (7, 10 and 12) devoted entirely to them. There are no exercises, but the author does occasionally explicitly leave something to the reader to ponder, such as the resolution of the \"manhole cover\" paradox in chapter 8.\n\n) The author himself may think this, because he writes in the preface that the book \"is not intended as a replacement for any of the excellent textbooks on special relativity\" but is intended as an introduction \"to a particularly beautiful way of looking at special relativity… encouraging students to see beyond the formulas to the deeper structure.\n\n)\n\nThe book starts with two introductory chapters, the first of which (very) rapidly contrasts Newton's and Einstein's physics and the second of which functions as a quick overview of the physics of special relativity, including the derivation of the Lorentz equations from the two basic postulates of special relativity (that the laws of physics apply in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers).", "function_calling_score": 58.77205775120315, "score_breakdown": {"commands": 66, "actions": 325, "devices": 0, "conversations": 0, "keywords": 12}, "pattern_matches": {"Communication commands": 2, "Action verbs for mobile functions": 13}, "quality_indicators": {"has_direct_commands": true, "has_device_interactions": true, "has_time_scheduling": false, "has_conversation_patterns": false, "action_diversity": 2, "is_mobile_optimized": true, "command_density": 0.009625200525010938}, "segments_extracted": 15, "command_types": {"command_sentence": 1, "dialogue_exchange": 1}, "original_length": 6857, "filtered_length": 6787, "mobile_optimization_score": 9.625200525010937, "top_command_scores": [200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 147.92899408284023]}

This book presents not only the major themes of discrete mathematics, but also the reasoning that underlies mathematical thought. Students develop the ability to think abstractly as they study the ideas of logic and proof. While learning about such concepts as logic circuits and computer addition, algorithm analysis, recursive thinking, computability, automata, cryptography, and combinatorics, students discover that the ideas of discrete mathematics underlie and are essential to the science and technology of the computer age.

In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. The book should be welcomed by graduate students and researchers in a variety of mathematical fields both as an advanced text and as a modern reference work.

Not only did Cauchy provide a workable definition of limits and a means to make them the basis of a rigorous theory of calculus, but he also revitalized the idea that all mathematics could be set on such rigorous foundations. Today, the quality of a work of mathematics is judged in part on the quality of its rigor, and this standard is largely due to the transformation brought about by Cauchy and the Cours d'analyse.

In this way, the text communicates to students, the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, helping to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. The authors included in this edition, Problem-Recognition exercises, that many instructors will likely identify to be similar to worksheets they have personally developed for distribution to students. The intent of the Problem-Recognition exercises, is to help students overcome what is sometimes a natural inclination toward applying problem-sovling algorithms that may not always be appropriate. In addition, the exercise sets have been revised to include even more core exercises than were present in the first edition. This permits instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills and develop the knowledge they need to make a successful transition into College Algebra.

The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding.\nThis edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications. The text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers.

Grading System: All assignments are expected to be done neatly, on time, and honestly. a. Overall grade is calculated as a weighted average, described below. Homework 10% - must be done completely, with work shown, and turned in on time. Late homework (1 day) will be accepted at half-credit. HOMEWORK IS ASSIGNED FREQUENTLY! Participation 10% - notes, supplies, cooperation, class participation, projects, classwork. Quizzes 30% - Twice a week, usually. Often announced, sometimes unannounced (pop quiz) Tests 50% - All tests will be announced. Passing grade for tests, quizzes and the class is 60%. *************************************************************************** * To be eligible to take the chapter tests, a student must have all homework turned in * * before the test day. Any student who chooses to avoid his/her homework will be * * expected to complete their homework during the test, and MAKE UP THE TEST DURING * * BARK PERIOD. * *************************************************************************** b. Calculation of overall grade 95% - 100% = A+ 75% - 79% = C+ 90% - 94% = A 70% - 74% = C 85% - 90% = B+ 65% - 69% = D+ - avoid this!! 80% - 84 % = B 60% - 64% = D - avoid this!! Below 60% is failing, and will receive an F c. Make-up work for EXCUSED absences - must be done within a \"reasonable\" amount of time - Typically, one day of make-up time for each day of absence. It is the student's responsibility to get any missed notes from a classmate. Missed exams or quizzes must be made up within one week. The student is expected to pursue and complete all missing assignments. Those not made up within the stated time frame will receive a score of Zero. d. ZANGLE and Student Connect. I post grades regularly on Zangle – usually within a week. e. Cheating Policy (VUSD) A student who attempts to or gains an unfair advantage over any other student because of unacceptable behavior is subject to the following: Level One - zero on the assignment or test, conference with the student, contact the parent and send copy of form B to both parent and the Assistant Principal Level Two - zero on the assignment, 2 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Three - zero on the assignment, 5 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Four – Student shall be transferred from the high school and placed in alternative placement 5. Rules and Expectations. My rules are fairly simple – RESPECT for all - This means treat others how you wish to be treated. Use appropriate language and tone. Respect property – DO YOUR BEST. What you get from this class depends largely on what you put into it! – SEEK RESOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS - don't ignore them, they could get worse. – FOLLOW CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS Students will be expected to · Be in their seatwhen the tardy bell rings, with BOOK, supplies, ready to begin · Participate in all class work. Stay focused. · Pay attention, take notes during instruction, and ask questions · Keep all electronic distractions in their backpacks. CD players, video games and cell phones will be turned over to their administrator if used during class · Stay in assigned seat until dismissed. -TARDY It is important to be on time and prepared for class when the bell rings. I keep track of tardy arrivals; you will be expected to serve a class detention for your tardies. 6. Consequences Failure to meet the above rules and expectations will result in disciplinary action, according to school policy. (Verbal reminder, conference, removal of privilege, phone call to Parents, counseling referral, administrative referral.) 7. SUPPLIES – to be well prepared, please bring to class ●A 3-ring binder: 2 inches is best. You'll be getting lots of papers. ●Dividers – separate notebook into Notes/Homework/Journals/Quizzes/Extra Paper ●Loose leaf paper ●Graph paper ●Pencils! # 2 pencils, an eraser and colored pencils (pens are not for math) ●Highlighters ●Book Cover – not the adhesive kind ●a Compass and Protractor ●A scientific calculator. I recommend the TI-30Xa or similar. 8. Contact information. Please contact me with any questions or concerns. Student success is the goal, and I am happy to discuss any ways to help your student succeed. 805-289-1842, ext 2151 or diane.elrod@venturausd.org my web page is vusdmathelrod.weebly.com Sincerely, Diane B.

Hand-in work by the specified\ntime and date in the relevant 4W level 1 slot. Your tutor will comment on your work, which should be returned\nto you about a week later. It is a crime to go to a tutorial without having tried the problems\non the current sheet. It is also a crime to go to a tutorial without knowing the meaning of every word\nused on the problem sheet (since if you do not understand the words, you will not understand the questions).\nIt is most definitely not a crime to be stuck, confused or bamboozled, and your tutor should be able to help you there.\nDo not ask your tutor to show you how to do the problems. Rather your tutor should help you understand the problems\nwith sufficient insight that you can do some of the problems yourself. Problems come in varying levels of difficulty,\nand it would be an extraordinary student who could regularly do them all.\nWhat do you do if you think I have made an error in lectures, on a question sheet or on a solution sheet?

Proofs are introduced in the first chapter and continue throughout the book. Most students taking discrete mathematics are mathematics and computer science majors. Although the necessity of learning to do proofs is obvious for mathematics majors, ...it is also critical for computer science students to think logically. Essentially, a logical bug-free computer program is equivalent to a logical proof. Also, it is assumed in this book that it is easier to use (or at least not misuse) an application if one understands why it works. With few exceptions, the book is self-contained. Concepts are developed mathematically before they are seen in an applied context. Additions and alterations in the second edition: More coverage of proofs, especially in Chapter 1. Added computer science applications, such as a greedy algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph, a recursive algorithm for counting the number of nodes on a binary search tree, or an efficient algorithm for computinga b modnfor very large values ofa, b,andn. An extensive increase in the number of problems in the first eight chapters. More problems are included that involve proofs. Additional material is included on matrices. Inclusion of finite states with output and Turing machines. True-False questions at the end of each chapter. Summary questions at the end of each chapter. A glossary at the end of each chapter. Functions and sequences are introduced earlier (in Chapter 2). Calculus is not required for any of the material in this book. College algebra is adequate for the basic chapters. However, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than do the basic chapters, so calculus is recommended more for giving maturity, than for any direct uses. This book is intended for either a one- or two-term course in discrete mathematics. The first eight chapters of this book provide a foundation in discrete mathematics and would be appropriate for a first-level course for freshmen or sophomores. These chapters are essentially independent, so that the instructor can pick the material he/she wishes to cover. The remainder of the book contains appropriate material for a second course in discrete mathematics. These chapters expand concepts introduced earlier and introduce numerous advanced topics. Topics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings. The range of topics include: Logic--Including truth tables, propositional logic, predicate calculus, circuits, induction, and proofs. Set Theory--Including cardinality of sets, relations, partially ordered sets, congruence relations, graphs, directed graphs, and functions. Algorithms--Including complexity of algorithms, search and sort algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm, Huffman's algorithm, Prim's algorithms, Warshall's algorithm, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithms. Graph Theory--Including directed graphs, Euler cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles and paths, planar graphs, and weighted graphs. Trees--including binary search trees, weighted trees, tree transversal, Huffman's codes, and spanning trees. Combinatorics--including permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion, partitions, generating functions, Catalan numbers, Sterling numbers, Rook Polynomials, derangements, and enumeration of colors. Algebra--Including semigroups, groups, lattices, semilattices, Boolean algebras, rings, fields, integral domains,[\n\nit is also critical for computer science students to think logically.\n\nAdded computer science applications, such as a greedy algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph, a recursive algorithm for counting the number of nodes on a binary search tree, or an efficient algorithm for computinga b modnfor very large values ofa, b,andn.", "function_calling_score": 48.81232054293918, "score_breakdown": {"commands": 0, "actions": 175, "devices": 0, "conversations": 0, "keywords": 12}, "pattern_matches": {"Action verbs for mobile functions": 7}, "quality_indicators": {"has_direct_commands": false, "has_device_interactions": true, "has_time_scheduling": false, "has_conversation_patterns": false, "action_diversity": 1, "is_mobile_optimized": true, "command_density": 0.0}, "segments_extracted": 11, "command_types": {"command_sentence": 1, "dialogue_exchange": 1}, "original_length": 3831, "filtered_length": 5182, "mobile_optimization_score": 0.0, "top_command_scores": [200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 175.0]}

The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book.

Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere?

In particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations. A showcase of these activities is freely available at the Mathwright website. Visitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.1), necessary for using the activities.\n\nProject WELCOME has many features in common with MAA professional development programs. The faculty developers will each be teamed with an experienced Mathwright user who will serve as a mentor and collaborator. The goals of the project go beyond training new Mathwright developers. The idea is to foster a community of teachers using interactive explorations. The community will interact electronically through email and a project web page. In addition, participants will get together at national MAA meetings, where they will be encouraged to make presentations of their work. In particular, there will be several contributed paper presentations related to WELCOME at the January, 2001 meeting in New Orleans.\n\nVisitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.\n\nIn order to bring interactive mathematical explorations to these students, WELCOME is enlisting the aid of their teachers. The Project will build a community of Mathwright developers among faculty in institutions which predominantly serve the target populations. The role of teachers in developing, as well as using, Mathwright activities is intentional and significant. For one thing, creating the activities themselves will give the teachers a greater sense of ownership, and will assure that the activities will be compatible with the instructional goals and philosophies of these teachers. There is another reason to involve teachers as developers. Presumably, the historical under-participation among some student populations reflects particular obstacles that these students face. If so, then faculty at institutions which serve these populations may have special insights about the nature of the obstacles and strategies for overcoming them. Such insights will be a valuable resource in developing Mathwright activities for Project WELCOME.\n\nEach year of the project begins with a workshop for new faculty particpants and mentors. In 2000, the summer workshop was held in Seattle, and was attended by 6 new faculty developers, 4 mentors, as well as the project directors. During the 2000-2001 academic year the developer teams will work on Mathwright activities related to the classes of the new faculty developers. Work in progress will be shared at the winter 2001 math meetings, and more completed work at the summer meeting. At about the same time, a new class of faculty developers will be meet in a workshop, as mentioned earlier.\n\nThe goal of each activity is to encourage students to experiment with some mathematical context by manipulating aspects of the environment and observing the results.\n\nMathematical Involvement of Underrepresented Groups\n\nThe MAA has an ongoing interest in increasing the participation in mathematics of historically underrepresented groups.\n\nIn particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations.\n\nWELCOME\nbrings together elements of three MAA program themes: academic technology, professional development, and promoting involvement of historically underrepresented groups.\n\nLaunched in May, 2000, with the support of an NSF grant, Project WELCOME is a new part of the\nSUMMA Program.

Unlike other books, this one \"teaches by example\". I always found that too many college professors & textbooks spend too much time trying to \"explain\" the concept.

Math is often about making connections as so many concepts are interrelated, be sure to record the connections you make. Areas where you have concerns or believe to be your greatest weakness are also the areas you should emphasize. To emphasize, you may wish to use a highligher and attach a few stickies. Personally, I prefer to date my notes as well, sometimes I include the text pages for handy reference.\n\nExplain your reasoning. This component is key, keep it short and sweet but explain the logic behind the application or procedure.\n\nWhen studying for math, we often use exercises, worksheets and sample problems to work through in order to prepare for an upcoming test, exam or review. However, as in most other subjects, note taking and journaling is also very effective and very important to help with the understanding of specific math concepts. Whether you dictate your notes and have them available for audio, or write your notes to review them visually, the strategies and tips here will help you better prepare for math tests and exams. Effective notes will help you to remember important concepts taught in class and they will guide you through various math problems.\n\nTaking Notes\n\nI prefer to use the two column approach in my notes and I also prefer to use pencil.\n\nMath Symbols is great for creating exercises and it allows you to create your equations quickly (newer version has handwriting recognition) but you'll still need another application to integrate it with.\n\nTo use the two column approach, your actual notes will be on one side and the examples or theorems/forumulas will be on the other.\n\nTips for Improving Your Note Taking Skills\n\nListen carefully to your instructor and jot down the key points about solving problems, proving theorems or using a procedure.", "function_calling_score": 40.52026013006503, "score_breakdown": {"commands": 97, "actions": 50, "devices": 0, "conversations": 0, "keywords": 15}, "pattern_matches": {"Communication commands": 2, "Navigation commands": 1, "Action verbs for mobile functions": 2}, "quality_indicators": {"has_direct_commands": true, "has_device_interactions": true, "has_time_scheduling": false, "has_conversation_patterns": false, "action_diversity": 3, "is_mobile_optimized": true, "command_density": 0.024262131065532766}, "segments_extracted": 15, "command_types": {"command_sentence": 1, "dialogue_exchange": 1}, "original_length": 3998, "filtered_length": 3392, "mobile_optimization_score": 24.262131065532767, "top_command_scores": [200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 200.0, 124.37810945273631]}

Students' mathematical knowledge must be connected to the ideas and skills found in all grade levels, as well as to real life situations outside the classroom.\n\nProcedural Proficiency: Skills, facts, and procedures\n\nStudents who demonstrate procedural proficiency can:\n• quickly recall basic facts (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division)\n• use standard algorithms – step-by-step mathematical procedures – to produce a correct solution or answer (might also include multiple algorithms)\n• use generalized procedures (such as the steps involved in solving an algebraic equation)\n• demonstrate fluency with procedures:\no perform the procedure immediately and accurately\no know when to use a particular procedure in a problem or situation\no use the procedure as a tool that can be applied reflexively, and doesn't distract from the task at hand (procedure is stored in long-term memory)\n\nProblem-solving and Processes: reasoning and thinking to apply mathematical content\n\nStudents must be able to:\n• reason\n• solve problems\n• communicate theirunderstanding in effective ways\n• solve increasingly complex problems from grade to grade\n• use increasingly sophisticated language and symbols to communicate their understanding, from grade to grade\n\nStudents may substitute a state-approved option for Algebra II, but should check with colleges regarding admission requirements.\n\nStudents who demonstrate procedural proficiency can:\n• quickly recall basic facts (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division)\n• use standard algorithms – step-by-step mathematical procedures – to produce a correct solution or answer (might also include multiple algorithms)\n• use generalized procedures (such as the steps involved in solving an algebraic equation)\n• demonstrate fluency with procedures:\no perform the procedure immediately and accurately\no know when to use a particular procedure in a problem or situation\no use the procedure as a tool that can be applied reflexively, and doesn't distract from the task at hand (procedure is stored in long-term memory)\n\n*A small number of students – generally those in the APP program at the elementary level - will participate in mathematics two years above grade level.
