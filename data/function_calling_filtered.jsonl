{"text": "My Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.", "original_score": 13.103891671881604, "segments_extracted": 9}

{"text": "So I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nIf you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory.

In light of this guidance, the study of Logarithmic and Exponential functions plays a very important role in secondary education, particularly in providing a way to model some of the real world problems that students meet outside of the classroom. Such problems are found in diverse places as medicine and finance, as well as, advanced mathematics and politics. More likely than not, if one asked those who studied mathematics in secondary school 25 years ago why they studied exponentials and logarithms, other than to learn about slide rule computation, many would say it was because the topic was a chapter in their textbook that had to be covered. One wonders why something that made a major impact on mathematics four centuries ago became so meaningless to the secondary students of the latter half of the 20th century, the \"new math\" era. Fortunately, textbooks which embody the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics today reward the student with the theory of exponents and logarithms along with the study of contemporary applications giving meaning to the study. In 1989, the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, which The Principles and Standards for School Mathematics were designed to build upon, were released. The document encouraged that attention be focused \"on the need for student awareness of the interaction between mathematics and the historical situations from which it has developed and the impact that interaction has on or culture and our lives\" (p.6). There is no doubt that the study of the history of exponents and logarithms is a prime example of how \"theoretical mathematics (which) has burgeoned in its diversity and deepened in its complexity and abstraction...has become more ... vital to our technologically oriented society\" (p.6). Goals of the Module: 1. To understand the historical background leading to the development of exponents, exponentials, and logarithms and to see how mathematical concepts evolve over periods of time. 2. To provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge of exponents and logarithms to various concrete situations and problems in a historical context. 3. To show students the connection between exponential functions and logarithmic functions, that is the inverse relationship they share with one another. 4. To develop in students an appreciation of the history connected with the development of exponents and logarithms.\n4\nHow to use this module: The authors realize this module contains more material than most teachers can squeeze into an already overcrowded syllabus. It is recommended that the teacher review the material and pick and choose those topics that best fit teacher and students' needs. The material can be made to fit many different types of objectives, and it can be made to fit many different lesson plans. It may even be of interest to teachers of subjects other than mathematics. General historical material may be used for group or whole class discussion. Some quotations and biographical sketches may be more appropriate for introductory material while some are best used within activities. Students should be able to locate the places mentioned on a world map. The written assignments that are required in some of the activities could also include connections with units in social studies, science, economics, etc. If more comprehensive studies are required or desired, the authors have included a bibliography for students and teachers interested in the further study of content in the module. Time Schedule Time needed will depend on the activities and materials the individual teacher chooses to use and the level of the class. The activities may be used to introduce the topic and then further work may be accomplished using exercises found in student textbooks. The teacher is in no way obliged to ask students to perform all these activities; one is not constrained to follow the suggested sequence in which the activities are listed nor to follow the teacher hints. The authors believe that the history will enable students to understand the mathematics better. It is further suggested that the mathematics teacher team teach parts of this module with a history or social science teacher, if such an arrangement can be made. Materials Needed It is highly recommended that the teacher post a world map. Other materials which may be needed in these activities are: machine tape, straightedge, compass, ruler, lined paper, graphing paper, graphing calculator or graphing utility, computers. .Classroom Organization: When using the exploratory activities and projects of this module appears to be the appropriate time to have the class organized into cooperative groups. Using a constructivist approach, the lessons have been created with questions or hints that are designed to guide the student toward \"discovering\" the relevant results. The quotations of mathematicians may be best presented to the class as a whole on overhead transparencies; copies may be made for personal study by the students.\n5\nSuggested Courses for Using Module Activities\nActivity Exponent Notation According to Newton Properties of Exponential Functions Properties of Exponents Compound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase What Will Happen If....?

Lord Moulton, The Invention of Logarithms, Its Genesis and Growth (NTV, 21) The discovery of logarithms is attributed to the Scottish mathematician John Napier; in this section, you will be able to learn about Napier's life, how he formulated the first view of logarithms, and how they were quickly transformed during his own lifetime into something different. The temptation is severe to recast all of Napier's work through the lens of our present interpretation of logarithms, but the actual story is every bit as impressive. Moulton's quote above is useful to keep in mind when we consider the path which Napier took. John Napier was born into an influential and well-to-do family in 1550 in the family estate at Murchiston Castle near Edinburgh, Scotland as the eldest son of Archibald and Janet Napier. Before his death (also at Murchiston) in 1617, he was to become a theologian and an ardent supporter of the Protestant faith, an inventor of weaponry, and an exceptional mathematician. In mathematics, he was known for his work on spherical trigonometry, his invention of an early form of a mechanical calculator, and in particular, his discovery of and work with logarithms. It is also the case that Napier's name was spelled a variety of different ways, including by himself, among them being: Napeir, Nepeir, Neper, Nepper, Naper, Napare, and Naipper. We will adopt the spelling in ordinary usage at the present time. We really know quite little about Napier's early life. It seems he was a student at University of St. Andrews, but he never earned a degree there. He may have traveled abroad, but by 1571 he had returned to the family estates in Scotland where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Stirling in 1572, and after she died in 1579, he married Agnes Chisholm. He had a son and a daughter by his first wife and five sons and five daughters by his second. At this time in Scotland, religious strive was rampant. King James VI of Scotland had designs on the English throne, and there were rumors of the involvement of King Philip II of Spain in those plans. The issue of whether Scotland would become Catholic or Protestant became a widespread concern, and Napier came down very firmly on the side of the Protestants. Scotland suffered through a civil war in 1570-72, and in 1588 the English defeated the Spanish Armada. In 1593 Napier wrote the Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John; to gain a sense of this book, consider the following quote from a letter addressed to King James which formed the dedication: \"...let it be your Majesty's continuall study...to reforme the universall enormities of your country, and first...to begin at your Majesty's owne house, familie and court, and purge the same of all suspicion of Papists and Atheists and Newtralls...\" (NTV, 42) The book was widely read; between 1593 and 1645 there were 5 English editions, 2 Dutch editions, 5 French editions, and 3 in German. In it, among other things, Napier declared the Pope to be the Antichrist and predicted \"that the day of God's judgement appears to fall betwixt the years of Christ 1688 and 1700.\"\n10\nThere is strong evidence that probably as early as 1594, Napier had begun to investigate certain properties of calculations which would make working with the trigonometric values of sines considerably easier to do in order to facilitate the computations involved in astronomy. The German mathematician Michael Stifel wrote the Arithmetica integra in 1544, and it contained a clear statement relating the arithmetic sequence of integers (1, 2, 3...) with the corresponding geometric sequence of 2 raised to those powers ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 , ...), and this may have suggested the possibility to Napier of using sums to compute products. Stifel even called the powers `exponents' and discussed what we would describe as \"when you multiply the numbers, you add the exponents.\" Napier was also visited by Dr. John Craig, a member of the Scottish royal court, who met had the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1590 and seen some of Tycho's work with prosthaphaeresis. This was a long-known method of using \"product to sum\" formulas: namely, such trigonometric identities as 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x y). Whatever the impetus, in 1614 Napier published the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) and then posthumously in 1619 the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio (Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) was published. It appears as if Napier wished his work to be as widely accessible as possible, and to this end he aided in Edward Wright's translation of the Descriptio into English in 1616. In this translation he explained that his intent with logarithms was to aid in the calculations involved in multiplication, division, and the taking of roots: Seeing Napier coined the word `logarithm' from the Greek words logos (ratio) and arithmos (number), and his original definition takes some getting used to, compared to our present interpretation of a logarithm. Keep in mind as well that he originally was working strictly with the sines of angles. In proposition 26 in the Constructio he states: \"The logarithm of a given sine is that number which has increased arithmetically with the same velocity throughout as that with which radius began to decrease geometrically, and in the same time as radius has decreased to the given sine.\" (Napier, p. 19) T b g a S i\nIn the figure above, imagine that TS is a line segment of 10 7 units, and that bi is a ray from b. (Napier chose 10 7 for his radius so that he could use values of sines accurate to 7 decimal places but treat them as integers. It is also the case that Napier was one of the first mathematicians to widely use the decimal point as we now write it to separate the integer from the decimal fractional part of a number.) A point g starts at T and moves towards S at a rate\n11\nequal to its distance from S; at the same time that g starts at T, point a starts at b and moves towards i at the same rate as g's initial velocity. The distance from b to a is then the logarithm of the length from g to S. There are some immediate conclusions that can be reached, stressing the difference from this original view of logarithms and our present perspective. Let Nap. log stand for Napier's definition. First, if g is still at T, then the point a is still at b; therefore, Nap. log 10 7 = 0 and Nap. log is a decreasing function. Second, it can be shown that Nap. log (xy) = Nap. log x + Nap. log y Nap. log 1. Recasting Napier's description in the language of differential equations and x solving, it is possible to demonstrate that Nap. log x = 10 7 log 1 7 ; however, it is critical to 10\ne\nstress that Napier did not interpret his logarithms in anything approaching the modern sense of an exponent for some given base. It may be reassuring to us to solve a differential equation to obtain something more familiar, but Napier's vision clearly did not start there. From the top of the mountain, we can see that Napier's path and our more recent path of regarding logarithms as exponents clearly both get us to the top, but the paths themselves are very, very different. Napier regarded one of the essential properties of logarithms as \"the logarithms of similarly proportioned sines are equidifferent.\" (Napier, p. 23) In other words, for a given k, log (kx) log x = log (ky) log y. This can clearly be considered, in light of the laws of logarithms ky kx which Napier himself knew, as equivalent to log = log . In another interesting side x y note, Napier's proposition 51 states: \"All sines in the proportion of two to one have 6931469.22 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) This statement is closely related to the fact that the natural logarithm of 2 is .693147180. Henry Briggs (1561 1630) was an English mathematician and professor of geometry at Gresham House, London at the time he met Napier; he went on to become the first Savilian professor of geometry at Merton College, Oxford. After having read the Descriptio, he went to Edinburgh in 1615 to meet with Napier. It is somewhat unusual in scientific history, but the two men immediately hit it off and in fact worked with each other until Napier's death in 1617. In 1617 with the publication of Logarithmorum chilias prima and in 1624 with Arithmetica logarithmica Briggs implemented the changes in Napier's logarithmic scheme that he and Napier had considered. Quoting from the preface to the Arithmetica logarithmica: That these logarithms differ from those which that illustrious man, the Baron of Merchiston, must not surprise you...concerning that matter I wrote immediately to the author himself...I journeyed to Edinburgh, where, being most hospitably received by him, I lingered for a whole month. But as we talked over the change in the logarithms he said that he had for some time been of the same opinion and had wished to accomplish it; he had however published those he had already prepared until he could construct more convenient ones if his affairs and his health would admit of it. But he was of the opinion that the change should be effected in this manner, that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and 10000000000\n12\nthat of the whole sine; which I could not but admit was by far the most convenient. (NTV, p. 126) It seems clear that Napier had already begun to consider a more accessible approach to his logarithms, and that Briggs' suggestions helped moved him in that direction. (As Napier himself observed at the end of his table of logarithms in the Constructio: \"Nothing is perfect at birth.\" (Napier, p. 87.)) Since the logarithm of 1 becomes 0, this simplifies greatly the computational algorithms that Napier had already discovered, bringing them in line with our present theorems of logarithms. In the Constructio, an appendix was included \"On the Construction of another and better kind of Logarithms, namely one in which the Logarithm of unity is 0.\" In this, Napier suggested but in fact did not do a revision of his own system, reflecting what he and Briggs had already determined would make computations with logarithms easier. Napier also observed in the Constructio that in this case, \"if two numbers with known Logarithms be multiplied together, forming a third; the sum of their Logarithms will be the Logarithm of the third\" (Napier, p. 50) (in other words, when you multiply, you add) and went on to state all the other familiar laws of logarithms which we use. He went ahead and then observed \"whence the only difficulty is in finding the Logarithms of the prime numbers\" (Napier, p. 51). Briggs went ahead with his own work after Napier's death, and the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica contain what is for all intents and purposes the first table of common logarithms i.e., base 10 logarithms. One of the sections of this module discussed how to calculate logarithms somewhat in the method of Napier and Briggs. However, to get a sense of what they went through, consider the following. In constructing his tables, Napier started with the value of his radius 10,000,000 and began successive multiplications of that by 1-10 -7 ; in more modern terms, he generated the terms of a geometric sequence whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -7 . Moulton argues that in performing this process some 100 times, Napier became aware that decreasing a number by the same ratio each time was equivalent to repeatedly decreasing a line segment by the same proportional length, possibly giving rise to Napier's definition of a logarithm. It may have also been the case that through the sheer effort of this work, Napier eventually saw the utility of having (in modern terms) log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 1, but that he needed to go through the tremendous labor of the first construction to reach that conclusion. It is therefore tempting now to claim Napier must have therefore seen that he was constructing a system where the logarithm corresponded to the necessary power of 10 needed to obtain the given number, but that again is our view from the mountain, not Napier's. After working through the first 100 terms (his first table), Napier apparently became aware of the tremendous work left, so he changed to a geometric series whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -5 . He carried this out for 50 more terms, giving a second table. He then created two other series in a third table, one having ratio 1- 1/2000 and one having ratio 1 - 1/100. Using the data he had accumulated with his three tables, he was then able to calculate the logarithm values of numbers from 10 7 to almost exactly 5 x 10 6 . It is small wonder that Napier worked on his tables for 20 years before he published them! In the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs approached the problem differently. He began with log 10 = 1 and then began taking successive square roots, using well-known algorithms for the computations needed for the roots. (For\n13\nexample, if 10 = 3.162277, then log 3.162277 = .5.) Once Briggs obtained the logarithms of the primes, it was easy, using the laws of logarithms, to then generate the values of the logarithms of composite numbers. It may be somewhat astonishing to realize the work required by Briggs to obtain, in Arithmetica logarithmica, the logarithms of all natural numbers from 1 to 20,000 and 90,000 to 100,000, carried out to 14 places. (For example, in his calculations to obtain the logarithm of 2 he took 47 successive square roots.) Adriaan Vlacq a few years later completed Briggs' work and completed a table for all integers from 1 to 100,000 to 10 decimals places. (Until recently, these tables formed the basis of all modern logarithm tables.) Napier also used his idea to construct what were called \"Napier's bones\", a mechanical multiplication table. Within 7 years, William Oughtred used Napier's ideas to construct the first rectilinear slide rules, basically the first pocket calculator. Some two hundred years after Napier's publication, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace noted that \"by shortening the labors, (Napier) doubled the life of the astronomer.\" Logarithms also present one of the instances when a given discovery must have been in the air; it now seems clear that roughly at the same time Napier was working on his own logarithms, the same essential concept occurred to the Swiss astronomer and watchmaker Joost Brgi (1552 - 1632). While the exact timing of Brgi's work is not entirely clear, he may have in fact worked on the concept before Napier did; however, it is the case that he did not publish his own tables (actually, his were tables of anti-logarithms) until 1620 in Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen. Kepler's statement on the priority issue may be of some interest: \"...(this) led the way for Justus Byrgius to the very same logarithms many years before Napier's edition, although this man, a procrastinator and guardian of his secrets, abandoned his child at birth and did not rear it for publicity.\" (Goldstine, p. 22) Brgi generated the values in his own table by starting with 10 8 and then multiplying by 1 + 10 -4 to obtain the successive terms. The ease with which the discovery of logarithms supported the massive calculations needed for astronomy and navigation generated intense interest among mathematicians. The work of Gregory of St. Vincent and his student A. A. de Sarasa by 1647 made the connection between the natural logarithm of a number a and the area bounded by the x-axis, the vertical a 1 lines x = 1 and x = a (for any a > 0) and the curve y = 1/x, what we would now call dx . x 1 (Natural logarithms are contrasted with common, or Briggsian logarithms by their base. If we use Euler's interpretation of a logarithm as the exponent of a given base, then natural logarithms use the number e = 2.718281828... as their base, while common logarithms use 10.) The Danish mathematician Nicolaus Mercator is usually credited with discovering the formula for the x2 x3 x4 expansion of the natural logarithm of x + 1 as the power series x - + - +... by 1668. 2 3 4 As early as 1664 Newton used this same idea to compute the value of the natural logarithm of 1.1 to 68 decimal places. The ground-breaking work of Newton and Leibniz in the calculus quickly suggested applications of logarithms very far indeed from Napier's original view of the technique.\n14\nIt turned out that the method that was developed to help with computational drudgery held a vital key in the new mathematics of calculus. The logarithm took on a life of its own, separate from the astonishing levels of sheer, brute arithmetic that it both replaced and which were required to establish the first logarithm tables. The logarithm continued to play a major role in computational sciences, but it had already begun to move away from its roots. As the 18th century progressed, mathematicians became increasingly aware of the necessary changes which calculus had brought to the techniques available to them, and also to the changes which were needed in their more basic structures in order to give the methods of calculus a concrete logical base. One of the more central concepts which evolved was that of a `function', namely the ability to regard an operation as the pairing of the number which was to be operated on with the number which resulted from the operation itself. In more abstract terms, it allowed mathematicians to regard the operation as an object itself, more divorced from the immediate numerical relationships. For example, while mathematicians had worked with the numerical relationships expressed in 2 2 = 4, 2 3 = 8, and so forth, they could now consider the relationship between the variables x and y in y = 2 x . This is an example of an `exponential' function, where the variable is the exponent of some positive base. Leonhard Euler, the enormously influential mathematician of the later 18th century, formulated the relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions when he defined log a b = c to be the case if and only if a c = b; therefore, y = a x was equivalent to the statement x = log a y. This was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations. It has provided a gateway into the solutions and analysis of many types of problems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to solve otherwise. An important observation therefore can be made that despite the view of many, both in the past and in present times, mathematics is indeed a changing science. A method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings. Until fairly recently, high school students versed in math and science were given a significant exposure to the computational methods which logarithms opened up and the mechanical devices which logarithms helped create. With the advent of inexpensive hand-held calculators, the computational roots of logarithms have become obsolete, yet the concepts which logarithms have led to continue to be of great utility. We need to be cautious whenever we decide a particular method or approach has reached a dead end; the history of logarithms provides an excellent example of how mathematics grows and develops new relationships for what may appear to be concepts and techniques which have been outgrown, but which can continue to provide important mathematics. It is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined. Vistas open up which are almost unimaginable until you reach the peak, and not only the path up but the ground below takes on a very different appearance. You can marvel at the difficulties of some paths and the ease of others, but it is difficult to not appreciate the sheer\n15\neffort required along any path to make it to the top, and especially for those who pioneered a particular path. So too it is with the concepts and computations of logarithms; whether it be Napier, Brgi, Briggs, or any of the multitude who followed them, we must continue to remember and appreciate their contributions and exertions. Questions: 1. In Proposition 5 of the Constructio Napier writes \"In numbers distinguished thus by a period in their midst, whatever is written after the period is a fraction, the denominator of which is unity with as many cyphers after it as there are figures after the period.\" (Napier, p. 8) What exactly does this appear to refer to? 2. In Proposition 52 Napier states \"All sines in the proportion of ten to one will have 23025842.34 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) What exactly is Napier saying in modern terms? 3. In an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes \"Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c. [or division by 2, 3, & c.].\" (Napier, p. 51) Translate the meaning of this statement into more modern terms. 4. In 1617, Napier published the Rabdologi where he described the construction and use of what are now called `Napier's bones' or `Napier's rods'. Find out what these were and what they were used for.\n16\nJohn Napier\n17\nLesez Euler, lesez Euler, c'est notre maitre a tous. Read Euler, read Euler!

True, he was very busy and so refused flatly to give me private lessons; but he gave me much more valuable advice to start reading more difficult mathematical books on my own and to study them as diligently as I could; if I cam across some obstacle of difficulty, I was given permission to visit him freely every Saturday afternoon and he kindly explained to me everything I could not understand, which happened with such greatly desired advantage that whenever he had obviated one difficulty for me, because of that ten others disappeared right away, and this undoubtedly, is the best method to succeed in mathematical subjects.

The students may work in groups or individually. If the students need extra time to finish the problems, they could be assigned as homework. It is interesting to read the way that Newton introduced exponents and the terminology that he used. It is also interesting to note that this was part of a lecture Newton gave at Cambridge University - so your students are being exposed to the type of mathematics that was available to university students in the 1680's. An additional assignment would be to have the students write the complete passage in the background information using modern terminology.

If a is a quantity, \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means a a. There will be various answers to this. Hopefully most will find it sufficient. The solution to a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3 a2b4 = 42 x 34 = 4 4 3 3 x 3 3 = 1296 It means that the a is to multiplied together 3 times: a a a It means a a a. Since he is naming the powers, like a5 as cube-square, he is adding the powers. So a8 would be square-cube-cube or maybe square-square-square-square.\n3. 4. 5.\n24\nExponent Notation According to Newton Student Page\nHistorical Background In Sir Isaac Newton's widely read Arithmetica Universalis, many beginning algebraic topics are included. One such topic is that of exponents. This activity comes directly from one of Newton's Arithmetica Universalis, which is a collection of the material covered in his lectures at Cambridge University in England in the 1680's. The following excerpts are from the 1972 translation by D. T. Whiteside from Newton's original Latin. t From page 61: If a quantity should multiply itself, for shortness the number of factors is usually appended. Thus. Here note that a number written immediately between two variables relates always to the preceding one. Thus `3' in the quantity a3b2does not signify the b2 is to be taken 3 times, but denotes that a has twice to be multiplied into itself. Note also that these quantities are said to be of as many dimensions, powers or `dignities' as they comprise factors or quantities multiplying one another, and that the number appended is called the index of their power or dimension. Thus a2 is of two dimensions or powers, while a3, as its appended number `3' indicates is of three. Also a2 is said to be the square, a3 the cube, a4 the square-square (fourth power), a5 the square-cube (fifth power), a6 the cube-cube (sixth power), a7 the square-square-cube (seventh power) and so forth. Exercises 1. Explain what \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means. 2. Is the explanation Sir Isaac Newton gave his students in the following enough for you to write terms using exponents? Give your reasons why or why not. Would you be able to evaluate a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3? \"Thus.\" 3. According to Newton what does the `3' in the expression a3b2 mean? 4. What does the phrase \"a has twice to be multiplied into itself\" mean? 5. Using Newton's method of naming powers, how would he describe the eighth power of a, a8?\n25\nProperties of Exponential Functions Teacher Notes\nThis activity is a great way to give students the opportunity to graph and observe a variety of exponential functions and then summarize their findings.

Answers will vary, but will be similar to the ones in A through C above. Students might choose negative or zero values for a. If they do, this is a good time to discuss why these values give very strange graphs, graphs which we will usually avoid. In general, in precalculus and calculus classes we generally want to talk just about continuous functions and functions whose inverses are also functions. E. Answers will vary, but will include some of the following observations. All the graphs intersect at the point (0,1). None of the graphs has negative y-values. If a > 0, as z increases, y increases. As a gets larger, the values of y increase faster as z increases. If a < 1, as z increases, y decreases. If a = 1, then y = 1; i.e. the function is constant. If a < 0, the graph jumps back and forth between positive and negative values for y as z increases. F. Answers will vary. Many students will find that their answers include some, if not all, of Euler's observations.\n28\nProperties of Exponential Functions Student Pages\nLeonhard Euler wrote the first easy-to-read precalculus book in 1748. First, see how you might figure out properties of exponential functions; then compare your summary to his. Look at a general exponential function, y = a z , and see what happens to the graph as the value of a changes. Use the same scale for all graphs.

Compare what you have written with the description Euler writes concisely below.\n30\nEuler gives a magnificent and clear description of an exponential function in his precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite (1748). The values of the exponential a z depend primarily on the magnitude of the constant a . If a = 1 , then we always have a z = 1 , no matter what value is given z to z . If a > 1 , then a will have a greater value if the value of z is greater than it was originally and as z goes to infinity, so also a z increases to infinity. If z = 0 , then a z = 1 ; if z < 0 , then the values of a z become less than 1 and as z goes to z - , a goes to 0. On the other hand if a < 1 but still positive, then the values of a z decrease when z increases above 0. The exponential [ a z ] increases as z 1 increases in the negative direction. Since when a < 1 , we have < 1 , and if we a 1 -z z let = b , then a = b . For this reason we can examine the case when a < 1 a from the case when a > 1 .\n31\nProperties of Exponents Teacher Notes\nThis activity gives students the opportunity to look at how a master mathematician expressed several ideas about exponents in his great precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite, published in 1748.

Chuquet's secret is the same as our answer to 8e.\n33\nProperties of Exponents Student Pages\nWhat would happen if exponents were numbers other than natural numbers? Islamic mathematicians of the 11th century were the earliest people to use negative numbers as exponents. Nicole Oresme, a French mathematician associated with the University of Paris around 1350, had some ideas about fractional exponents and even tried to explain what it would mean to have an irrational number as an exponent. In 1655, John Wallis, an English mathematician, gave a clearer explanation of fractional exponents and a few years later, Isaac Newton was able to make use of them with ease. Here, however, we look at the explanation of exponents of various types by the prolific mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748: Let the exponential to be considered be a where a is a constant and the exponent z is a variable. Since the exponent z stands for all determined numbers, it is clear at least that all positive integers can be substituted for z to give determined 1 2 3 4 5 6 values for a , a , a , a , a , a , etc. If for z we substitute the negative integers -1, -2, -3, etc. we obtain\nz\n1 1 1 1 1 1 , , , , , , etc. If z = 0, a1 a2 a 3 a4 a5 a6 then we have a0 = 1. If we substitute a fraction for z , for instance 1 1 2 1 3 , , , , , etc., we obtain 2 3 3 4 4\nthe values more values, since the extraction of roots gives several values. However, we will consider only their primary [now called principal] values, since\n1 2 1 3 a, a 3 , a 3 , a 4 , a 4 , etc. These symbols can have two or\na a and 3 a ... In like manner we let z take irrational values, even though it is more 7 difficult to understand this concept. ... Thus a has a value which lies between 2 3 a and a ...\nfrom Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite by Leonhard Euler Some statements in that selection probably look more familiar than other statements. For example, in the first sentence Euler talks about negative exponents. In the second sentence he\n1 tells about square roots so that we understand a 2\nz\n5 2 lies between is to be thought of as a ... function. For this reason. a\n2\n= a\n1 and by implication, a 3\n= 3 a , etc.\nWe can use this to help us rewrite expressions with rational exponents as expressions with radicals instead. Complete the following using Euler's idea to rewrite the expressions using radicals.\n34\n2 1 1 2 3 = a 3 = a 2 3 = _________________ 1. a\n( )\n1 2. a 4\n= _________________\n3 3. a 4 =__________________= __________________=__________________\nThe sixth and seventh sentences refer to situations such as the fact that a given positive number has two different square roots, a positive one and a negative one. But since we want to define an exponential function, we will consider only the positive value.\n5 lies between the two 2 7 successive integers 2 and 3. Finally, Euler also suggest that one can estimate the value of a when one knows that 7 lies between the two successive integers 2 and 3.\nUse this method to estimate the following by stating the numbers between which the given number lies. Example. 4\n5 2 3 2 = _______________________________________________________________ 4. 4 2 3 = a number between 4 and 4 , that is, between 16 and 64.\n5 2 , since The next sentence suggests a method to estimate the value of a\n5. 2 6. 32\n5\n= ______________________________________________________________\n4 5 = ______________________________________________________________\n3 7. 9 2 = ________________________________________________________________\nClearly this last observation by Euler does not give very precise estimates, but it is insightful!\n8. Familiar, Yet Different, Yet Related. You are a mathematics historian; you even consider yourself a detective of sorts! As you read the selection below, think about these questions: What familiar concept is being discussed? The notation looks familiar, but wait, does it have the same meaning? Or is it a little different?\n35\nNicolas Chuquet, a mathematician who taught in Lyons, France, wrote these words sometime during the fifteenth century. He invented the notation, but its meaning has evolved somewhat since then. To understand the reason why denomination of number is added to denomination, ..., it is necessary to set down several proportional numbers beginning with 1 and arranged in a continuous sequence, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. or 3, 9, 27, etc. Numbers 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 Denomination 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nNow it is necessary to know that 1 represents and is in the place of numbers, whose denomination is 0, 2 represents [...] the first terms, whose denomination is 1. 4 holds the place of the second terms, whose denomination is 2. And 8 is in the place of the third terms, 16 holds the place of the fourth terms, 32 represents the fifth terms, and so for the others. Now whoever multiplies 1 by 1, it comes to 1, and because 1 multiplied by 1 does not change at all, neither does any other number when it is multiplied by 1 increase or diminish, and for this consideration, whoever multiplies a number by a number, it comes to a number, whose denomination is 0. And whoever adds 0 to 0 makes 0. Afterwards, whoever multiplies 2, which is the first number by 1, which is a number, the multiplication comes to 2; then afterwards, whoever adds their denominations, which are 0 and 1, it makes 1; thus the multiplication comes to 21. And from this it comes that when one multiplies numbers by first terms or vice versa, it comes to first terms. Also whoever multiplies 21 by 21, it comes to 4 which is a second number. Thus the multiplication amounts to 42. For 2 multiplied by 2 makes 4 when adding the\n36\ndenominations, that is 1 with 1, makes 2. And from this it comes that whoever multiplies first terms by first terms, it comes to second terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 21 by 42, it comes to 83. For 2 multiplied by 4 and 1 added with 2 makes 83. And thus whoever multiplies first terms by second terms, it comes to third terms. Also, whoever multiplies 42 by 42, it comes to 16 which is a fourth number, and for this reason whoever multiplies second terms by second terms, it comes to fourth terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 4 which is a second number by 8 which is a third number makes 32 which is a fifth number. And thus whoever multiplies second terms by third terms or vice versa, it comes to fifth terms. And third terms by fourth terms comes to 7th terms, and fourth terms by fourth terms, it comes to 8th terms, and so for the others. In this discussion there is manifest a secret which is in the proportional numbers. It is that whoever multiplies a proportional number by itself, it comes to the number of the double of its denomination, as, whoever multiplies 8 which is a third number by itself, it comes to 64 which is a sixth. And 16 which is a fourth number multiplied by itself should come to 256, which is an eighth. And whoever multiplies 128 which is the 7th proportional by 512 which is the 9th, it should come to 65536 which is the 16th. from N. Chuquet, pp. 144, 151-153 a.

Compound interest holds much promise for applying mathematical ideas to relatively important everyday applications, such as the amount of money an investor makes on a particular investment, a notion Americans are familiar with living in a capitalist society. The need to understand compound interest also arises in calculating the interest that accrues on credit card purchases, car, home, and boat loans, and financial investments. In the following activity, a historical example is used as a springboard to discuss compound interest. The historical context is centered on the European colonist's purchase of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Exposure to the compound interest formula is a prerequisite.) Objective: To investigate an application of exponential growth, compound interest, using an situation taken from the historical context of the Dutch \"purchase\" of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Materials: Student Page; Calculator; Graphing calculator and Internet access (optional) Time Frame: Two 45-minute class periods; extended project would be done outside of class How to Use: To begin the discussion of exponential growth and compound interest embedded in a historical context, provide students with the historical opener on an overhead transparency (see Transparency #1). Have students read and reflect on this historical situation. You might ask students to develop their own questions that arise from the historical situation presented. Be prepared to consider social and historical questions as well as mathematical related questions. A second option would be to use the guiding questions in the student activity to develop the lesson. One way to begin the lesson is to look at question 1 involving compound interest. First, it might be helpful to review the general compound interest formula. You might also show students the derivation for the general compound interest formula. It might be helpful to derive the compound interest formula using an example first. Then show the students the formal algebraic derivation for the compound interest formula. Consider the following example involving compound interest. You have $100. You want to invest your money in a fund that guarantees 8% interest compounded quarterly over six years. You have the following given information: r = 8% = 0.08 annual interest rate t=6 time in years\n38\nn=4 number of compounding periods per year nt = 24 number of compounding periods P = $100 principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods Because we are looking for the total amount of money at the end of 24 periods, we want to find S 24 . Guide the students through the derivation using the above given information. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is 0.08 S1 = 100 + 100 = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is 0.08 2 S 2 = S1 + S1 = S1 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02)(1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the third compounding period is 0.08 2 3 S3 = S 2 + S2 = S 2 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 Explain to your students that we are looking for S 24 ; that is, the total amount of money we have accumulated at the end of the 24th period. Next guide students to the algebraic derivation of the general compound interest. We have the following given information: r = annual interest rate t = time in years n = number of compounding periods per year nt = total number of compounding periods P = principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods r = interest rate per compounding period n nt = total number of compounding periods. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is r r S 1 = P + P = P 1 + n n\n39\nThe total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is r r r r r r r S 2 = S1 + S1 = P1 + + P1 + = P1 + 1 + = P1 + . n n n n n n n The total amount of money we have at the end of the nt -th compounding period is S nt = P1 + r . n\nnt 2\nUsing the derivation of the general compound interest formula, lead students to the exponential equation that describes the situation described in the historical opener. Let P = 24, r = 7%, n = 1 (compounded annually) and t = 372 (the number of years since 1626 this is being calculated for the year 1998) r y = S nt = P1 + n 0.07 y = 241 + 1\nnt\n(1)( 372 )\ny = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410\nGuide your students to discover that the initial formula for y represents an exponential growth function of the form, f ( x) = ab x where a is the initial amount of money, b is the growth factor, and x is the total number of compounding periods. Stress that because b > 1 in compound interest problems, then the function is an example of exponential growth. Guide students to change a and b in f(x) = abx to see the effect on the curve. Encourage students to examine the function for a > 0, a < 0, b >1, and 0 < b < 1 and to write a complete explanation of the results they found. Have students solve additional examples of exponential growth problems either using variations on the historical opener problem or problems from a textbook. Give students an opportunity to create their own problems and to explain them to the class.\n40\nCompound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase Solutions\n1. As indicated above, y = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410 2. The 3.8 billion dollars is less than the amount found in number 1, so perhaps, Minuit paid too much, or the interest rate is too high, or the tax assessment value is too low. 3. Minuit should have paid a great deal more. Land in the Old World was dear and certainly, an equivalent amount of land, in say Holland or England, would have been very expensive. But given that the amount found in number 1 is higher than the tax valuation in number 2, find a payment that would give the tax valuation. This time solve for the initial amount given that the final amount is 3.8 billion dollars and the interest rate is 7% with 372 years (this solution is being done in 1998) with annual compounding yields: 3.8 10 = a(1.07)\n9 372\n3.8 10 9 a= .044567 or about 4.5cents.

This famous mathematics book was written by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in the middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that this problem appears in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum shows that issues of population growth were of concern to the people living in the eighteenth century. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. However, this activity is designed to solve the problem using exponential functions first. Later, when logarithms and logarithmic functions are developed in the module, you can show students how to solve this problem using logarithms. Showing students how to solve this problem using both exponential and logarithmic functions provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the inherent connection between exponential and logarithmic functions. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objectives: To develop students' understanding of exponential growth functions by using a problem of population growth taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum, which was written in the middle eighteenth century.

It helps explain why a mathematical model may need to change with the passing decades. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry (Prerequisites: Using various regression equations on a graphing utility to describe data) Objective: To study various regression equations culminating in the need for the logistic equation to model real-world data Materials: Overhead projector; transparency made from the Population Data; Graphing calculators with regression equation capabilities, including the logistic function Time Frame: One class period How to Use: This activity works very well as a teacher-guided discussion with the everexpanding data set being modeled by successive functions. It helps the students see that as more and more data is available a model may need to change in order to make better predictions. 1. Perhaps begin by asking students which statistics about New York City might be valuable and why. Lead them to realize that population trends might prove useful in city planning in such areas as number and size of schools, sewage treatment and garbage collection, road construction and maintenance. 2. Using the historical information in the lesson discuss past efforts in history to solve similar prediction problems. 3. Ask students to look at the initial data set and imagine that they are city planners for NYC after the 1820 census and that they need to predict the population for the next few decades. Have them enter the data into lists on their calculators or computers, make a scatterplot of the data and fit an appropriate regression function to the data. Then have them predict the population for the next decade. 4. Ask students to pretend that a couple decades have passed and ask if their prediction was good for 1840. Now have them add this data to their previous lists, make another scatterplot incorporating all the data from 1790 through 1880, choose an appropriate regression function and predict the population for the next decade. Some students may try a quadratic regression function. It actually appears to fit the data better than the exponential function. You may want to tell them that fitting the data is not the only criterion for choosing a particular regression equation. For example, the quadratic function would imply that at first the population of NYC would decrease during the first decade under consideration. While that is\n54\npossible, it doesn't fit the real data that is ever increasing. They may point out that the exponential function overestimates the population in the final decade of this data set. That will point the way to needing a different regression function, a suspicion that is confirmed by the next data set. 5. For the third data set, after plotting additional points, students may suggest that it is composed of several parts, such as exponential for the first third, quadratic for the second third, and logarithmic for the final third. You can then suggest that this S-shape is characteristic of the logistic function and students may use their TI-83 graphing calculators to fit a regression function to the data. 6. For the final data set, after plotting the additional points, students may decide it is best described as a cubic function, but you may want to point out that a cubic equation would have predicted a negative population for the first three decades of the 1800's. 7. A discussion of possible reasons why the population growth rate slows down in the final set is a lively finale to this activity. Students may bring up such possibilities as population density, insufficient water/sewage treatment plants, insufficient medical services for a greater population, not enough roads or public transportation, not enough schools to support a greater population.

We will also consider the entire concept of using mathematics to model a real-world situation. An important use of mathematics is its ability to take current numerical information, or data, and then make predictions of future behavior based on that data. A useful field of investigation is that of population growth, with its obvious impact on city planning, environmental concerns, allocation of resources, and many other areas. Data from previous years can indicate important trends; social scientists, economists, and many other professionals have discovered that one can also use data to predict future growth patterns. We will use data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census on the population of New York City to investigate three different predictive models. One simple possibility for population growth is that the growth is constant; in other words, that the population grows by the same amount each year. The population can then be depicted mathematically with an \"arithmetic\" sequence, a sequence of numbers where any two successive terms differ by the same amount. An example of an arithmetic sequence is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17... A more complicated model uses the premise that the growth is proportional to the present population; in other words, the larger the population, the more people are added each year. In this situation, we often say that the growth rate, say r%, is constant. The population in this case can be represented by a \"geometric\" sequence, one where any two successive terms have the same ratio. An example of a geometric sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... A third model uses the idea that the growth of the population will be proportional to two factors: the current population and also how close the population gets to some ceiling or maximal size. This model implies that initial growth may be faster, but as the constraints of resources come into play, then the growth will slow down. The full mathematical development of these three models requires techniques of calculus, and therefore we will not dwell unnecessarily on the methods used to obtain the equations. However, we can briefly summarize the central mathematical conclusions. In the first model the population y will be a linear function of time t, that is, the population y will be given by the familiar formula y = mt + b. The second model results in an exponential model of growth, in which the population y is expressed by y = y 0 e rt where y 0 is some given initial value, r is the rate, t is the time and e is the familiar 2.718... The third model results in the logistic model of c , where for the additional variables, c represents the maximal population growth, y = 1 + ae ( - bt ) which can be sustained (called the \"carrying capacity\") and a and b are constants which emerge from a particular set of data.\n56\nLet's consider the use of these three models with the same overall set of data, restricted to different time periods. The U. S. Bureau of the Census contains a myriad of information about populations of various segments of the United States from 1790 until the present. (The Constitution of the United States orders that a count of the population be held every 10 years in order to correctly apportion the seats in the House of Representatives; this raw data can then be used in variety of ways to gain interesting information about patterns of growth in the U. S.) One such set of information is the population of New York City as measured every 10 years in the Census. For the period of 1790 to 1820, the Census gives the following counts: Year Population 1790 33,131 1800 60,515 1810 96,373 1820 123,706\nUsing your graphing calculator, plot those four points using the Year as the x-coordinate and the Population as the y-coordinate and a suitable viewing rectangle; you should obtain something which resembles Chart 1. It should be pretty clear that these four data points look like they almost fall on a line; you can use the capabilities of your particular calculator to discover the regression equation line which will fit the data which gives you an answer of y = 3075.83x 5,473,441.9. Graph that equation over the set of data to observe how good a fit it is. However, you test a model by not only how well it fits given data but also how well it will predict the future. The count for 1830 was 202,589, and the count for 1840 was 312,710. According to the equation above you should expect the count for 1830 to be 155,327 and the count for 1840 to be 186,085; clearly, the mathematical model is at odds with the real data. The linear model does not account for the complexity of the information and significantly undercounts the real population. Let's consider more of the set of data next; to the data given above for 1790 to 1820, expand the data set to include the following through 1880: Year Pop. 1830 202,589 1840 312,710 1850 515,547 1860 813,669 1870 942,292 1880 1,206,299\nGraphing these in a suitable viewing rectangle should yield something resembling Chart 2. This graph should look like the graph of an exponential function, examples of which you have already seen. You can again use the capabilities of your calculator to obtain an exponential function that fits the data, yielding y = (11162 10 -27 )e .040578 x . Graph that function over the data set, and . again note the fit. Using our previous approach, the census count for 1890 was 1,515,301 and the count for 1900 was 3,437,202; our equation predicts that the figure for 1890 should be 2,265,258 and for 1900 it should be 3,398.969. The exponential equation fits the given data well, but again it is less useful when we try to expand it to cover a broader scope. Now we will consider more data; we expand the data set to include the population through 1950:\n57\n1890 1,515,301\n1900 3,437,202\n1910 4,766,883\n1920 5,620,048\n1930 6,930,446\n1940 7,454,995\n1950 7,891,957\nGraph the population from 1790 through 1950, and note how the graph initially increases very rapidly, but then levels off and increases much more slowly. Compare your graph to Chart 3. This `S' shape is highly suggestive of the model of logistic growth. If your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y = . Again, map this function 1 + (12224 10 50 )e ( -.060438 x ) . over the data set, and observe the fit. To get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it. Notice how the curve flattens out. What is the implication of such a graph? Now, let's consider the full range of data through the 1990 census. Include in your data the following: Year Population 1960 7,781,984 1970 7,894,862 1980 7,071,639 1990 7,322,564\nThe graph of the full set of data is in Chart 4; make sure your graph is similar. Note the strong fit of the curve through the data of 1950, and then how the curve fails to model the data, particularly in 1980 and 1990. Some conclusions: The first matter for us to consider here is the history of some of these models. The simplest concept of growth is one that results in an arithmetic pattern; early scientific consideration of population growth of crops and domesticated animals demonstrated this model was not sufficient to explain the observed growth. Thomas Malthus (1766 1834) was an English clergyman and political economist who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. In there, he wrote that \"population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio.\" When this idea was investigated mathematically, it resulted in the exponential model expressed above. Pierre Francois Verhulst (1804 1849) was a Belgian mathematician and statistician who is credited with first writing about the logistic model of growth in 1845, when he attempted to take into account factors, such as limited resources, that would also tend to slow down growth after time. (Our logistic equation is written in the form y = f(t); Verhulst wrote it in the form t = h(y). This form requires the use of logarithms, and apparently he coined the word `logistic' to suggest the connection between the curve and the characteristic shape of a logarithm.) Next, we need to consider the whole concept of a model in and of itself. First, one point is to recognize that while a mathematical model may fit a particular set of data, it is a somewhat dangerous perspective to feel that the model will always work. We considered three models linear, exponential, and then logistic which did a reasonable job with one set of data, but then became less accurate as the data encompassed a larger time frame. There is a danger in assuming that we can ever exactly describe a living situation with a mathematical model. There are\n58\ntechniques of chaos theory that we could call on to account for the fluctuations in the data we considered in the periods of time following 1950, but what is to say that the future data will fit this model as well? It may be that all we can ever hope for is a rough description of a living entity without ever attaining any sort of permanent exactness. Second, mathematics expands to generate more sophisticated techniques as more data is made available. Malthus had a reasonable perspective, given his time; Verhulst developed a better one, but not necessarily because he was somehow smarter he had access to more information. Complicated models require equally complicated mathematics even to obtain approximate correlation with real-world data. We can even incorporate the new field of chaos theory to further refine our model. Third, we need to be careful about assuming that just because we can describe a set of data mathematically, we have somehow discovered what is creating the data. The Americans Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed independently rediscovered Verhulst's analysis of population growth in 1920. They cautioned: \"No process of empirically graduating raw data with a curve can in and of itself demonstrate the fundamental law which causes the occurring change.\" In other words, do not mistake an ability to describe a set of data with a mathematical formula with understanding what is creating the data itself. It may be that the mathematics helps us to see some underlying principles, but the ability to extrapolate the future from a set of data is at best an inexact procedure. However, in the article which they wrote to discuss the mathematics of logistic growth and its application to population modeling, Reed and Pearl concluded: \"...the hypothesis here advanced as to the law of population growth [that of logistic growth]...so closely describes the known facts regarding the past history of that growth, as to make it potentially profitable to continue the mathematical development and refinement of the hypothesis further.\" It may still be very useful for us to study the particular model, realizing that we still do not have a full mathematical description of the phenomena being studied. In an article appearing in the March, 1998 edition of the journal Primus on the logistic curve, Bonnie Shulman warns that while the difference between the mathematics of a model and the underlying dynamics may be clear to mathematicians, \"important policy decisions are made based on the predictions arising from models.\" It is perfectly understandable that we would use mathematical models to try to predict the future, but those predictions must always be taken with a sense of caution. Biologists have studied population growth of various species extensively, and as such have repeatedly come across examples of logistic growth. Even at that, in Population Biology of Plants, John L. Harper states: \"The logistic curve remains central to population biology, not because it describes how populations behave but rather because it provides a standard base of ideal behavior against which the reality can be judged and measured.\" (Harper, p. 3.)\n59\nChart 1:\n150000 100000 50000 0 1790 1795 1800\n1790-1820\n1805 year\n1810\n1815\n1820 Series1\nChart 2:\n1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 600000 400000 200000 0 1780 1790 1800 1810 1820\n1790-1880\nSeries1\n1830 year\n1840\n1850\n1860\n1870\n1880\nChart 3:\n8000000 7000000 6000000 5000000 4000000 3000000 2000000 1000000 0 1750 1800\n1790-1950\nSeries1\n1850 year\n1900\n1950\n60\n1790 1800 1810 1820 1830 1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920\n33131 60515 96373 123706 202589 312710 515547 813669 942292 1206299 1515301 3437212 4766883 5620084\n61\nNewton's Law of Cooling Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: In this activity students read a little history behind Newton's Law of Cooling as well as using it. An experiment using the CBL to collect data and then mathematics to analyze it could be incorporated here as well; many books, such as the Texas Instruments book by Chris Brueningsen relating mathematics and science using the CBL collection device, are available. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exponential and logarithmic functions; Solving exponential and logarithmic equations; Best fit curves (optional) Objective: The goal of this activity is to give students an opportunity to learn the history behind Newton's Law of Cooling and then to use this law in several exercises. Materials: Graphing calculator; Internet access (optional) Time Frame: This activity can be completed in one class period with the exercises started in the class, the rest to be assigned as homework. The amount of time needed for this activity may be decreased or increased depending on the mathematical level of your students. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss the history of Newton's Law of Cooling with the class after the students have had time to read the information. It might be necessary to do several examples of solving exponential and logarithmic equations before assigning this activity. If additional activities are desired, the teacher should visit the cited websites (or others that may be available) to determine the appropriateness for his/her class. Additionally, if the teacher decides to run an experiment using CBL equipment, there would need to be additional preparation on the part of the teacher. Bibliography: 1. Edwards, G. H. and David E.

If we substitute into the previous formula, we get C = 50 (1 2 ) 3 5 .2 9 17\nThis value is lower than the 37 C that we use. c. Again, substituting the given value for N gives us 50 C= (71) 208.82 17 Newton's value is lower than the actual value. d. There are several possible explanations. One is that Newton's values were approximations; another is that the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures is not linear. A suggested additional activity would be to use the three points (0,0), (12, 37) and (34, 100) in a different model a best fit line or a quadratic equation, for example. And then see how the new model works with the melting point of tin.\n64\nNewton's Law of Cooling Student Pages\nHistory\nBesides discovering calculus, Newton experimented in chemistry and alchemy. One of the Newton results discovered is what is now called Newton's Law of Cooling. He wrote anonymously \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\" in the 1701 volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Due to Newton's fame, Roger Cotes easily deduced that Newton was the author of the anonymous paper. Using a linseed oil thermometer, because linseed oil has a high boiling point of 240 C, Newton studied the melting points of various metals and alloys. Newton devised a method for measuring temperatures of up to 1000 C. his law of cooling. Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate at which the temperature T(t) changes in a cooling body is proportional to the difference between the temperature in the body and constant temperature Tm of the surrounding medium. If one writes this statement as a differential equation and solves, one gets Newton's Law of Cooling in the form T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)ekt where T0 is the initial temperature of the heated body at time t = 0 and where k is a constant which depends on the item being cooled. Notice that this equation is an example of exponential decay decay since k turns out to be negative because the body's temperature is decreasing.\n65\nExercises: 1. When a cake is removed from the oven, it is 340. One hour later, it has cooled to 100. If the temperature of the room is 70, a. find the constant k in Newton's Law of Cooling; b. find how long will it take for the cake to cool to 80? 2. Suppose the constant k Newton's Law of Cooling -0.05. If the temperature of a cup of coffee is 200 when it is poured and 150 10 minutes later, how warm is the room? 3. According to Newton's paper, \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\", he chose the following temperatures using his linseed oil thermometer: the freezing temperature of water was 0 and the boiling point of water was 34. The Celsius temperature for the freezing of water is 0 and the boiling point of water is 100. a. Find the linear equation that represents the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures. Let the linseed oil temperatures be the independent variable. b. Newton said that body temperature using his linseed oil thermometer was 12. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for body temperature. How does this compare with the 37 C that we use? c. Newton found that the melting point of tin was 71. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for the melting point of tin. According to the Smithsonian Physical Tables, the melting point of tin is 232 C. How does this compare with Newton's value? d. From the two examples you just did, how would you explain the discrepancies between the linseed oil thermometer values that Newton obtained, and the Celsius values that we use?\n66\nEuler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: This activity highlights a mathematical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum of 1748.

Materials: Student Pages; Calculator; Graphing calculator (optional) Time Frame: One 45-minute class period How to Use: Consider using cooperative groups to do this activity. At the very least, consider pairing up students to work on this activity. If students have not had much work with exponential functions, you might need to help them find the Have students consider the following historical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's highly influential pre-calculus book, Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, written in 1748: If the progression 2, 4, 16, 256, ... is formed by letting each term be the square of the preceding term, find the value of the twenty-fifth term. This example comes from Chapter VI: On Exponentials and Logarithms of Euler's book.. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. We simply want to graph the curve that models this progression. It is preferable to have students graph this curve using a graphing calculator. If there is no access to graphing calculators, have students make a table of values and graph the exponential function on graph paper. A suggested window for graphing is x: (0, 10) and y: (0, 300). Students must first determine the function that models this progression. The students should arrive at\ny = f ( x) = 2 2 .\nx\n67\nA sample table the students may make is as follows:\nx 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7At this time, students should find the twenty-fifth term is\n) f (25 = 22 = 216,777,216.\nStudents will quickly discover this expression cannot be evaluated on a calculator. It is important to stress that Euler solved the problem using logarithms--a topic that will be discussed later and connected with exponential functions. This example is a prelude to logarithmic functions--the inverse of exponential functions. Once the students have discovered the function and curve that modeled Euler's original problem, you can discuss the relationship between this function and the standard exponential function\n24\ny = f ( x) = 2 x.\nThen have the students make a comparison between the two functions. Note: Euler's original solution with logarithms to this example is provided (See Logarithmic Functions: Euler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Revisited). Later in the unit when you introduce logarithms, it would be appropriate to revisit this problem and show students its connection to logarithms and Euler's logarithmic solution. This will make students aware of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard, translated. by John D. Blanton.

Level: Precalculus. A prerequisite is the Binomial Theorem and the calculation of e as in the section \"What Will Happen If...\" Objective: To show how to calculate the power series for ex Time Frame: One or two class periods, with a homework assignment at the end. How to Use: This is a teacher-directed lesson. The Student Pages should be given to the students, but the teacher will need to present this material and answer questions about it.\n73\nCalculating ex Student Pages\nWe present here a method of calculating ex by means of a power series, a polynomial of \"infinite degree.\" We first recall the Binomial Theorem: (a + b) n = a n + na n -1b + n(n - 1) n- 2 2 n(n - 1)n - 2) n -3 3 a b + a b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nYou should make up several examples of this for practice. In particular, note that the formula is somewhat simpler when a = 1. We then have (1 + b) n = 1 + nb + n(n - 1) 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2) 3 b + b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nNext, recall the result, discussed in an earlier section of this module, that e can be found by considering the expression 1 1 + n\nn\nand letting n get larger and larger. Today, we generally write this as 1 e = lim 1 + . n n This means simply that as we let n get larger and larger, the given expression gets closer and closer to a particular number, which we have called e. Euler, however, writing before the notion of limit had been explained, would simply write 1 e = 1 + , n where n is an infinitely large number. Today, we do not generally use such concepts, and probably Euler himself knew that such numbers did not really exist. But what he meant by the phrase \"infinitely large number\" was simply a very very very large number; he used his intuition then to determine what properties such very very very large numbers would have. We will see some of these properties as we work through his argument.\nn n\n74\n1 Since e = 1 + , where n is infinitely large, we can also calculate e r . First, we note n that if n is infinitely large and r is a finite quantity, then n/r is also infinitely large. We can therefore rewrite e as 1 e = 1 + n/r It follows that\nn/r 1 . e = 1 + n / r r r n/r\nn\n.\nBy one of the basic rules for exponents, we can rewrite this in the form 1 e = 1 + . n/r\nr n\nBut we know that\n1 r = .. We therefore have, finally, n/r n r er = 1 + , n\nn\nagain where n is infinitely large. r . Of n course, we know that the binomial theorem is only valid for finite values of n, but we will assume that it is also true when n is infinitely large. After all, we are thinking of such values n simply as very very very large positive integers. However, since we do not know how large n actually is, we will only calculate the first few terms of the binomial expansion and use dots to indicate that this expression simply goes on for a long long time. Technically, this \"infinite polynomial\" is called a power series. We now apply the binomial theorem to this last expression, taking a = 1 and b = We get\n75\nr e = 1 + n\nr\nn\nr n(n - 1) r n(n - 1)(n - 2) r n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) r = 1+ n + + + + 1 2 n 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 n n n = 1+ r + n(n - 1)r 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2)r 3 n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)r 4 + + + 1 2n 2 1 2 3n3 1 2 3 4n 4\n2\n3\n4\nWe want to simplify the various terms of this expression. So we have to use a property of ``infinitely large numbers.'' In particular, we note that if n is infinitely large, subtracting 1 n -1 from n will have no appreciable result. Thus = 1 . Similarly, if we subtract 2 or 3 or indeed n any finite number from n, this will not really change that infinitely large number. We therefore n-k = 1 for any finite number k. What this means, then, is that in the expression above, have n the quantities n, n 1, n 2, n 3, ... in the numerators always \"cancel\" the factors of n in the denominators. It follows that our expression reduces to er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ( k - 1) k is usually called\nYou may know that if k is any integer, the expression 1 2 3\nr\nk factorial and is written k! Thus, our expression for e , usually called its power series expansion, is written as er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 2! 3! 4!\nThe value of the power series expansion for Euler was that it enabled him to calculate values for e r . In particular, he could calculate the value for e1 = e . We can do it as well, by substituting r = 1 into the series. We get e = 1+1+ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + + + + 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = 1+1+ + + + + + + + 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.166666667 + 0.041666667 + 0.008333333 + 0.001388889 + 0.000198413 + 0.000024802 + 2.718278771 2.71828\n76\nYour calculator can, of course, calculate e as well as e r , for any r in a fraction of a second. You may wonder how it does it. Although different calculators use different procedures for doing this, one of the ways your calculator may work is, in fact, by using the series for e r ,. Your calculator is basically hard-wired to perform additions and multiplications; since calculating with a power series just involves these operations, all that has to happen is that the calculator must perform very many of these operations very quickly. And that is precisely what it can do. Although a normal graphing calculator can probably only calculate e to 10 decimal places, it has been calculated to far more places by a computer. The first 100 decimal places are as follows: e 2.71828 18284 59045 23535 02874 71352 66249 77572 47093 69995 95749 66967 62772 40766 30353 54759 45713 82178 52516 64274 Like another important number , the number e is irrational and even transcendental. The first statement was proved by Euler in 1737. That e is transcendental, that is, that it cannot be a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, was proved in 1873 by Charles Hermite. Interestingly, these two important numbers are closely related, as we will see in the next activity. Exercises: 1. Use your calculator to determine the decimal form of the next three terms in the series for e, namely, 1/9, 1/10, and 1/11. Add these values to the value already calculated and check that you now have e calculated correctly to 8 decimal places. 2. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1. Namely, replace r by 0.1 in that series and evaluate using your calculator. Check that using the terms through the fifth power term gives you accuracy to 8 decimal places. 3. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. 4. Use the power series for e r to calculate e1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. How many terms do you need to use to get e1 to 8-place accuracy?\n77\nEquations using e Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: Students are intrigued by e and want to know more about where it is used.

Many students will answer parabola. 2. e is the basis of natural logarithms and is used in many real-life applications, such as population growth or radioactive decay. i is the -1 which is used for complex numbers and in many real-life applications, such as electricity. is used, for example, in the area formula for a circle and volume formulas for cylinders, cones and circles. 1 is the identity element for multiplication, just to name one reason it is special. 0 is a place holder, just to name one reason it is special.\n79\nEquations using e Student Pages\n1. Hanging link chains and two brothers Imagine a chain made of identical links, hanging from the two endpoints. You've probably seen such a curve as a barrier around a grassy plot or the wire suspended from telephone poles along a highway. Sketch below the shape of the curve formed by the chain. What shape does the curve look like? ________________________________\nYou are not alone in thinking about this. Over three hundred years ago two brothers of the famous Bernoulli family of mathematicians tried to figure out the equation that described it. In May, 1691, Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem in a scientific journal, Acta Eruditorum. A year later his younger brother Johann as well as two other famous mathematicians, Christian Huygens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, correctly solved this problem. In fact Jakob Bernoulli was not able to solve it; he and his brother Johann had a strong rivalry as shown in this letter from Johann to a friend. \"You say that my brother proposed this problem; that is true, but does it follow that he had a solution of it then? Not at all. When he proposed this problem at my suggestion (for I was the first to think of it), neither the one nor the other of us was able to solve it; we despaired of it as insoluble, until Mr. Leibniz gave notice to the public in the Leipzig journal of 1690, p. 360, that he had solved the problem but did not publish his solution, so as to give time to other analysts, and it was this that encouraged us, my brother and me, to apply ourselves afresh. The efforts of my brother were without success; for my part, I was more fortunate, for I found the skill (I say it without boasting, why should I conceal the truth?) to solve it in full.... The next morning, filled with Joy, I ran to my brother, who was still struggling miserably with this Gordian knot without getting anywhere, always thinking like Galileo that the catenary was a parabola. Stop! Stop! I say to him, don't torture yourself anymore to try to prove the identity of the catenary with the parabola, since it is entirely false.\" quoted from e the Story of a Number, p. 141 Actually this curve is called a catenary from the Latin word catena meaning chain. The equation e ax + e - ax that describes the catenary is y = where a is a constant that is determined by the 2a density of the chain and the tension as it is held. Calculus is required to prove that this is correct.\n80\n2. The Most Beautiful Equation\ne i + 1 = 0\nMany consider this to be one of the most beautiful equations ever discovered since it incorporates five of the special numbers of mathematics. It was discovered by Leonhard Euler, a mathematician who studied and contributed to many different branches of mathematics. Why is each of the five numbers special in mathematics?\ne _______________________________________________________________ i _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________\n1________________________________________________________________ 0________________________________________________________________ To Benjamin Pierce, one of Harvard's leading mathematicians in the nineteenth century, this formula of Euler came as something of a revelation. Having discovered it one day, he turned to his students and said: \"Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means. But we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.\" (Kasner and Newman, pp. 103-104)\n81\nIntroduction to Logarithms Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry properties of exponents) (Prerequisites: Properties of logarithms,\nObjective: To use original sources dealing with logarithms Materials: Transparency of Napier's justification for logarithms.

In these paragraphs, Euler introduces all the information about logarithms that we usually cover in our modern day courses - in two pages! Be sure to find out if the students think that this is a sufficient amount of explanation for understanding. In the student Activity that follows, the students will read and then do examples demonstrating Euler's explanations on logarithms. It would be good after the students finish the activity to point out that there probably is enough information about logarithms here for mastering the basics of logarithmic functions. You may want to use each separate paragraph of the Student Activity on different days, depending on your planned lesson, or the whole Student Activity after you have completed logarithms. Euler uses \"log n\" to mean \"log base a of n.\" Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard. Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite Book1. Translated by John D. Blanton. Springer Verlag, 1988\n82\nSeeing John Napier, A Description of the Admirable Table of Logarithms, 1616\n83\nIntroduction to Logarithms Solutions\nPart 1 1. If az = y, then z = log y. 2. Yes 3. \"a\" is the base of the logarithm and it must be a number greater than 1. 4. The domain is positive real numbers, if the logarithm is to be real also. Part 2 5. If y = 1 in az = y, then az = 1 which implies that z = 0. But a0 = 1 corresponds to loga 1 = 0. 6. By definition, a1 = a loga a= 1, a2 = a2 loga a2 = 2, ..., an = an loga an = n 7. Since a is a positive number, 1/a, 1/a2, ... will also be positive. 1/a, 1/a2,...are less than one since the reciprocal of a positive number greater than one is a positive number less than one. (There are other explanations.) loga 1/a = loga a-1 and by the definition of logarithms, loga a-1 = y ay = a-1. Therefore, y = -1 = loga a-1. The same argument holds for the other logarithms. Part 3 8. Power rule: log yn = nz Product rule: log vy = x + y = log v + log y Quotient rule: log (y/v) = z x = log y log v 9. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. vy = axaz = ax+z so log vy = x + y. It follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. 10. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. v/y = ax /az = ax-z so log v/y = x - y. It follows that log v/y = x - y = log v - log y. Hence, the logarithm of the quotient of two numbers is equal to the difference of the logarithms of the factors.\n84\n11. If you know the logarithm of 2 and the logarithm of 3, you know the logarithms of 6 = (2)(3), 9 = 32, 27 = 33,... , 4 = 22, 8 = 23, ..., 1.5 = 3/2, 2/3, ... 36 = 2232,...and an infinite number of other examples using just these two values. See the Student Activity Calculation of Logarithms - Using the Method of Napier and Briggs for more examples. Part 4 12. The only way for the value of a logarithm to be rational is if the number is a power of the base. There are many examples: log4 8 = 3/2 (since 8 = 43/2, i.e. 8 is a power of the base 4). 13. A surd is the square root of a number that is not a perfect square such as 2 , 5 , 7 ,...\n14 Part 5 15. The rule usually looks like this: log a n = 16. loga n = p ap = n logb n = q bq = n log10 n log10 a ap = bq a = bq/p\nSince b, p and q are all constant, a is also a constant and this value has nothing to do with n, the number whose logarithm we are evaluating. 17. Looking for log2 n = q, log10 n = p (we would know this value, since it is a base 10 logarithm) log102 = 0.3010300, also log2 2 = 1 Then p/q= 0.3010300 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277p. So, if every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2. Note that this is equivalent to the usual method you gave in number 15: log10 n log10 n = = (3.3219277) log10 n log 2 n = log10 2 .3010300\n85\nIntroduction to Logarithms Student Pages\nPart 1 Read paragraph 102.

On Exponentials and Logarithms\n102. Just as, given a number a, for any value of z, we can find the value of y [= az], so, in turn, given a positive value for y, we would like to give a value for z, such that az = y. This value of z, insofar as it is viewed as a function of y, it is called the LOGARITHM of y. The discussion about logarithms supposes that there is some fixed constant to be substituted for a, and this number is the base for the logarithm. Having assumed this base, we say the logarithm of y is the exponent in the power az such that az = y. It has been customary to designate the logarithm of y by the symbol log y. If az = y, then z = log y. From this we understand that the base of the logarithms, although it depends on our choice, still it should be a number greater than 1. Furthermore, it is only of positive numbers that we can represent the logarithm with a real number. 103. Whatever logarithmic base we choose we always have log1 = 0, since in the equation az = y, which corresponds to z = log y, when we let y = 1 we have z = 0. From this it follows that the logarithm of a number greater than 1 will be positive, depending on the base a. Thus log a = 1, log a2 = 2, log a3 = 3, log a4 = 4, etc. and, after the fact, we know what base has been chosen, that is the number whose logarithm is equal to 1 is the logarithmic base. The logarithm of a positive number less than 1 will be negative. Notice that log 1/a = -1, log 1/a2 = -2, log 1/a3 = -3, etc., but the logarithms of negative numbers will not be real, but complex, as we have already noted. 104. In like manner if log y = z, then log y2 = 2z, log y3 = 3z, etc., and in general log yn = nz or log yn = n log y, since z = log y. If follows that the logarithm of any power of y is equal to the product of the exponent and the logarithm of y. For example logy = (z) = (log y), log1/y = log y-1/2 = -(log y), and so forth. It follows that if we know the logarithms of any number, we can find the logarithms of any power of that number. If we already know the logarithms of two numbers, for example log y = z and log v = x, since y = az and v = ax, it follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. In like manner log (y/v) = z x = log y log v, that is, the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished by the logarithm of the denominator. These rules can be used to find the logarithms of many numbers from a knowledge of the logarithms of a few. 105. From what we have seen, it follows that the logarithm of a number will not be a rational number unless the given number is a power of the base a. That is, unless the number b is a power of the base a, the logarithm of b cannot be expressed as a rational number. In case b is a power of the base a, then the logarithm of b cannot be an irrational number. If, indeed, log b =\n90\nn, then an = b, but this is impossible if both a and b are rational. It is especially desirable to know the logarithms of rational numbers, since from these it is possible to find the logarithms of fractions and also surds 107. There are as many different systems of logarithms as there are different numbers which can be taken as the base a. It follows that there are an infinite number of systems of logarithms. Given two different systems of logarithms, there is a constant which relates the logarithms of the same number. If. If the logarithms of all numbers have been computed in one system, then it is an easy task, by means of this golden rule for logarithms, to find the logarithms in any other system. For example, we have logarithms for the base 10. From these we can find the logarithms with any other base, for instance the base 2. We look for the logarithm of a number n for base 2, which will be q, while the logarithm with base 10 of the same number n will be p. Since for base 10, log 2 = 0.3010300 and for base 2, log 2 = 1, then p/q = 0.3010300/1 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277. If every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2.\n91\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: The students should be familiar with the properties of logarithms and exponents and have at least an intuitive understanding of sequences.) Objective: In this activity, the students will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. Materials/Resources: Student Pages for each student; calculator (optional) Time Frame: This entire activity will probably take the equivalent of three class periods, with part of the activity sheet assigned as homework. Part 4 is the most difficult part and may be omitted if necessary. How to Use: An important thing to keep in mind as you work through this is that John Napier, the inventor of logarithms, was looking for a tool that would simplify complex mathematical calculations which were done laboriously by hand. In this project, you will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. This is an easy-to-follow activity that provides an excellent development of the meaning of logarithms. The teacher may need to do some of the exercises as guided practice to provide a direction for student answers.

S2: 2 4 8 16 32 S2: 21 22 23 24 25 64 128 26 27 256 28 512 29 1024 210 2048 211 4096 212 8192 213\nThe sequence S1 gives the power of 2 for the number in S2. 2. (8)(32) = 256 (512)(16) = 2924 = 213 = 8192 (128)( 4) = 2722 = 29 = 512\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe product is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the product of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 3. 8 in S2 corresponds to 3 in S1; 32 in S2 corresponds to 5 in S1; the product 256 corresponds to 8 = 3 + 5 in S1. In the second example, 512 corresponds to 9, 16 corresponds to 4, and the product, 8192, corresponds to 13 = 9 + 4. In the third example, 128 corresponds to 7, 4 corresponds to 2, and the product, 512, corresponds to 7 + 2 = 9. When multiplying the elements of S2, the product will always be an element of S2. This is because 2n2m = 2n+m. In words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. 32/8 = 25/23 = 25-3 = 22 = 8 512/16 = 29/24 = 29-4 = 25= 32 128/4 = 27/22 = 27-2 = 25= 32\n4. 5.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe quotient is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the quotient of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 6. Any two terms in S2 can be divided by considering the exponents, that is, the corresponding numbers in S1, subtracting these numbers, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. 322= (25)2 = 210 = 1026 84 = (23)4 = 212 = 4096 163 = (24)3 = 212 = 4096\n7.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe power of a term in S2 is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the power of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2.\n93\n8.\nAny term in S2 can be raised to a power by finding its exponent, that is, the corresponding number in S1, multiplying this number by the power, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. The easiest way would be to rewrite the number or numbers in S2 as powers of 2 and use the rules of exponents to evaluate the answer. When multiplying the numbers, add the exponents; when dividing the numbers, subtract the exponents; when raising to a power, multiply the exponent by the power.\n9.\nPart 2 Extending the Results 10. Yes the results from part 1 hold here also. The rules of exponents hold no matter what the base is. Let u = bn and v = bm in each of the following: L(u) + L(v) = L(bn) + L(bm) =n+m = L(bn+m ) = L(bn bm ) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(bn)/L(bm) = n/m = L(bn/m ) = L(bn /bm ) = L(u/v) L(uk) = L((bn)k) = L(bnk) = nk definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u rules of exponents definition of the function l\n11.\n94\n= k L(bn ) = k L(u)\ndefinition of the function l definition of u\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier 12. If we read sequence S3 from right to left, each number is 1 smaller than the one to its right. Thus we can extend it to the left by putting 0 to the left of 1 and then the negative integers to the left of 0. If we read sequence S4 from right to left, we see that each number comes from the one to its right by dividing by b. Since the number in S4 under 1 is b, the number to be put under 0 must be b/b = 1. Similarly, the number to be put under -1 must be 1/b. The number under -2 is then (1/b)/b = 1/b2, and so on. Yes the results from number 10 still hold. The rules of exponents hold for all integers. There are many examples that would be appropriate. We write 1/b as b-1; then 1/b2 = b-2. In general, we have 1/bn = b-n, because 1/bn in S4 is under -n in S3. The 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 can be written as 1 = b0. So a 0 exponent always means 1, while a negative exponent means 1 over the corresponding positive power of the base b. log 31 = __0_ log381 = __4_ log33 = _1__ log31/3 = _-1__ log39 = __2_ log3 1/243 = __-5_ log327 = _3__ log31/2187 = _-7\n13. 14.\n15.\nPart 4: Filling up the sequences 16. 1.0000001 1.0000002 1.0000003 1.0000004 1.0000005\nRaising 1.0000001 to a small power seems just to be 1 with 6 decimal places after the 0 and then the small power, although with more decimal places, we would find more distinctions between the numbers. In any case, these numbers are very close together, differing by only .0000001. To get to 3, however, we would need to find n such that (1.0000001)n = 3. The calculator shows that n needs to be something near 11,000,000. It is therefore not very feasible to continue the sequence in this way. 17. We must have tt = 2 because the 1 (from + ) in S1 corresponds to 2 in S2. The solution to the equation t2 = 2 is t = 2. The calculator shows that this is equal approximately to 1.414. And since we use exponents of 2 to designate numbers in S2, we also have t = 21/2. That is, 21/2 = 2. Then log2 t = log2 2 = . Since u3 = 2, we have u = 3 2 = 1.260 = 21/3. Since v3 = 4, because 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 2 and 2 in S1 corresponds to 4 in S2, we get v = 3 4 = 1.587 = 22/3. We could also find v by\n18.\n95\nnoting that v = u2, because 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. It follows that v = ( 3 2 )2. So there are two different ways of expressing v in radical form. Also, log2 u = 1/3 and log2 v = 2/3. 19. The number corresponding to is 4 2 = 1.189 = 21/4. The number corresponding to is 4 8 = ( 4 2 )3 = 1.682 = 23/4. The number corresponding to 3/2 is 8 = (2)3 = 2.828 = 23/2. The number corresponding to 4/3 is 3 16 = ( 3 2 )4 = 2.520 = 24/3 and the number corresponding to 5/4 is 4 32 = ( 4 2 )5 = 2.378 = 25/4. The logarithms to the base 2 of these numbers are, in each case, the fraction that we began with. The number in S2 which corresponds to the fraction m/n in S1 is 2m/n. Since the nth power of this number is 2m, corresponding to the fact that the product of m/n by n is m, we can write this number as n 2 . Also, since m/n is m times 1/n, we know that 2m/n is 21/n raised to the power m. Since 21/n is equal to n 2 , we can also write 2m/n as ( n 2 )m. The calculator shows that 2317/200 = 3 (to three decimal places) and also that 2306/109 = 7 (also to three decimal places). The sum of 317/200 and 306/109 is 95753/21800 and 2 raised to that power is equal to 21, again to three decimal places. Thus 95753/21800 in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. Answers may vary.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n96\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Student Pages\nPart I: Relationships Consider the two following sequences: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\n1. Rewrite the numbers in sequence S2 as powers of a single number. How are the sequences related? 2. Note that when two terms of S2 are multiplied, such as 64 and 128, their product, (64)(128) = 8192, is another term of S2. Pick a few pairs of your own to multiply. Is the product always another term of S2? You may have to extend the terms in each sequence to verify your observations. 3. Note that the number in S1 corresponding to 64 is 6, while the number in S1 corresponding to 128 is 7. The number corresponding to their product, 8192, is 13, the sum of 6 and 7. In other words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. Check that this holds for the other pairs you picked in exercise 2. 4. In a brief paragraph, summarize what you have observed. Most importantly, give a justification for your results using rules of exponents. We will now see if similar laws hold for other mathematical operations. In particular, we will examine the operations of division and taking powers. 5. Take any two terms in S2 and divide the smaller one into the larger. Do at least three cases. In each case, check the corresponding numbers in S1 of your two terms as well as their quotient. 6. After trying several pairs of terms in S2, describe how you could divide any two terms in S2 without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand. 7. Take any term in S2 and raise it to a positive integer power. Do at least three cases. Again, observe the corresponding numbers in S1 of the terms you choose and calculate. 8. After trying several cases, describe how you could raise any term in S2 to a positive integral power without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand.\n97\n9. From the previous problems, we have seen how to multiply, divide and raise to powers by relating terms in S1 and S2 in appropriate ways. Assume that you had no calculator or computer device at your disposal. How would these relationships help you to make complex computations? Explain! Part 2 Extending the Results At this point, we should try to generalize our findings and describe them with some more general mathematical symbols or notation. To do this, let's look at the two following sequences where b > 0. S3: S4: 1 b 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 b5 6 b6 7 b7 8 b8 9 ... b9 ... n bn\nWe begin by defining a function, L(x), which has as its domain the elements of S4. The \"value\" of L(x) is its corresponding term in S3. For example L(b6)=6. In general, L(bn)=n for any positive integer n. 10. Review your results from Part 1 of the project. Do you think they hold here? In particular, use the general terms of S3 and S4 to check if the properties hold. Use algebra only to show that they are true. (Do not plug in values for b. That way, you will be showing the general relationships hold.) 11. Verify that your conclusions in number 10 are actually the following in function notation. Let u and v be terms in S4. Use algebra to show the following three properties hold. L(u) + L(v) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(u/v) L(uk) = k L(u)\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier Now extend the Sequence S3 and S4 to the left as follows: S3 ... -5 -4 5 S4 ... 1/b 1/b4 -3 1/b3 -2 1/b2 -1 1/b 0 1 1 b1 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 ... b5 ...\n12. Why is it reasonable to extend S4 to the left in the way we did? In particular, why should the number in S4 under 0 in S3 be 1? And why should the numbers in S4 under the negative values in S3 be 1 divided by powers of b? Your explanation may well be by analogy to the development of the sequences initially.\n98\n13. Do the general results from number 11 still hold? Test them out by trying a few terms in S3 and S4. Show your examples. Move on when you're convinced that the rules hold for the extended sequences. 14. How can you write the quotients at the left side of S4 in exponential notation? How would you write the 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 in exponential notation? Give a brief definition of what a negative exponent means and what a 0 exponent means. At this point, recall our original sequences, S1 and S2: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\nJohn Napier, the Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms, called the terms of the sequence S1 the \"logarithm\" of the corresponding terms of the sequence S2. The word \"logarithm\" is a translation of the Greek word logarithmos which comes from the Greek words meaning ratio and number; it therefore means \"the number that counts the ratios.\" For example, he called 7 the logarithm of 128. This example shows how many ratios are required for the term 128 to be found. (Note that Napier did not use base b = 2 as in S2, but the ideas are the same.) The function developed in number 11 above is a logarithmic function for base b = 2. We now replace our L notation relating numbers in S1 to those in S2 by the new notation \"log2\" (read as logarithm to the base 2). Thus we have the following results: log21 = 0, log22 = 1, log24 = 2 , log28 = 3, etc.\n15. Use this \"log\" notation above to associate the corresponding terms of the following two sequences: S5 S6 0 1 1 3 2 9 3 27 4 81 5 243 6 729 7 2187\nFind the following... log 31 = ___ log381 = ___ In general, log33 = ___ log31/3 = ___ log39 = ___ log3 1/243 = ___ log327 = ___ log31/2187 = ___\nlogba = c if and only if bc = a.\nThis is the classic modern definition of a logarithm.\n99\nAt this point it is very important to remember that Napier did not use this kind of notation! What we are doing here is trying to see the link between our modern logarithms and the theoretical ideas behind Napier's logarithms. Again, Napier started with two related sequences and then went in a very different direction than we do. Part 4 Filling up the sequences Recall that Napier's original motivation for developing logarithms was to replace multiplication and division by addition and subtraction. The use of these sequences enable us to do this on a very limited scale. We can, for example, by the use of sequences S1 and S2 replace the multiplication 16 times 32 by the addition 4 plus 5. And we can replace the division of 256 by 64 by the subtraction of 6 from 8. But what happens if we want to multiply 3 by 7? Neither of these numbers is in S2 and will not be even if we extend the row further to the left or right. What can we do about this? What we need is to have more numbers in S2. One way to accomplish this and this is essentially Napier's idea is to use a base much closer to 1 than our base of 2. Napier, in fact, used 1.0000001. So the first few terms of his sequences, which we will label S7 and S8 looked like the following: S7 S8 1 1.0000001 2 (1.0000001)2 3 (1.0000001)3 4 (1.0000001)4 5 (1.0000001)5\n16. Use your calculator to rewrite the numbers in S8 in decimal form. What do you notice about these numbers? Given that we wanted to multiply 3 by 7, about how many numbers would we need to take in the sequence S8 in order for 3 (or even a number very close to 3) to appear? Is this feasible? Napier used some very clever ideas to shorten what looks like an impossible task. Yet he nevertheless worked over twenty years on his table. We will look a somewhat different method for putting more numbers in S2. We will first fill in S1 and then try to figure out the appropriate correspondences. We begin by putting in between the 0 and the 1. We now must determine what the corresponding number in S2 must be. We will call it t. S1 S2 0 1 1 t 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64\n17. To determine t, we need to use the properties of these sequences. In particular, we know that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2. Therefore, since + = 1 in S1, we must have tt = 2. (Why?) We can rewrite this equation as t2 = 2. What is t? Write the answer in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. In terms of the log2 notation, what is log2 t? 18. Now put 1/3 and 2/3 in their appropriate positions in S1. Let u be the number in S2 corresponding to 1/3 and v be the number corresponding to 2/3. Again using the property\n100\nthat addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, write an equation which u must satisfy. Solve the equation to determine u in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Then determine v similarly. (Note that instead of using the property that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, you may wish to use the property that multiplication in S1 corresponds to taking powers in S2.) What are log2 u and log2 v? 19. Now put and in their appropriate positions in S1. As in question 18, determine the corresponding numbers in S2 in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Do the same for the numbers 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 in S1. Determine the logarithm to the base 2 of each of the numbers you have now found in S2. 20. By analogy to your solutions to problems 17, 18, and 19, determine in exponential form and in radical form the number in S2 corresponding to the fraction m/n in S1. Use explicitly one or more of the properties relating S1 to S2. Since we have now filled in S1 with as many fractions as we like, we have also filled in S2 with lots of numbers. If we want to multiply 3 by 7, we now need to determine the numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 in S2. 21. The numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 are log2 3 and log2 7, respectively. Show that log2 3 is approximately equal to 317/200 and that log2 7 is approximately 306/109. You will need to use your calculator and the general definition of a logarithm. Find the sum of 317/200 and 306/109. Show that this number in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. 22. Find two other numbers to multiply by the method of exercise 21. You may have to experiment a bit with your calculator to do this. 23. Consult at least two reliable sources (other than the Internet) in the library and write a short biography of John Napier. Your account should include information not contained in this document. Also, find at least one major application of logarithms (not discussed in class) and briefly describe it. Your write up must be typed and be no more than two pages doublespaced. See me if you need resources to consult.\n101\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Properties of exponents; Properties of logarithms; Definition of logarithm) Objective: The purpose of this activity is to give the students an opportunity to investigate, on a introductory level, one way that logarithms can be calculated. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator (optional) Time Frame: One class period with homework assigned to finish the student activity. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss briefly the included Historical Background with the class. The teacher may also want to review the definitions and properties of logarithms and exponents. It would be a beneficial for the teacher to work the activity before presenting it to the class especially to think about different ways to get the solutions, since some of the methods of solution are not unique. Additionally, the order in which to calculate the logarithms is not necessarily the numerical order, so the teacher will want to warn the students of this fact and perhaps give some hints about what to do when. Also note that these are base 10 logarithms that are being calculated.

Therefore log 1 = 0 (this is true for logarithms of any base) At this point it might be best to find log 10 next since it is also easy to calculate: log 10 = y 10y = 10 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 10 y = 1. Therefore log 10 = 1 log 2 Consider the following relationship: 210 = 1024 1000 = 103 210 103 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 210 log 103 Now use the power property of logarithms: 10 log 2 3 log 10 And solve for log 2: log 2 (3 log 10)/10 = (3 1) / 10 = 0.3 So log 2 0.30 log 3 Consider the following relationship: 37 2187 2 1093 2 103 37 2 103\nTake the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 37 log (2 103) Now use the sum property of logarithms: log 37 log 2 + log 103\n103\nNow use the power property of logarithms: 7log 3 log 2 + 3log 10 Solve for log 3: log 3 (log 2 + 3 log 10)/7 (0.30 + 31)/7 = 3.3/7 = 0.47 So log 3 0.47 log 4 Since 4 = 22, So log 4 0.6 log 5 Since 5 = 10/2, log 5 = log (10/2) = log 10 log 2 (by the difference property of logarithms.) 1 0.30 = 0.70 So log 5 0.70 log 6 Since 6 = 23 , log 6 = log (23) = log 2 + log 3 (by the sum property of logarithms.) 0.3 + 0.47 = 0.77 So log 6 0.77 log 7 Consider the following relationship: 72 = 49 50 = 102/2 72 102/2 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 72 log 102/2 Now use the difference property of logarithms: log 72 log 102 log 2 Now use the power property of logarithms: 2 log 7 2 log 10 log 2 Solve for log 7: log 7 (2 log 10 log 2)/ 2 (21 0.30 )/2 = 1.70/2 = 0.85 So log 7 0.85 log 4 = log 22 = 2 log 2 2(0.3) = 0.6\n104\nlog 8 Since 8 = 23, So log 8 0.90 log 9 Since 9 = 32, So log 9 0.94 log 10 log 10 = 1 (see above) Solutions for Part 2: 1. 2. Since log 1 and log 10 are exact values, an equal sign is used and since the other values are approximations, the approximately equal sign is used. Since the other numbers, such as 4, 6 and 8 are products of these prime numbers, we are able to use the approximate values for the logarithms of 2, 3 and 7. Another reason would be that there is no easy way to use the definition of logarithm to find, say log 2 since by the definition, log 2 = y 10y = 2. (Suggestion for additional activity using a graphing calculator, find the intersection of the graphs of y1 = 10x and y2 = 2, to find a value for log 2.) The values are not the same because of the approximations used in the calculations in the project. The values are not exact since approximations were used for log 2, log 3 and log 7. As an example, log 6 was found using both of the approximations for log 3 and log 2. Using a calculator, log 6 = 0.7781513, while the approximation is 0.77. The difference in values is more than 0.008. Using the calculator, log 3 = 0.4771213 and log 2 = 0.30103 while the approximations were log 3 0.47 and log 2 0.30. Both of these approximations were closer to the calculator values than that of log 6. There are many examples of other relationships such as 72 = 49 = 5 10 and so on. 5. The estimate for log 2 is too large because 210 is larger than 103 log 9 = log 32 = 2 log 3 2(0.47) = 0.94 log 8 = log 23 = 3 log 2 3(0.30) = 0.90\n3. 4.\n105\nThe estimate for log 5 is too small because the approximation for log 2 is too large and this value is subtracted from an exact value resulting in an approximation that is too small. 6. There are many approaches. One possible solution is that 112 = 121 120 = 456 Taking the log of both sides gives : 2 log 11 = log 456 = log 4 + log 5 + log 6 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.77 = 2.07 So log 11 2.07/2 log 11 1.035 (the calculator value is 1.0413927)\n106\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Student Pages\nHistorical Background Briggs and Napier each spent many years in doing lengthy computations to determine logarithms. Since Napier did not use base 10 for his logarithms, but Briggs did, this project will demonstrate Briggs' approach. Keep in mind though, that we will be finding approximations for only a few common logarithms and will not have nearly the accuracy that Briggs found when he was developing his logarithm tables. Recall the definitions and properties that you know for logarithms: Definition: logb x = y by = x Sum Property of logarithms: logb(xy) = logb x + logb y Difference Property of logarithms: logb(x/y) = logb x - logb y Power Property of logarithms: logb xn = n logb x Part 1: Find approximations for the common logarithms for the positive integers 1 through 10. Recall that common logarithms are base 10 logarithms. To help get started, there are several hints of approaches to use for finding the logarithms of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 7. log 1 = _________ log 2 __________ log 2\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem (Part 2)Let f (x) be continuous and nonnegative on [a, b] and let A(x) be the area under the graph of y = f (x) over the interval [a, x].

{"text": "Release date: August 5, 2008 | Age Range: 11 and upEditorial Reviews\n\nMcKellar takes a lightweight approach to math, but is deadly serious about it. In the prologue, she writes that \"lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college.\" Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.\n\nMcKellar -- famous for playing Winnie Cooper in the \"The Wonder Years\" but also a summa cum laude math graduate from UCLA -- uses simple language and lots of illustrations to teach pre-algebra. Each chapter covers a single topic, such as the distributive property or exponents. She clearly explains each topic, and includes problems for the reader to solve (answers are in the back). The author is generous with helpful notes and shortcuts.\n\nA lively, breezy writing style makes it seem as if McKellar is sitting next to the reader. She uses examples girls can relate to, like clothes shopping, working on the school play, blind dates, parties, kissing and breath mints. It's like having the perfect math tutor. (I'm not a middle school girl, of course, but I just got finished having one. My daughter is starting high school this month.)\n\nEspecially good are the entries called Danica's Diary, which are true stories from the author's life as a student, actress and mathematician. One is titled: Dumbing Ourselves Down for Guys: Why is it so Tempting? McKellar gives practical advice on how girls can avoid this common pitfall.\n\nPart 2: Variable Stuff Chapter 6: The Blind Date. Getting Cozy with Variables. Chapter 7: Backpack Too Heavy? Adding and Subtracting with Variables. Chapter 8: Something Just Went \"Squish.\" Multiplying and Dividing with Variables. Chapter 9: Do You Like Him Like Him? Combining Like Terms. Chapter 10: The Costume Party. The Distributive Property. Chapter 11: Didn't That Guy Say He Was Going to Call? Using Variables to Translate Word Problems. More Than 20 Ways to Beat Stress Math... In Jobs You Might Never Expect!\n\nI am a mother that went back to college later in life. One of my classes was algebra. I had math anxiety and tried to find way to wiggle my way out of this class. The algebra class was very difficult for me. I could not understand the instructor or the book. I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both). So I had a six week break before I had to take the algebra class again. I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!\n\nDanica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school.", "original_score": 8.08148815229064, "segments_extracted": 8}

By working with professors from science, engineering, mathematics\nand computer science departments, the project aims to foster the creation of\ninterdisciplinary courses that demonstrate the interdependence of mathematics\nand science. For example, at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy , first semester students study the concept of change\nfrom both a discrete and a continuous point of view. At the end of the\nsemester students must model and solve particular problems by using a\ndiscrete dynamical system and by using a differential equation. Students then\ncompare and discuss the appropriateness and the results of the two\napproaches. Within the four-course core program, students at the United\nStates Military Academy also examine mathematical topics from the\nperspectives of linear versus nonlinear and stochastic versus deterministic.\nAt Carroll College, a 4-class core consisting of a total of 18 credit hours\ncovers many of the topics seen in the first two years of a traditional\ncurriculum, including differential and integral calculus, multivariable\ncalculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The core also includes\ntopics not usually seen early, if at all: discrete dynamical systems, partial\ndifferential equations, probability, and statistics.

Give the rate at which the temperature and volume of the gas are increasing, and then ask about the rate of change in pressure when the volume and temperature reach certain amounts.\n\nThe total energy stored in a capacitor is $\\frac{1}{2} Q^2 / C$, where $Q$ is the amount of charge stored in the capacitor and $C$ is the capacitance. Give the value of $C$ and the rate at which $Q$ is decreasing, and ask about the rate at which the capacitor is losing energy when the energy is a certain amount.\n\nIn astronomy, the absolute magnitude $M$ of a star is related to its luminosity $L$ by the formula\n$$\nM \\;=\\; M_{\\text{sun}} -\\; 2.5\\; \\log_{10}(L/L_{\\text{sun}}).\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\text{sun}} = 4.75$ and $L_{\\text{sun}} = 3.839 \\times 10^{26} \\text{watts}$. (Note that, by convention, brighter stars have lower magnitude.) If the absolute magnitude of a variable star is decreasing at a rate of $0.09 / \\text{week}$, how quickly is the luminosity of the star increasing when the magnitude is $3.8$?\n\nIt's easy to make these up: just think of any equation in science or economics whose derivative might be interesting.

{"text": "the only conceptual demand that is somewhat independent of the context is manipulating the algebraic expression to yield simpler algebraic expressions. That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to \"demonstrate further\" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. \"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.", "original_score": 9.117820448203926, "segments_extracted": 3}

Math Center Level 1 consists of Graphing calculator 2D, Advanced Calculator, Simple Calculator, Simple Calculator, Simple Rational Calculator, and Simple Integer Calculator called from the Control Panel. Simple calculator is a general purpose calculator which combines use simplicity and calculation power. It handles simple arithmetic operations and complex formulas. Advanced Calculator is a step farther in complexity comparing to the Simple Calculator. The Advanced Calculator has two editing windows. One is for editing x, and the second is for editing f(x). In the x window you can enter any number or formula which contains numbers. In the f(x) window you can enter formulas containing numbers and formulas containing x. First, x will be calculated. Then the result for x will be substituted into the formula for f(x). The presence of two editing windows demands switching between windows. You can do it by clicking buttons \"go to x\" and \"go to f(x)\", or by clicking inside the window. If you forget to enter x, then the x=1 will be assumed. If you forget to enter f(x), then f(x)=x will be assumed. Advanced Calculator works in scientific mode. All numbers in internal calculations are treated in scientific format. Graphing Calculator 2D has two panels. The Left Panel has the Magnifying Square represented by Small Square with gray border on the Left Panel. It is 16 times smaller than the Left Panel. The Right Panel shows content of the Magnifying Square magnified 16 times. You can press button \"zoom +\". Then the Left and Right Panels will be zoomed twice each.

{"text": "John Foradori's Math Blog\nTips to survive the mathematics journey!Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000en-UShourly1 algebra classes\n 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000John Foradori have fallen in love with the function-approach to algebra, and if I were teaching algebra 1, or even below that (as the CCSSM allows), everything would be taught from the perspective of a function.\n\nStarting with functions from day one, you can reinforce everything about the functions, domains, ranges, families, etc with each and every lesson (just about!).\n\noperations on expressions? Yep, start with a function that has the expressions you want. You can get so much more out of it. This can lead to so much more understanding. In class right now, students are dealing with rational functions in the form f(x)=a/(x-h) +k, finding the characteristics, then rewriting it as a quotient of two polynomials and comparing the graphs. Good stuff, and can be done with every type of function. I think it gives meaning to algebraic manipulation, why do we do it, what happens when we do it, and how does it really change the original function. These are powerful questions whose answers give real depth and meaning to the algebra classes.\n\nI went through the EMATHS training, but the classes I taught never really let me explore the shifts that strongly (namely statistics and AP Calculus). I had a feeling that the function-based approach was, in my opinion, stronger and more flexible than the other way, but since I never had a chance to really explore it, it wasn't cemented.\n\nIt is now. Everything that can be done in a math class can be done from a function perspective and so much more. I will never go back!\n\nThere have been questions about learning procedures, the rigor of some of the algebraic skills like \"simplifying\" expressions, applying properties, etc. It's all there, all of it. It's just a different way of getting there.\n\nI will leave this with a story. Since we were converting a rational function from one form to another, and to get the students thinking about what is going on, I took a piece of paper and told them this was a function. We can do a lot with a function in this form, and we came up with a lot of uses for it. Then I crumpled up the paper and asked how I changed the paper. Did I add anything? Did I take anything away? Is it still that original piece of paper, just dressed up differently? Then I asked about the uses of my crumpled up piece of paper. Can I do the same things? Can I do different things? I highlighted the different uses of the wad of paper by playfully tossing it around the room. When we discuss this as a group, hopefully we will get to the point that even if a function is in a different form, it really hasn't changed (check the graphs), but the uses for it have.\n\nThe last couple of days have been heavy on the direct instruction. I saw that this group wasn't getting too much out of working in groups, and since the upcoming topics (logs, log properties, solving exponential and log equations) could be approached a little more traditional, I made the command decision to focus on small chunks of information and practice. So far, it's working pretty well.\n\nThese students are solving the equations graphically and then algebraically, which is all I can ask for right now. They are getting more and more comfortable with the tech and with the content, which will lead to next week and more group work on some exploration activities. They are making pretty good progress!\n\n]]> Summer School Adventure! #1\n 30 Jun 2012 13:56:48 +0000John Foradori all (anyone that is taking time from their summer vacation to read this!)\n\n1. Set-up\nSetting up the technology was a bit of an issue. The biggest thing was getting the Ti-Navigator set up and running. I had to upgrade the operating systems first and do a lot of the hardware upgrades. Not a big deal, and not unexpected, but it took a few days to get them started. Finally, on Wednesday, I got the bugs worked out of the navigator, the class set up, and everything working. More on that later!\n\n2. The Teaching\nEven being out of the classroom for only a year made the first couple of days a bigger challenge than I anticipated. My last classroom experience was a class I taught at Macomb CC, which is a little different than teaching in high school. I found myself falling back into that routine a little bit more than the high school routine. It took a couple of days for me, but I hit a groove during the day on Thursday.\n\n3. The Students\nIt took a while to get them into the swing of things as well. Summer school is an interesting experience, and can be a very dry, extremely oppressive atmosphere (in my opinion) for the students. Since it is credit recovery, they are there because of past failures, and their attitudes about math and math classes are very negative. Put them in a room that is high stakes, for five hours a day, and this could lead to a very negative atmosphere. So far, though, the students have been really good and have been participating, especially in the last couple of days. In fact, they are very engaged, and I think I've found the reason for it:\n\nOnce I got this thing up and running, and once I got used to it (it took me a couple of days, and I think the class slowed a bit because of it), things started to roll! For example, yesterday we were dealing with exponential functions. We had a whole class discussion of what exponential growth was (I use The Matrix as an example, when Agent Smith, the bad program, develops the power to copy himself, and we discuss how long it takes him to take over a world with 8 billion people in it). With some guidance on my part, we developed the function f(x)=1*2^x, and what all the parts of the function were. I expanded it to f(x)= initial value * (growth factor)^x. We worked through some examples of finding the parts of the function, the initial value and growth factor. ( f(x)=a*(1+r)^x )\n\nEvery student had an answer, and we had a discussion about the answers, about every student's answers. There were about 3 misconceptions that came up that we were able to address immediately. Every student saw their answer on the screen, and I was able to give instantaneous feedback, and students got instantaneous feedback.\n\nThis is a form of formative assessment (FA), and I've used it a lot over the last couple of days. It is amazing how effective FA's are at clearing up misconceptions fast and moving the class forward. I was trying to use them before I left the classroom, but I don't think I fully \"got it\" then. I get it now. Granted, I have a great tool to use, the navigator, and not all the math teachers have them. There are other ways to get them going. More on that in the future.\n\nI am rambling, too much coffee. I will discuss more of my views and experiences as we go through the summer.\n\nHighlights:\n—I love the technology!\n—Formative Assessments are a huge key to moving a class forward. (and you don't need the tech to do it, you just need some creativity)\n—Get the students engaged, working, and hold them to it!\n—These students, who hate math, are showing improvement!\n—Give them hope that they can do it, give them tasks that they can succeed on, and build on that success.\n\n]]> Wormeli on Differentiation\n 06 Jan 2012 18:50:10 +0000John Foradori is an excellent source on Differentiated Instruction.

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \"algebra\" broadly, defining it as a \"method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance\". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is \"the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge\" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

{"text": "Using CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus\n\nOne way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures. I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments. Before giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board.

{"text": "The grading scheme from the student guide is reproduced below.\nThere are three components to the student's grade.\nAs the instructor, you are responsible for the determining the\nsection component and how you will\nuse it to adjust the student's final course grade.\n\nEvaluating the section component. Since we consider cooperative\nlearning to be an essential feature of the introductory program, we\nrequire that team homework count for at least 40% of the section component.\nAside from that, it is up to you how to determine the section component\nof the grade. For example, you may choose to give weekly individual or\ngroup quizzes and/or\ndaily reading quizzes; you may choose to collect individual homework;\nyou may choose to give credit for in-class work, presentations, extra\ncredit, good team evaluations, etc. It helps to choose a system\nthat encourages study habits that you believe will contribute to\nstudent learning.\n\nThe Grading System: Reproduced from the Student Guide\n\n1. The uniform component.\nThere are two uniform midterm exams and a uniform final exam.\nEach of these exams will be taken by all students\nin all sections at the same time, and are graded by all the instructors\nworking together.\nYour uniform component score will be determined from your scores on each exam as follows:\n\nAfter each exam, a letter grade will be assigned to your uniform component score using\na scale determined\nby the course director specifically for that exam.\nWe do not use the \"10-point scale\" often seen in high school\ncourses in which scores in the 90's get an A,\nin the 80's get a B, and so forth;\nthe level of difficulty of the exams will be considered.\nThe scale for the uniform component score will apply to all students in all sections.\n\n2. The section component. To help you learn the material,\nyou will be given a variety of reading assignments, team homework,\nindividual homework, quizzes and other in-class activities. Your instructor will decide how the section component is determined for your particular section and grade the section work to determine your section score.\nThe section component has the potential to increase your final grade above the baseline grade by one third of a letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to an A-, etc.); and, assuming that the assigned work is completed, this component cannot lower your final grade below the baseline grade by more than one third of a letter grade. So, if you are keeping up with the course and doing well\nin your section work,\nit will not only help you to do well in the uniform exams, but may also\nadd to your baseline grade. Similarly, if you\nfall behind in your section work, it may reduce your baseline grade.\n\n3. The gateway component. There will be one or two (depending\non the course you are taking)\nonline basic skills gateway test(s) which you need to pass by the\ndeadline announced in the course schedule. These routine tests are repeatable,\nand in general do not pose a problem for students who are keeping up with the course work.\nYou may practice each test online\nas many times as you like, and you may take\na test for a score as often as twice per day\nuntil the deadline. The gateway tests do not have the potential to raise your baseline\ngrade, but if they are not passed by the deadline, the gateway component will\nautomatically reduce your final grade in the course. Deadlines and grade penalties\nwill be announced in your class. All sections of your course have the same deadlines\nand penalties assigned to the gateway component.\n\nSection averages.\nCourse policy is that a section's average final letter grade cannot differ\ntoo much from that section's average baseline letter grades.\nThis means that the better your entire section does on the uniform exams,\nthe higher average letter grade your instructor can assign in your section.\nIt is therefore in your best interest to help your fellow students in\nyour section do well in this course.\nIn other words, cooperation counts!\n\nGrades at the university.\nMany students who come to the University of Michigan have to adjust\nthemselves to college grading standards.\nThe mean high school grade point average\n(recalculated using only strictly academic classes)\nof our entering students is around 3.6,\nso many of you were accustomed to getting \"straight A's\"\nin high school.\nStudents' first reaction to college grades is often,\n\"I've never gotten grades like these.\"\nHowever, a grade of 15/20 on a team homework assignment\n(which you might previously have converted to 75% - a high school C)\nmay well be a good score in a college math course.\nYour own instructor is your best source of information on\nyour progress in the class.\n\nDescribing the grading system to students. You should state\nexplicitly how you plan to arrive at semester grades - what exams will be\ngiven, approximately what weight they will have in the overall assessment of\nthe student's work, how team homework is counted, how much quizzes will\ncount, etc. The in-class component of the grade can be based on quiz\nscores, individual homework, class participation, or whatever you find\nappropriate. It is important to not to assign letter grades to the\nin-class component of the grade because the grades you award at the end of\nthe term will have to be in alignment with the performance of your class on\nthe uniform exams.\n\nGrade books and records. Keep a good, clear record of your\ngrades in a secure place. Don't lose it. Record all scores which\nwill count towards students' grades. Many grades complaints can be\nprevented by keeping accurate records. It's easy to forget to record\ngrades before returning papers, so record everything, including all grade\nchanges, immediately. Students are very serious about their grades and\nexpect them to be treated as a strictly private matter. You do not\nneed to keep a record of students' attendance unless you choose to, however,\nyou may want to note any extended absences.\n\nComplaints about your grading. From the point of view of\nUniversity of Michigan students, a great deal hinges on getting the high\ngrades they are accustomed to getting in high school. Many first term\nfreshman have never had a grade lower than an A! They will often\nargue persistently over one or two points. This is not a sign that they\ndon't respect you. Of course, you should treat all student\ncomplaints about grading mistakes or unfairness in a serious manner.", "original_score": 10.970027191612989, "segments_extracted": 12}

{"text": "Number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., and related objects that arise in their study. It is tempting to assume that something as simple as the counting numbers must be rather well understood. But this is far from the case! Indeed, number theory owes much of its charm to the wealth of easily-stated problems -- possible to explain to middle-school age children -- which have so far defied solution, despite hundreds of years of effort by great mathematicians.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the foundational results, with particular attention paid to some the pathbreaking accomplishments of the 18th and 19th centuries. We will start with the basic theory (factorization into primes) before turning to Gauss's theory of congruences. The theory of congruences culminates with a proof of Gauss's Aureum Theorema (golden theorem), the law of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nMore advanced topics will be discussed later in the course. Possibilities include theorems about sums of squares, results on arithmetic functions, and results on the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nNumber theory, more than some other areas of mathematics, is largely an experimental science. It is recommended (but not required) that you download software that allows you to play with very large numbers.

{"text": "Calculator: Calculators may come in handy during class or in\nyour homework from time to time, but I will not require you to have\none. They will be allowed on tests and homework, though on tests you\nwill find them to be of limited value. If you intend on sharing a\ncalculator with a friend, keep in mind that sharing calculators is not\npermitted on exams.\n\nIdeally, a calculator should be able to do ordinary arithmetic operations,\nas well as some additional functions like exponentiation (powers) and\nsquare roots. It need not be able to graph or be programmed.\n\nEmail list: math102@yahoogroups.com (when you fill out your information\nyou may elect to be on this list)\n\nWell, what math background are you expected to have? I realize that the\nrange of math classes taken by students in math 102 varies widely, and\nthis includes the extent to which students remember various facts.\nThis course, however, is not in sequence with the standard math sequence,\nand so mastery of past math subjects is not as relevant in this class\nas compared to what you might be used to.\n\nMost of the course is based on concepts rather than specific skills,\nthough some skill will come in handy at some points. Though these\ntimes are relatively rare, the strong reaction some students feel when\nthey do not know the relevant skils may make it loom large in their\nminds. Most of these skills, when they come up, are at the\npre-algebra and algebra level: using variables, understanding\nalgebraic expressions, and sometimes solving simple equations. It is\nassumed that students have had exposure to algebra and geometry at\nsome point, but it is not assumed that they have a strong mastery of\neither subject.\n\nThe Idea of this class: This is most likely a very different kind\nof math class than you have ever had. Most math classes you have\nexperienced emphasize skills: how to solve a quadratic equation, or\nhow to find an unknown side in a triangle. This class will emphasize\nideas and concepts. ``How to do it'' will take a back seat to\n``Why does it work?''\n\nThis is also a course where we seek to discover math together. I'm\nnot here to tell you the answer; I'm more of a guide to help you\nexplore a mathematical concept. Through this course, I hope to show\nyou the big picture: what mathematics is all about. This is something\nthat many students don't see in high school courses, or even some\ncollege level courses. Once you see math from this point of view, I\nhope you will be able to see why mathematicians feel that mathematics\nis beautiful, or how creativity, imagination, and logical thinking can\nwork together in mathematics. I hope you will see how mathematics is\npart of what our civilization is all about: where we have been and\nwhere we are going, and why, to be a truly educated person, one must have some\nfacility with mathematics.\n\nGoals: The student should develop:\n\nObjectives: The specific objectives of this course will partly\nbe determined by the students in one of the first assignments. Students\nwill select topics from the book that are of greatest interest to them,\nand the course will be based on what topics are most popular.\n\nLate assignments: No late homework is accepted. Exceptions can\nbe granted, if you must give me notice that you are going to turn in\nan assignment late at least the class before the assignment is due.\nYou must also have a good reason. These reasons will be treated on a\ncase-by-case basis. When you obtain permission to turn in an\nassignment late, we will discuss a new due date for that homework.\n\nCollaboration: You are encouraged to collaborate on all homework\nassignments, unless otherwise specified. This means you work on it\nindependently before discussing it with each other, and it means you\nmust thoroughly understand how to do the problem before writing it up.\nYou must write up your answers separately; you cannot turn in one\nhomework for more than one person, nor can you simply include\nphotocopies of other students' work. There is no limit to the size\nof a group for collaboration, although 3-5 people tends to be an efficient\nsize.\n\nComments: You should include comments about the class at the top\nof your homework assignments. These comments can be ``This class is\ngoing too fast'', ``I like this section'', ``This is too easy/hard'',\n``Can we have more connections to music'', ``Everything's\nokay'', and so on. You will not be graded on these comments, but they\nwill affect how I teach the class, and may make the class more\nenjoyable for you.\n\nClass participation: You are expected to actively participate in\nclass. Many students view learning as a passive act, where the\nteacher takes the only active role, and the student simply listens, or\nat most takes notes. This view is not advisable in this class. Here,\nyou will need to take an active role in learning the material. {\\em\nYou} are in charge of your education, and {\\em you} should take\nresponsibility to learn the material as thoroughly as you can.\n\nThis is especially true in this class. As you will discover, this\nclass is not a lecture-style class, where I simply proclaim information\nto you and you record the information in your notes. Rather, we will\nbe engaged in mathematics discovery together.\n\nTen percent of your grade is based on my estimate of your class\nparticipation throughout the term. Mostly this is easy points: you\ndon't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged\nin the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make.\nIn fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this\ncourse, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for\nwaiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.\n\nAttendance: Attendance is important. The whole point of the\nclass is for us to discover mathematics together, and you cannot do\nthat if you are not here. Skipping even a single class will mean you\nwill not likely be able to do the work or know what is happening in\nthe next class period. This is not the sort of class where just\nreading the material in the book will allow you to do the work. And, of\ncourse, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points. In\nshort, skip class at your peril.\n\nExams: There will be three midterms, and one final. Each\nmidterm counts for 16% of your grade, and the final counts for 22%.\nHomework counts for 20% and class participation for 10%. the final\nexam grade will substitute for your lowest midterm grade if this is to\nyour advantage. Borderline grades could go either way, depending on\nthe effort I see you put into the class.\n\nMidterms will be during the normal class period. Both midterms and\nfinal will occur in the normal classroom for the class. Dates for\nthese tests are as follows:\n\nFinal (sec. 3)\n\nFinal (sec. 4)\n\nGrading: A grade of C indicates an ability to do homework-like\nproblems, and memorization of all techniques and definitions. In\norder to receive a B, a student must demonstrate a deeper knowledge of\nthe material, being able to apply the course material to new\ncircumstances where applicable. An A student must demonstrate this\nkind of deep understanding in all of the covered topics, as well as be\nable to draw new conclusions from known facts in a logical manner, and\nmust also demonstrate persistence and dilligence. In the other\ndirection, a grade of D shows only superficial understanding of the material,\nand shows inconsistency to do straightforward problems. An F\ngrade indicates that the student has severe gaps in even superficial\nunderstanding of the material in the course.\n\nChristian attitude: Although not part of the grading for this\ncourse, you are expected to approach this class with a Christian\nattitude, being willing to help your fellow classmates to understand\nthe material outside of class, being willing to be corrected by your\nfellow classmates when you see they are right, but firm in your\nconviction otherwise, being bold to ask questions without feeling\nashamed of looking foolish, encouraging one another in love, being\npatient with those who are asking questions, and preferring a grasp of\nthe material, which is enduring and becomes part of you, over a grade,\nwhich is transient, external, and shallow. You should diligently\ndevote the time you spend on this class as to the Lord. As cheating\nharms both the cheater and the rest of the class (though in different\nways), you should not cheat, nor should you provide temptations for\nothers to cheat.\n\nFor my part, I commit to approaching this class with a Christian\nattitude, viewing my role as that of a servant, being concerned first\nfor your personal, especially intellectual, development. I\nwill also seek to produce an environment of encouragement and love,\nthat fosters a sense of community and understanding. I commit to reporting\ngrades that accurately and honestly reflect the level of work done in the\nclass, as described in the paragraphs above. I also commit the time I\nspend preparing for this class as to the Lord, and I will pray for all\nindividuals in the class on a regular basis, understanding that even as I\nmay seek to educate, God provides the true transformation.", "original_score": 14.509187648369956, "segments_extracted": 23}

If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.", "original_score": 9.747292418772563, "segments_extracted": 4}

Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need.

Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions.

{"text": "In Spain, it is well known that secondary school students' motivation to study Science (especially Mathematics) is not very strong. This is a common problem to almost all Europe. Spanish and Andalusian governments have general policies on education to promote the study of Science. They are necessary and convenient. However, we think that local actions in the students' environment, which supplement these policies, are also needed.\nFor this reason, five years ago we founded at the University of Almería an online free journal called Boletín de la Titulación de Matemáticas de la UAL ( mainly addressed to those students. Our intention is to stimulate their interest in mathematics, to develop their mathematical skills, to complement their background, and to improve their perception and assessment of mathematics. Many aspects, usually out of the syllabus, are treated to provide a closer, more real and positive image of mathematics. Another aim is to encourage a closer contact between secondary schools and our university. Although these are our main goals, we do not discard a broader audience and often include articles appropriate for a general public.\nIt is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc. We do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country.\nBoletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world.\nThis project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system. There are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools. The secondary school students are, as said, the main target of this project, and they can participate through the mathematical contest that we pose. There exists a closer contact later in the prize award ceremony at the winner's secondary school. In such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers. No doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience. Regarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called \"Territorio Estudiante\" (Student Area).\nThe journal is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course (October, January and April). Its length is around 20-25 pages and papers published must be short and suitable for a secondary school level. It is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:\n\nFrom Secondary School to University, containing teaching experiences, learning Maths in a foreign language, solutions to the university entrance exam Maths problems, etc.\n\nThe editorial committee consists of 3 main editors and 29 section editors, composed by professors of the University of Almería and teachers from secondary schools of our province, and 4 undergraduate students in charge of the student area. Although our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province. For example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues.\nTo spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes.\nSeveral facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect. We are very interested in knowing if our efforts to bring the Mathematics closer to young people and teachers in schools are useful. Among the methods to know this we use:\n\nAppearance in the local newspapers to achieve more social relevance (see the additional documentation).\n\nNumber of visits that we pay to secondary schools and feedback from them since this quantity points out the interest that the Boletín arouses.\n\nIn conclusion, with the invaluable help of our journal we have set up a reliable atmosphere between professors from our university and teachers from secondary schools in our region of influence. This has permitted to develop other activities jointly such as meetings about mathematical education (I Jornada del Profesorado de Almería,  or the group Almería Matemática in Facebook. Our Maths students at the university benefited from this and there is a growing interest among secondary school students in studying the degree in Mathematics at the University of Almería.", "original_score": 11.176705282226619, "segments_extracted": 6}

TinkerPlots is software for students in grades 4 through 8. The use of software is to build fluency with data representation and exploration. Animation, color, and dynamic manipulation support students in moving from simple representations to increasingly complex and analytic graphs. Another aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data. TinkerPlots also helps teachers to create inquiry-based mathematics classrooms\n\nSpeech Recognition. Windows 7 has a feature that allows people to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. It is Speech Recognition. We can find this feature on Ease of Access. Before we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer. There are some issues that we have to think about before using Speech Recognition: (1) Speech Recognition needs a good microphone. (2) Training the computer to identify the speaker sounds and pronunciation. (3) Speak clearly and pronounce words carefully, not too fast and or too slow. To open Speech Recognition: (1)Start the Speech Recognition by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking Ease of Access, and then clicking Windows Speech Recognitions. (2)Click microphone button to start the listening mode\n\nBy using Speech Recognition we can do the following things: (1) We can use our voice to control our computer. (2) We can say commands that the computer will respond (3) We can dictate text to the computer.\n\nSpeech Recognition makes a classroom or lesson more Universally Designed. Speech recognition allows students to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. This feature is useful to students with a wide range of disabilities including those with visual, mobility and language impairments. This feature will be very useful in a classroom which the numbers of students with disabilities integrated into it. Today, nearly every class and schoolwork are related to computer. For example statistics class, students will analyze graphical displays of data, including dot plots, stem plots, and histograms, to identify and describe patterns and departures from patterns. In this class they will use computer to create graphical displays. By using Speech recognition and Microsoft excel, students with mobility impairment are still able to participate well in the class. They can input data and command to create a graphic.\n\nSpeech Recognition helps students with mobility and visual impairment. Students with mobility impairments might be unable to use (or be without) arms or fingers to interact with their computers using a standard keyboard or mouse. Using their voice is a way to interact with their computer. By using speech recognition they can operate their computer and compose text. Another is visual impairment, blindness, for example. Students who are blind interact with their computers through keyboards, Braille devices, and audio/voice rather than a traditional monitor and mouse. If they don't have these special devices, they are still able to operate their computer by using Speech Recognition.\n\nConclusion A more accessible technology is good for everyone, including students with disabilities and students without disability. All students benefit from technology in which it is easier to function. Providing accessible technology in the classroom to students with disabilities enables all students to have the same opportunities in education. Speech Recognition gives an easy way to interact with computer not only for students with a disability but also those without a disability. It also helps us to make an inclusive classroom with equal access for all students.\n\nIt is little bit difficult to find an appropriate technology device in everyday life for teaching and learning the difficult concept of mathematics. Since mathematics concept is completely different from other concepts such as social science, English, etc.Based on my teaching experience in primary school, when I teach a difficult concept, I had to prove the concept and visualized it. these things can be done by using a software for teaching mathematics that requires a certain specification of a computer.\n\nHowever, Nowadays, there is a technology in education known as mobile learning. Mobile Learning is a learning model adopted cellular technology development and mobile phones where this technology can be used as a learning medium. To use this technology, we can download the applications and install them on a mobile phone or use them online by using mobile phone.\n\nMobile learning technology can be used to teach mathematics. One of web sites that provides mobile learning applications for teaching and learning mathematics is  So far, Mobile Learning is very helpful as a supplement material for teaching mathematics. It is easy for students to bring mobile phones wherever they go, this technology will help them to learn mathematics wherever and whenever.", "original_score": 11.344122575769447, "segments_extracted": 12}

{"text": "Let's talk variables. Do we want students to develop an understanding of variable concepts (whether in a developmental math course or not)? Is accurate use of variable notation enough? If students can model applications and accurately determine solutions … is that enough? Is there a role for linguistic literacy in mathematics?\n\nOne of the issues we face in college is dealing (or not) with prior learning. Without intervention, prior learning (even when inaccurate) survives — often surviving in the face of conflicting information in the current learning environment. Visualize the prior learning as being as a stable mass of 'knowledge' (even though it has gaps and errors); as students go through a class as adults, information that connects positively with the old reinforces the old. When new information does not connect or conflicts with the old, the low-energy (natural) response is to build new storage … resulting in that solid core being supplemented by weak veneers of new knowledge. This, of course, is an incomplete visualization for the actual processes in the human brain. The suggestion is that students approach a math class with an attitude that supports old information and minimizes cognitive effort for dealing with new or incompatible information.\n\nIn my beginning algebra class this week, we did the test on exponents and polynomials. Although the test includes some artificially difficult problems with negative exponents, most of the items deal with important ideas. One of the most basic items on the test was this:\n\nNow, this is a good class — all students are actually doing homework and attending class almost every day. We had dealt with the first situation at the start of the semester. How could these errors survive to this point?\n\nI am planning on incorporating some linguistic activities around variables in the first week of the semester. Some of the ideas are from a old book called \"English Skills for Algebra\" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print. The authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students. Some of their activities involve listening to somebody read mathematical statements and the student writing them down. I think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).\n\nI do know that just saying \"that was wrong … this is right\" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding. I need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables. Some energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together. Without that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.\n\nThus, 5(3b)^2 should be read as \"5 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 5•3b•3b, and the default rule \"when there is no coefficient, it goes without saying that it is 1″ lets us read (3b)^2 as \"1 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 1•3b•3b.\n\n(3) Re \"linguistic activities\", what is very likely to work is having the mathematics text used as the reading material in a remedial English reading course.

{"text": "Mathematics majors typically begin their college mathematics studies with three semesters of Calculus. Calculus is both the cornerstone of \"analysis,\" one of the major branches of pure mathematics, and an indispensable tool for most of the sciences and engineering. Students learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right. Students study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.\n\nAll mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year. This basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, \"algebra\" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications. In linear algebra, the study of linear equations, like those in beginning high school algebra -- but with the possibility of thousands of equations in thousands of unknowns -- leads to abstract mathematical spaces.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a variety of more advanced courses. Students decide which of these to take according to their interests and the particular degree which they seek.\nFor example, students apply multivariable calculus in probability and the mathematical foundations of statistical inference in Theory of Statistics. Related choices include Statistical Methods and Introduction to Experimental Designs, in which one learns how to collect and analyze data, for instance in scientific and industrial experiments.\n\nSimilarly, students can choose mathematics courses with special significance in computer science. A prime example is Applied Graph Theory, featuring mathematical models and algorithms applicable to such problems as traffic systems, activity scheduling, and design layout. Others are Cryptography (how to encrypt data securely) and Coding Theory (how to send messages that self-correct transmission errors).\n\nCourses in pure mathematics concentrate upon the theoretical foundations of algebra, calculus, and other elementary courses, and at the same time point the way toward more advanced topics in modern mathematics. To illustrate, students in Real Variables (or theoretical advanced calculus) learn why the facts and computational methods learned in ordinary calculus are correct; in Modern Algebra, students study various abstract systems which include the familiar objects of school mathematics as special cases (whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, etc.)\n\nIn addition to taking many courses in the major field of study, every undergraduate at Wright State University is required to take a comprehensive program of General Education studies, including courses in history, English, economics, the sciences, and several other disciplines.

In this way, the text communicates to students, the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, helping to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. The authors included in this edition, Problem-Recognition exercises, that many instructors will likely identify to be similar to worksheets they have personally developed for distribution to students. The intent of the Problem-Recognition exercises, is to help students overcome what is sometimes a natural inclination toward applying problem-sovling algorithms that may not always be appropriate. In addition, the exercise sets have been revised to include even more core exercises than were present in the first edition. This permits instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills and develop the knowledge they need to make a successful transition into College Algebra. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class, as they do inside class with their instructor. For even more support, students have access to a wealth of supplements, including McGraw-Hill's online homework management system, MathZone. ...show less7.00 +$3.99 s/h\n\n2006 Hardcover Fair 2008.

Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding.\nThis edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications. The text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers.

{"text": "Math teachers have designed materials for incremental learning and to address a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Students learn concepts and skills by solving carefully sequenced problems; in class, students often work in cooperative groups. Teachers coordinate courses and review frequently so students retain important ideas from year to year. Instead of separate courses in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, all three areas are addressed in each course of an integrated curriculum. Course materials introduce applications to science and other related fields and provide historical context.\n\nCalculators and computers are important tools of modern mathematics. Teachers instruct students in their appropriate use, but also require a firm grasp of basic skills. Students are required to solve many problems without using calculators. The Math Department uses placement examinations, recommendations, and interviews to ensure that each student enrolls in the most suitable course sequence. Almost all students take four years of mathematics, even though only three are required. Math Club meets regularly to share ideas and investigate problems beyond the scope of the normal curriculum. All interested students are welcome to participate. The club also provides opportunities for students to take part in local and national mathematics competitions.\n\nConcepts and applications of algebra, problem solving, and geometry are the main topics in this course, designed to prepare students with diverse mathematical backgrounds for Math II. Students learn how to use the scientific calculator to solve problems and use manipulatives extensively to develop spatial visualization skills. They often work together in small groups in the classroom, developing their collaborative skills and their ability to explain mathematics clearly. Students review and practice algebra skills in a wide variety of situations. Topics include proportional reasoning, geometric similarity and transformations, area and perimeter, linear and quadratic equations, and introductory statistics and probability. This course is coordinated with Integrated Laboratory Science.\n\nThis course covers topics from geometry and algebra. The curriculum encourages connections among topics by continually interweaving them. Emphasis is placed on the development of geometric intuition, deductive logic, proof, and a strong foundation in algebra. Group work is encouraged; activities are done in groups, sometimes with physical models and or computers. Class discussions and group activities enrich the learning experience by developing problem-solving and communication skills.\n\nThe concept of function serves as a framework for this course. Mathematical modeling (deriving a mathematical expression from real-world data) is introduced, and students do experiments and use graphing calculators to gather information. Students purchase a course-specific graphing calculator and are instructed in its use. Algebraic skills are practiced within the context of solving problems, and geometric interpretations and graphing are emphasized. Students continue the study of linear and quadratic equations begun in Math I and Math II, adding new functions to their repertoire: polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms. This course is offered at two levels: Math IlIA and Math III. Both are college preparatory and cover functions and applications. Math IIIA is accelerated, covering topics usually included in algebra honors, trigonometry and precalculus. It prepares students for Level IIC of the College Board SAT Subject Test in Mathematics. Math III covers topics normally taught in advanced algebra and trigonometry.\n\nThis course begins with material from pre-calculus, including a study of functions (polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric) and their graphs. It continues with topics in analytic geometry, linear algebra, vectors and discrete mathematics. The course introduces topics from calculus, such as limits, continuity and derivatives and their applications. Students learn the material through lecture, group work, and homework.\n\nThis\ncourse explores topics across a broad spectrum, including pre-calculus,\ncalculus, economics, finance, and statistics. The emphasis will be on\napplications of mathematics to a variety of fields. In the first semester, we\nwill introduce some of the ideas of set theory, statistics (linear regression\nmodels), economics (supply, demand) and finance (including simple and compound\ninterest). Second semester, we will continue with more finance (annuities and\nloan amortization), probability, single variable statistics (normal curve\ndistributions) and calculus (limits, rates of change, derivatives, and\nintegrals). The goal is to expose students to a variety of techniques and\napplications that will be useful in diverse academic pursuits as well as life\nin general.\n\nHow accurate are opinion polls? Where is the economy really heading? Can you believe the latest \"study\" about health and diet? The media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is. In Statistics, we look at how data are gathered and presented, and how certain the conclusions drawn from them are likely to be. This means using standard formulas, but we will also look at the math behind the formulas, including probability and its applications. There are lab exercises (sometimes with edible \"equipment\") and mini-projects in which students design and carry out original investigations. There are also informal discussions of items in the news. This two-semester course is equivalent to a semester of statistics in college and prepares students for the AP exam. It may be taken after or at the same time as Applied Math, or Math Analysis and Introductory Calculus.\n\nHigh\nschool math includes many beautiful topics, but there is so much more math that\nis accessible to bright and curious high school students like you that we don't\ninclude in our curriculum. There just isn't time to do it all. For those of you\nhungry for more math, The Art of Problem Solving is for you. It is a\none-semester math elective which will cover topics in arithmetic, number\ntheory, and counting and probability, as well as some algebra and geometry that\nisn't already covered in Math I, II, or III/IIIA. Students must have completed\nMath III/IIIA or equivalent to enroll. You don't have to like math contests to\ntake this course, but if you do like them, this course might help you improve\nyour scores. However, the best reason to take this course is that you will\nlearn new math, and equally importantly, it will be interesting and fun.\n\nThe media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is.

He comes to Marlboro after working in several Canadian provinces, and is looking forward to collaborating with logicians in New England and New York.\n\nFrom his experience as a math teacher and teaching assistant for all levels of undergraduate courses, Jean-Martin has learned that many students, especially in introductory courses, are intimidated by mathematics, and view the material as abstract and tedious. He says, \"I try to show them that mathematics can be fun and useful, and most often, especially at the introductory level, not very far removed from reality.

{"text": "Description: This course studies fundamental algebraic systems in mathematics, selected from groups, rings, fields, and modules. Examples of groups include the invertible matrices with a fixed size and the roots of unity. Rings are illustrated by integers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.) Finally, ordinary vectors in space and any lattice in the plane are examples of modules. The concern with these algebraic systems is not simply the study of individual systems, but also of functions between systems which carry one operation into the other. For instance, the determinant not only converts matrices into numbers, but it sends a product of matrices into a product of numbers. The level of attention given to such operation-preserving transformations (putting them on an equal footing with the algebraic systems they transform) is one of the characteristic features of abstract algebra, and also one of the algebraic ideas which have reached into other areas of mathematics.

{"text": "Core Abilities (Note: since this course may be taken in partial fulfillment of the general education requirements, this syllabus includes the following set of core ability goals.)\n\nStudents will develop their verbal mathematical communication skills, both in small groups and in class discussions\n\n3. Life Values: Students analyze, evaluate and respond to ethical issues from informed personal, professional, and social value systems.\n\nSpecific Course Goals:\n\n1. From the perspective of mathematical content, this course should allow the student to expand and apply skills and knowledge gained in the first semester of Calculus to the topics of integration and applications of integration.\n\n5. From a most general perspective, the student should see growth in his/her mathematical maturity. The three-semester sequence of calculus courses form the foundation of any serious study of mathematics or other mathematically-oriented disciplines.\n\nI am a firm believer in the notion that you as the student must be actively engaged in the learning process and that this is best accomplished by your DOING mathematics. My job here is not to somehow convince you that I know how to do the mathematics included in the course, but to help guide YOU through the material; I am to be a \"guide on the side, NOT a sage on the stage\". I may not always say things in the way which best leads to your full comprehension, but I will try to do so and I ask that you try to see your learning as something YOU DO rather than as something I do to you. PLEASE feel free to come see me to discuss questions or concerns you may have during the course; I will not bite! PLEASE ask questions in class if you have them; the only dumb question is the one you fail to ask!\n\nYou should view homework assignments as a test to see how well you understand the material and you should bring to the next class any questions you might have.\n\nGroup Work: In general, I think students can benefit greatly by working together on problems. While there is some danger of the \"blind leading the blind\" syndrome, or of students deceiving themselves into thinking they understand the material better than they actually do, for the most part grappling with ideas and trying to explain them to another student or learning to listen to others explain an idea is a wonderful way to see that you really do understand the material. In class we will spend an occasional day working on a group \"lab\", and we sill also typically have a group \"practice exam\" before the individual exams, and I also encourage you to find a \"learning group\" outside of class.\n\nPortfolio: I will be asking you to keep a PORTFOLIO of your work. This portfolio will be collected twice during the semester, once upon our return from our spring break, on Monday 17 March, and again at the end of the course, on Friday 2 May. Each of these portfolios should be a representative collection of your work during that half of the semester; each collection you turn in should include 5 problems, written up in a finished form, along with a brief discussion of why you chose to include that particular problem. These problems should represent work you are proud of, or problems which brought you to a breakthrough point. Each of these portfolios of your work will be worth 40 points, 8 points per problem. Presumably you will hand in 5 sheets of paper, each of which will include a nicely organized solution to the problem, which might be from homework, or from a lab or worksheet, of from an exam, along with that reflection mentioned above.\n\nGrading: I use a rather traditional Grading Scale: A = 90% (or better), AB = 87%, B = 80%, BC = 77%, C = 70%, CD = 67%, D = 60%. I do try to come up with a mix of points so that exams are not weighted too heavily; about two-thirds of the points during the semester will come from individual, in-class exams - the rest will come from group labs, take-home problems, group practice exams, journals, and portfolios.\n\nLate Assignments: It is rarely much of a problem at the level of a calculus course, but it remains important that students turn in work in a timely manner, so that they do not get behind. Consequently, Late Assignments will be penalized 20% of the possible points for each class period late, up to a maximum of three periods. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted.\n\nIf you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services or other accommodations for this class, please see me or Wayne Wojciechowski in MC 320 (796-3085) within 10 days to discuss your accommodation needs.", "original_score": 13.905470107566877, "segments_extracted": 13}

If you do not finish in one class period, you MUST NOT log on to ALEKS again until you return the next day for class, at which time you can complete your assessment. You must leave record with me as to which problem you were on when you leave, and if you are not on that same problem when you return, you must take the assessment again in the Learning Center. You can use your handwritten notes. DO NOT use the text.\n\n(5) Attendance: A major factor in learning mathematics is a regular and focused schedule of practice. You need to practice virtually every day, and for a considerable amount of time each day in order to establish a solid foundation in algebra. To help you work on ALEKS, classroom attendance is REQUIRED every day. I will be keeping track, and will contact you if you miss too many classes. Your attendance will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nALEKS Time: ALEKS keeps track of how much time you have put in as well as how much progress you have made. It is almost impossible to pass the class if you do not spend additional time outside of class on ALEKS. It is suggested that you spend an additional 2 to3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. This commitment will help ensure successful progress through ALEKS. I will be keeping track of your hours spent on ALEKS, and I will contact you if it appears you are not putting in enough time outside of class. Your total number of hours on ALEKS will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nIt is possible that some of you will actually complete the ALEKS course before the calendar indicates the semester is over, and that's fine. I will still have you take the final exam with the rest of the class on the scheduled date. And it is possible that some of you may reach December without completing the material. ALEKS offers a guarantee that if you do not pass the course despite having put in at least 80 hours, your license to use ALEKS can be renewed for a semester at no cost. In this case, you will be given a grade of \"I\" (Incomplete), allowing you to work towards completion of the course during the next semester. Of course, this is far from ideal since it means you could not yet enroll in the course you need to take for your major. Use the Quiz dates as a goal for completion!\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act: If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations for this class, please see me and/or Wayne Wojciechowski, the campus ADA coordinator (MC 335, 796-3085), within ten days to discuss your needs.\n\nNo Class Meetings:\n\nUsing ALEKS\n\nYou will need the ALEKS Student Access Code on the back of your ALEKS Users' Guide, purchased from the Bookstore. You will also need the Course Code for your section, which is listed below.\n\nOn the first day of class, each of you will log in and we will examine the basics of using ALEKS. I will ask you to work your way through the \"Answer Editor\" tutorial so that you become familiar with how to enter mathematical expressions for assessments, on-line work and quizzes. Then on the second day of class I will have you take the initial ALEKS assessment to get a baseline rating of your skills and readiness for the material in this course. It is important that you always put forth your best effort when taking assessments, because this is how ALEKS determines whether or not you have mastered the material already learned.\n\nALEKS keeps track of (and lets your instructor see) how much you have mastered and what you are ready to learn.

In contrast, the concept\nof limit and its connection with the other mathematical topics in\nthis standard is based on infinite processes. Thus, explorations\nof the topics proposed here not only extend students' knowledge\nof function characteristics but also introduce them to another mode\nof mathematical thinking.\n\nAt a somewhat higher but\nstill intuitive level, the series can be summed by investigating\nthe limit of the sequence of partial sums (either by using a calculator\nor a simple looping computer program or by applying the formula\nfor the sum of a finite geometric series). An understanding of the\nconcept of limit in contexts such as this should in turn contribute\nto the meaningful development of the remaining topics in this standard.\n\nSimilarly, it is important\nthat all students recognize how the concept of the area under a\ncurve builds on and extends their previous experiences with areas\nof geometric figures. College-intending students also should recognize\nhow the rate of change builds on and extends their experiences with\nuniform motion and associated rates in algebra and trigonometry,\nand how the slope of a tangent to a curve generalizes the notion\nof the slope of a line as developed in algebra.\n\nComputing technology makes\nthe fundamental concepts and applications of calculus accessible\nto all students. The area under a finite portion of a curve, for\nexample, can be approximated geometrically by partitioning the region\ninto rectangles with bases of equal length and heights given by\nfunction values at an endpoint of each base. Using a calculator\nor a computer-based algorithm, students can easily sum the areas\nto obtain a numerical approximation of the desired area. This approximation\ncan then be sharpened by using sequences of rectangles whose bases\nare made to decrease toward zero.

{"text": "[Reviewed by Fernando Q. Gouvêa, on 05/20/2010]\n\nLie groups play such a central role in mathematics and its applications that all mathematics students should be aware of them. From computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere. Nevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared. Harriet Pollatsek's Lie Groups is her entry in this list.\n\nHowe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.\n\nI must admit that I find teaching this material to sophomore mathematics majors to be a little bit too much of a reach. Instead, I used the book in a seminar course that followed our standard one-semester introduction to abstract algebra. In the class were six seniors, three juniors, and (yes!) a sophomore; all had taken algebra, either in the previous semester or a year before. Most, but not all, had taken other advanced courses as well, including Real Analysis. My students were assigned problems to solve and present in class, and we developed the theory in that way. Every once in a while, I would step in and give a broader view.\n\nDid it work? Yes, it mostly did, though in the process I discovered that some aspects have to be tweaked a little bit. Because Pollatsek doesn't want to assume any algebra background, there are lots of \"check that SL(2,R) is a group\" problems — more than I or my students wanted. Because she doesn't want to assume much knowledge of topology, she does not have the chance to make much of connectedness, compactness, covering spaces, and (most significant in this context) simple connectedness. This seems like an opportunity lost.\n\nSome choices I just don't understand. Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere? (My students were fascinated.) Why work only with the one-dimensional Lorenz group? Why not have more pictures? After all, it's easy to draw pictures of the one-dimensional Lie groups.\n\nSome issues had to do with the fact that my students knew some things that her students didn't (what a group is, what a normal subgroup is) but did not have a sure grasp of some things that her students clearly do have well under control (the example that stands out in my mind is the Jacobian matrix of a differentiable map). The bibliography is also a little strange, too selective for my taste. This proved significant towards the end, when my students were working on term papers and all of them wanted the same books… which were not in our library.\n\nPollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book. Using it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing. If that applies to you, give this book a try.\n\nFernando Q.

We could express this as P = f(n,V,T). If all three are changed simultaneously, how is the pressure changed?\n\nPre-AP PreCalculus provides opportunities to study real numbers, functions and their graphs, trigonometric relationships, parametric representations, sequences, and series.

The requirements to be met are instructor availability in terms of skills/topic coverage, instructor willingness to travel certain distances and to give a certain number of courses, meet customer requirements (offer specific courses within certain time periods in certain regions), and to minimize travel cost.\n\nIn a specific implementation we managed to maximize the number of offered training courses for high school teachers across three U.S. states while observing constraints such as travel restrictions, trainer skills and availability, and course demand and frequency. The computed plans do not conflict with business and trainer constraints while the effort to come up with a workable plan was reduced from three days to an hour.\nThe problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and included approx. 75 locations, 100 instructors, 25 time slots, and 20 different courses. Depending on the specific constraints, the resulting schedule contains about 200-250 scheduled courses during the planning period of one quarter.\n\nOptimize utilization of beds in a hospital depending on total number of beds, allocations to certain departments, expected duration of the individual stays in the hospital, required safety quantities, etc. The benefits of optimization include maximized utilization of available beds, minimized waiting time, minimized bottlenecks, and increased visibility into the hospital supply chain.\n\nApart from optimizing schedules there is an endless list of other applications where using applied mathematics and in particular optimization, greatly improves profitability. Beyond more common areas like route planning, location determination in a logistics network, and commission structures in a multi-level marketing environment, here are examples of successful projects we have done:\n\nWeb-based optimal chemical formulation and blending: Upon entering a set of desired chemical and physical properties of the end product on a web page the application computes the optimal chemical formulation in terms of meeting the specifications while minimizing cost and returns the result in the user's web browser.

{"text": "Instructional\nprograms from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students\nto—\n\nA wide variety of representations can be seen in the examples in this chapter.\nBy using various representations for the \"counting rectangles\" problem\nin the \"Problem Solving\" section, students could find different solutions\nand compare them. The use of algebraic symbolism to explain a striking\ngraphical phenomenon is central to the \"string traversing tiles\" task\nin the \"Communication\" section. Representations facilitate reasoning and\nare the tools of proof: they are used to examine statistical relationships\nand to establish the validity of a builder's shortcut. They are at the\ncore of communication and support the development of understanding in\nMarta's and Nancy's work on the \"string traversing tiles\" problem. Although\nat one level the story of Mr. Robinson's class is about connections, at\nanother level it is about representation: one group of students places\ncoordinates that \"make things eeeasy,\" the class gains insights from dynamic\nrepresentations of geometric objects, and the students produce proofs\nin coordinate and Euclidean geometry. A major lesson of that story is\nthat different representations support different ways of thinking about\nand manipulating mathematical objects. An object can be better understood\nwhen viewed through multiple lenses. »\n\nIn grades 9–12, students' knowledge and use of representations should\nexpand in scope and complexity. As they study new content, for example,\nstudents will encounter many new representations for mathematical concepts.\nThey will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations.\nMuch of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate\non objects from different perspectives.\n\nIn elementary school, students most often use representations to reason about\nobjects and actions they can perceive directly. In the middle grades,\nstudents increasingly create and use mathematical representations for\nobjects that are not perceived directly, such as rational numbers or rates.\nBy high school, students are working with such increasingly abstract entities\nas functions, matrices, and equations. Using various representations of\nthese objects, students should be able to recognize common mathematical\nstructures across different contexts. For example, the sum of the first\nn odd natural numbers, the areas of square gardens, and the\ndistance traveled by a vehicle that starts at rest and accelerates at\na constant rate can be represented by functions of the form f(x) = ax2.\nThe fact that these situations can be represented by the same class of\nfunctions implies that they are alike in some fundamental mathematical\nway. Students are ready in high school to see similarity in the underlying\nstructure of mathematical objects that appear contextually different but\nwhose representations look quite similar.\n\nHigh school students should be able to create and interpret models of more-complex\nphenomena, drawn from a wider range of contexts, by identifying essential\nfeatures of a situation and by finding representations that capture mathematical\nrelationships among those features. They should recognize, for example,\nthat phenomena with periodic features often are best modeled by trigonometric\nfunctions and that population growth tends to be exponential, or logistic.\nThey will learn » to describe some real-world\nphenomena with iterative and recursive representations.\n\nConsider the graph of the concentration of CO2\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude during the period\nfrom 1986 through 1991 (see fig. 7.39) (Sarmiento 1993). Teachers might\nuse an example such as this to help students understand and interpret\nseveral aspects of representation. Students could discuss the trends in\nthe change in concentration of CO2 as\na function of time as well as latitude. Doing so would draw on their knowledge\nabout classes of functions and their ability to interpret three-dimensional\ngraphs. They should be able to see a roughly linear increase across time,\ncoupled with a sinusoidal fluctuation with the seasons. Focusing on the\nchange in the character of the graph as a function of latitude, students\nshould note that the amplitude of the sinusoidal function lessens from\nnorth to south. Students can test whether the trends they observe in the\ngraph correspond to recent theoretical work on CO2\nconcentration in the atmosphere. For example, the author of the article\nattributes the sinusoidal fluctuation to seasonal variations in the amount\nof photosynthesis taking place in the terrestrial biosphere. Students\ncould discuss the differences in amplitude across seasons in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres.\n\nFig. 7.39. A three-dimensional graph\nof the concentration of C02\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude (Adapted\nfrom Sarmiento [1993])\n\nElectronic technologies\nprovide access to problems and methods that until recently were difficult\nto explore meaningfully in high school. In order to use the technologies\neffectively, students will need to become familiar with the representations\ncommonly used in technological settings. For example, solving equations\nor multiplying matrices using a computer algebra system calls for learning\nhow to input and interpret information in formats used by the system.\nMany software tools that students might use include special icons and\nsymbols that carry particular meaning or are needed to operate the tool;\nstudents will need to learn about these representations and distinguish\nthem from the mathematical objects they are manipulating.\n\nAn important part of learning mathematics is learning to use the language, conventions,\nand representations of mathematics. Teachers should introduce students\nto conventional mathematical representations »\nand help them use those representations effectively by building\non the students' personal and idiosyncratic representations when necessary.\nIt is important for teachers to highlight ways in which different representations\nof the same objects can convey different information and to emphasize\nthe importance of selecting representations suited to the particular mathematical\ntasks at hand (Yerushalmy and Schwartz 1993; Moschkovich, Schoenfeld,\nand Arcavi 1993). For example, tables of values are often useful for quick\nreference, but they provide little information about the nature of the\nfunction represented. Consider the table in the \"Algebra\" section in this\nchapter that gives the number of minutes of daylight in Chicago every\nother day for the year 2000. The values in the table suggest that the\nfunction is initially increasing and then becomes decreasing. Knowledge\nof the context of a graph of those values suggests that the behavior is\nactually periodic. Similarly, algebraic and graphical representations\nof functions may provide different information. Some global properties\nof functions, such as asymptotic behavior or the rate of growth of a function,\nare often most readily apparent from graphs. But information about specific\naspects of a function—the exact value of f() or exact values of\nx where f(x)has a maximum or a minimum—may best\nbe determined using an algebraic representation of the function. Suppose\ng(x) is given by the equation g(x) = f(x)\n+ 1, for all x. The analytic definitions of f(x) and\ng(x) may offer the most-effective ways of computing specific\nvalues of f(x) and g(x), but graphing the function\nreveals that the \"shape\" of g(x) is precisely the same as that\nof f(x)—that the graph of g(x) is obtained by\ntranslating the graph of f(x) one unit upward.\n\nAs in all instruction, what matters is what the student sees, hears, and understands.\nOften, students interpret what teachers may consider wonderfully lucid\npresentations in ways that are very different from those their teachers\nintended (Confrey 1990; Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle 1993). Or they may\ninvent representations of content that are idiosyncratic and have personal\nmeaning but do not look at all like conventional mathematical representations\n(Confrey, 1991; Hall et al. 1989). Part of the teacher's role\nis to help students connect their personal images to more-conventional\nrepresentations. One very useful window into students' thinking is student-generated\nrepresentations. To illustrate this point, consider the following problem\n(adapted from Hughes-Hallett et al. [1994, p. 6]) that might be presented\nto a tenth-grade class:\n\nA flight from SeaTac Airport near Seattle, Washington, to LAX Airport\nin Los Angeles has to circle LAX several times before being allowed\nto land. Plot a graph of the distance of the plane from Seattle against\ntime from the moment of takeoff until landing.\n\nFig. 7.40. A representation that\na student might produce of an airplane's distance from\nits take-off point against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nThis representation indicates a number of interesting and not uncommon misunderstandings,\nin which literal features of the story (the plane flying at constant height\nor circling around the airport) are converted inappropriately into features\nof the graph (Dugdale 1993; Leinhardt, Zaslavsky, and Stein 1990).\nRepresentations of this type can provoke interesting classroom conversations,\nrevealing what the students really understand about graphing. This revelation\nputs the teacher in a better position to move the class toward a more nearly\naccurate representation, as sketched in figure 7.41.\n\nFig. 7.41. A more nearly accurate\nrepresentation of the airplane's distance from its take-off\npoint against the time from takeoff to landing", "original_score": 15.192705516296162, "segments_extracted": 14}
{"text": "So I currently teach a precalc class and new this year we are required to teach conic section.\nWe cover parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Since I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it? The book we use has a bunch of formulas, but I'm looking for a way to teach it to my students without using all the formulas so they don't have to memorize a bunch of formulas before their exam. What has worked for others?\n\nYou should be able to design good lessons directly based on the book sections. As long as you use a Pre-Calculus book you will have rich enough information available.\n\nBe sure to demonstrate the conic sections using a realistic three-dimensional model. Also use the definitions of each conic section and the distance formula to derive the equation for each conic section, and include the analytical cartesian graph for each.\n\nAs someone who not long ago learnt Conic Sections, I found the derivations of the formula much easier than remembering them. It was good to see the formulas at first but I much preferred the derivations.\n\nI was definitely going to derive the formulas using the distance formula and talk about applications. I wouldn't scratch formulas altogether, but our book has like 8 different formulas, which isn't fair to give all of them to my students if I don't give them on an exam.\n\nSomething one of my physics professors said to our class is recalled to me by this thread. He said students of today are so used to tv games, comics, etc. rather than playing with things with their hands, that they can't visualize 3d objects anymore. He was of course exaggerating. I think it quite odd if a student can't visualize what's going on with conic sections, so yes a model would be quite good. Maybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.\n\nAlso, the old books on geometry, particularly solid geometry, should be good with conic sections, so maybe go down to the library and have a look at them.\n\nAh yes, I have a fun experiment using that! You should certainly teach that!\n\nHere it goes: Dandelin was a Belgian, and some people decided to celebrate him. So what they did was the following. They made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone). And they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone. Then they would sell it to people.I always tought that it was very clever, and it was quite the financial succes too!did they then discover another, smaller, ice-cream (just like discovering another layer of chocolates when you finish the first layer!), which touched the other focus on the other side of the biscuit?", "original_score": 11.115011465075321, "segments_extracted": 9}
