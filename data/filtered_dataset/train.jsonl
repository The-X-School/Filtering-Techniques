{"text": "Math Anxiety\n\nThroughout grade school and maybe even in high school, many students felt there was no reason to take math.\n\nThese students hated math and felt they were never going to use it. There is still the tendency to think that only those who go into technical fields need math. Math teaches us to think. Math helps us to organize or thoughts, analyze information, and better understand the world around us.\n\nThere are myths about math that we have accepted as true and these tend to hold us back when it comes to learning math.\n\nSome popular myths are:\n\nFemales aren't any good at math\n\nThe majority can't do well in math because only a few people really have mathematical minds. (We are happy to get a \"C\" in math whereas we won't accept a \"C\" in English or any other subject that we like. We expect to do poorly in math).\n\nSome hints for studying math:\n\nRead your text first, before you try any problems.\n\nWrite down the theorems and definitions, read them out loud, and then rewrite them into your own words.\n\nDo a lot of problems and practice tests.\n\nDon't cram for tests. Frequent practice and review is the key to learning math. If you cram, you will be unsure of yourself. Formulas will become confused and problems will look differently.\n\nDon't keep looking in the back of your debt at the answers a. You may have the right answer but may not have done the problem correctly. b. If you have the wrong answer, it could affect your confidence and concentration.\n\nWhen you aren't sure of a problem, ask for help, but never erase your work. Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.\n\nSet aside a certain time everyday to study math.\n\nGet extra help when you need it. Come to the PLC for tutoring; ask your teacher or a classmate for help. Remember, you need to understand math; that does not mean memorizing it.\n\nBegin at the right place. If you feel that you need a review, be sure to start with a math class that begins at your level.\n\nA common story instructors hear from math students is that the students can do the work or homework and in class but when it comes down to the test, the students freeze.\n\nThe number one problem of math test anxiety is negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is when you talk yourself deeper into anxiety. You think \"what if\" or \"I can't\". You worry about finishing the test on time. You tend to concentrate on how you are feeling, on how the anxiety is affecting you instead of on the test itself.\n\nSome hints to counteract math test anxiety:\n\nConfront your anxiety by admitting that you are worried about this test. Anxiety and fear react in the body in the same way, and admitting that you re anxious relieves some of the anxiety.\n\nUse positive self-talk. Keep telling yourself that you can do this math, that you know this stuff, and that you are prepared.\n\nControl your physical self. Take a brisk walk around the classroom buildings using positive self-talk while walking. Keep your heart rate and respiration steady by doing slow, five count deep breathing exercises. Loosen tight muscles on your neck by doing shoulder rolls forward and backward. Relax legs and arms by shake outs before you walk into the classroom.\n\nFocus your attention away from yourself and towards the problem.\n\nWhen taking practice tests or working on homework, keep a diary of the kinds of thoughts you are having while working out the problems. Relate these concerns to your tutor or teacher.\n\nWhile the above suggestions will be helpful for the physical and emotional self, the following suggestions may be beneficial for the academic self.\n\nSome hints to better test taking:\n\nWrite down formulas and other memorized information directly onto the test. This eliminates the risk of forgetting or altering the information incorrectly as you work the problems.\n\nPreview the test. Find a problem you are comfortable with and start there. It is not necessary to work in numerical order. Try instead to choose an order that helps you stay positive.\n\nStart with the easier problems. Also keep in mind the total point of the test and plan a strategy to get the most amount of points possible in the shortest amount of time.\n\nPass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive. If you find yourself becoming anxious, try some relaxation techniques to calm down physically and then focus back on the test.\n\nReview the problems you've skipped. Maybe other problems you have solved can give you a better insight to the work needed for this problem.\n\nShow some work for each problem, even if it's a guess. Partial credit is still good.\n\nAllow for some time to look back over your work. Make sure you have read the directions correctly and look for careless errors.\n\nUse all of the test time. Anxiety can induce a need to escape. Try to control the anxiety before this feeling takes over. Leaving a test early may mean a loss of points on your test as well as other negative feedback. Remember, always try to remain positive.\n\nRemember, the key to conquering math anxiety is practice, practice, practice. The more confident you become in your ability, the better you will do."}

{"text": "The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\nReadership\n\nUndergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n-- Robin Hartshorne, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n-- I. Martin Isaacs, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\""}

Andrea Prosperetti draws on many years' research experience to produce a guide to a wide variety of methods, ranging from classical Fourier-type series through to the theory of distributions and basic functional analysis. Theorems are stated precisely and their meaning explained, though proofs are mostly only sketched, with comments and examples being given more prominence.

The authors argue for careful analyses of workplace activities, looking beyond the conventional thinking about numeracy, which still dominates policy arguments about workplace mathematics. Throughout their study, the authors answer the following fundamental questions:\n\nWhat mathematical knowledge and skills matter for the world of work today?\n\nHow does information technology change the necessary knowledge and the ways in which it is encountered?\n\nHow can we develop these essential new skills in the workforce?\n\nWith evidence of successful opportunities to learn with TmL that were co-designed and evaluated with employers and employees, this book provides suggestions for the development of TmL through the use of authentic learning activities, and interactive software design. Essential reading for trainers and managers in industry, teachers, researchers and lecturers of mathematics education, and stakeholders implementing evidence-based policy, this book maps the fundamental changes taking place in workplace mathematics.\n\nContents\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n1.

{"text": "Discovering Geometry Intro\n\nDiscovering Geometry began in my classroom over 35 years ago. During my first ten years of teaching I did not use a textbook, but created my own daily lesson plans and classroom management system. I believe students learn with greater depth of understanding when they are actively engaged in the process of discovering concepts and we should delay the introduction of proof in geometry until students are ready. Until Discovering Geometry, no textbook followed that philosophy.\n\nI was also involved in a Research In Industry grant where I repeatedly heard that the skills valued in all working environments were the ability to express ideas verbally and in writing, and the ability to work as part of a team. I wanted my students to be engaged daily in doing mathematics and exchanging ideas in small cooperative groups.\n\nThe fourth edition of Discovering Geometry includes new hands-on techniques, curriculum research, and technologies that enhance my vision of the ideal geometry class. I send my heartfelt appreciation to the many teachers who contributed their feedback during classroom use. Their students and future students will help continue the evolution of Discovering Geometry."}

{"text": "Post navigation\n\nReading Math\n\nMy Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I don't want them reading math. Kids are never taught to \"read\" a math textbook. If they ever do approach a math textbook, they approach it like a history book. The read it linearly. They also read it passively. Their eyes glaze over. They read words, but they don't try to connect the words to the equations or pictures. They don't read with a pencil in their hands. They hope for some Divine Knowledge to descend upon them simply by having the book open and their eyes on it.\n\nThat doesn't work. We all know this. Reading math is an active thing.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nFor question A, some representative responses:\n\n\"I read what was assigned to me but did not read anything extra.\"\n\"I find that textbook reading is pretty boring, so I don't do it unless I have to.\"\n\"I did not because I had assumed I wouldn't learn things I needed. All I would do was look at examples.\"\n\"No, I find it difficult to understand math when reading it in paragraphs; it makes more sense to me with a teacher.\"\n\"I did not generally read my math textbooks. I did, however, always look over the example problems.\"\n\nSome responses for Question B:\n\n1. The writing can be confusing, wordy, and not thorough\n2. The book is BORING\n3. Small print\n4. Too many words for math\n5. Outdated examples\n\nSome responses for Question C\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math\u2026 READING MATH!\n\nPost navigation\n\n3 thoughts on \"Reading Math\"\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books\u2014he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson."}

{"text": "Syllabus Structure and Content\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe way in which the mathematical content in the syllabuses is organised and presented in the syllabus document is described in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Section 3.3 also discusses the main alterations, both in content and in emphasis, with respect to the preceding versions. The forthcoming changes in the primary curriculum, which will have \"knock-on\" effects at second level, are outlined in Section 3.4. Finally, in Section 3.5, the content is related to the aims of the syllabuses.\n\n3.2 STRUCTURE\n\nFor the Higher and Ordinary level syllabuses, the mathematical material forming the content is divided into eight sections, as follows:\n\nSets\n\nNumber systems\n\nApplied arithmetic and measure\n\nAlgebra\n\nStatistics\n\nGeometry\n\nTrigonometry\n\nFunctions and graphs\n\nThe corresponding material for the Foundation level syllabus is divided into seven sections; there are minor differences in the sequence and headings, resulting in the following list:\n\nSets\n\nNumber systems\n\nApplied arithmetic and measure\n\nStatistics and data handling\n\nAlgebra\n\nRelations, functions and graphs\n\nGeometry\n\nThe listing by content area is intended to give mathematical coherence to the syllabuses, and to help teachers locate specific topics (or check that topics are not listed). The content areas are reasonably distinct, indicating topics with different historical roots and different main areas of application. However, they are inter-related and interdependent, and it is not intended that topics would be dealt with in total isolation from each other. Also, while the seven or eight areas, and the contents within each area, are presented in a logical sequence \u00ad combining, as far as possible, a sensible mathematical order with a developmental one for learners \u00ad it is envisaged that many content areas listed later in the syllabus would be introduced before or alongside those listed earlier. (For example, geometry appears near the end of the list, but the course committee specifically recommends that introductory geometrical work is started in First Year, allowing plenty of time for the ideas to be developed in a concrete way, and thoroughly understood, before the more abstract elements are introduced.) However, the different order of listing for the Foundation level syllabus does reflect a suggestion that the introduction of some topics (notably formal algebra) might be delayed. Some of these points are taken up in Section 4.\n\nAppropriate pacing of the syllabus content over the three years of the junior cycle is a challenge. Decisions have to be made at class or school level. Some of the factors affecting the decisions are addressed in these Guidelines in Section 4, under the heading of planning and organisation.\n\n3.3 SYLLABUS CONTENT\n\nThe contents of the Higher, Ordinary and Foundation level syllabuses are set out in the corresponding sections of the syllabus document. In each case, the content is presented in the two-column format used for the Leaving Certificate syllabuses introduced in the 1990s, with the lefthand column listing the topics and the right-hand column adding notes (for instance, providing illustrative examples, or highlighting specific aspects of the topics which are included or excluded). Further illustration of the depth of treatment of topics is given in Section 5 (in dealing with assessment) and in the proposed sample assessmentmaterials (available separately).\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nAs indicated in Section 1, the revisions deal only with specific problems in the previous syllabuses, and do not reflect a root-and-branch review of the mathematics education appropriate for students in the junior cycle. The main changes in content, addressing the problems identified in Section 1, are described below. A summary ofall the changes is provided in Appendix 1.\n\nCalculators and calculator-related techniques\n\nAs pointed out in the introduction to each syllabus, calculators are assumed to be readily available for appropriate use, both as teaching/learning tools and as computational aids; they will also be allowed in examinations.\n\nThe concept of \"appropriate\" use is crucial here. Calculators are part of the modern world, and students need to be able to use them efficiently where and when required. Equally, students need to retain and develop their feel for number, while the execution of mental calculations, for instance to make estimates, becomes even more important than it was heretofore. Estimation, which was not mentioned in the 1987 syllabus (though it was covered in part by the phrase \"the practice of approximating before evaluating\"), now appears explicitly and will be tested in examinations.\n\nThe importance of the changes in this area is reflected in two developments. First, a set of guidelines on calculators is being produced. It addresses issues such as the purchase of suitable machines as well as the rationale for their use. Secondly, in 1999 the Department of Education and Science commissioned a research project to monitor numeracy-related skills (with and without calculators) over the period of introduction of the revised syllabuses. If basic numeracy and mental arithmetic skills are found to disimprove, remedial action may have to be taken. It is worth noting that research has not so far isolated any consistent association between calculator use in an education system and performance by students from that system in international tests of achievement.\n\nMathematical tables are not mentioned in the content sections of the syllabus, except for a brief reference indicating that they are assumed to be available, likewise for appropriate use. Teachers and students can still avail of them as learning tools and for reference if they so wish. Tables will continue to be available in examinations, but questions will not specifically require students to use them.\n\nGeometry\n\nThe approach to synthetic geometry was one of the major areas which had to be confronted in revising the syllabuses. Evidence from examination scripts suggested that in many cases the presentation in the 1987 syllabus was not being followed in the classroom. In particular, in the Higher level syllabus, the sequence of proofs and intended proof methods were being adapted. Teachers were responding to students' difficulties in coping with the approach that attempted to integrate transformational concepts with those more traditionally associated with synthetic geometry, as described in Section 1.1 of these Guidelines.\n\nFor years, and all over the world, there have been difficulties in deciding how \u00ad indeed, whether \u00ad to present synthetic geometry and concepts of logical proof to students of junior cycle standing. Their historical importance, and their role as guardians of one of the defining aspects of mathematics as a discipline, have led to a wish to retain them in the Irish mathematics syllabuses; but the demands made on students who have not yet reached the Piagetian stage of formal operations are immense. \"Too much, too soon\" not only contravenes the principle of learnability (section 2.5), but leads to rote learning and hence failure to attain the objectives which the geometry sections of the syllabuses are meant to address. The constraints of a minor revision precluded the question of \"whether\" from being asked on this occasion. The question of \"how\" raises issues to do with the principles of soundness versus learnability. The resulting formulation set out in the syllabus does not claim to be a full description of a geometrical system. Rather, it is intended to provide a defensible teaching sequence that will allow students to learn geometry meaningfully and to come to realise the power of proof. Some of the issues that this raises are discussed in Appendix 2.\n\nThe revised version can be summarised as follows.\n\nThe approach omits the transformational elements, returning to a more traditional approach based on congruency.\n\nIn the interests of consistency and transfer between levels, the underlying ideas are basically the same across all three syllabuses, though naturally they are developed to very different levels in the different syllabuses.\n\nThe system has been carefully formulated to display the power of logical argument at a level which \u00ad hopefully \u00ad students can follow and appreciate. It is therefore strongly recommended that, in the classroom, material is introduced in the sequence in which it is listed in the syllabus document. For theHigher level syllabus, the concepts of logicalargument and rigorous proof are particularlyimportant. Thus, in examinations, attempted proofsthat presuppose \"later\" material in order to establish\"earlier\" results will be penalised. Moreover, proofsusing transformations will not be accepted.\n\nTo shorten the Higher level syllabus, only some of the theorems have been designated as ones for which students may be asked to supply proofs in the examinations. The other theorems should still beproved as part of the learning process;students should be able to follow the logical development, and see models of far more proofs than they are expected to reproduce at speed under examination conditions. The required saving of time is expected to occur because students do not have to put in the extra effort needed to develop fluency in writing out particular proofs.\n\nStudents taking the Ordinary and (a fortiori)Foundation level syllabuses are not required to prove theorems, but \u00ad in accordance with the level-specific aims (Section 2.4) \u00ad should experience the logical reasoning involved in ways in which they can understand it. The general thrust of the synthetic geometry section of the syllabuses for these students is not changed from the 1987 versions.\n\nIt may be noted that the formulation of the Foundation level syllabus in 1987 emphasised the learning process rather than the product or outcomes. In the current version, the teaching/learning suggestions are presented in theseGuidelines (chiefly in Section 4), not in the syllabus document. It is important to emphasise that the changed formulation in the syllabus is not meant to point to a more formal presentation than previously suggested for Foundation level students.\n\nSection 4.9 of this document contains a variety of suggestions as to how the teaching of synthetic geometry to junior cycle students might be addressed.\n\nTransformation geometry still figures in the syllabuses, but is treated separately from the formal development of synthetic geometry. The approach is intended to be intuitive, helping students to develop their visual and spatial ability. There are opportunities here to build on the work on symmetry in the primary curriculum and to develop aesthetic appreciation of mathematical patterns.\n\nOther changes to the Higher level syllabus\n\nLogarithms are removed. Their practical role as aids to calculation is outdated; the theory of logarithms is sufficiently abstract to belong more comfortably to the senior cycle.\n\nMany topics are \"pruned\" in order to shorten the syllabus.\n\nOther changes to the Ordinary level syllabus\n\nThe more conceptually difficult areas of algebra and coordinate geometry are simplified.\n\nA number of other topics are \"pruned\".\n\nOther changes to the Foundation level syllabus\n\nThere is less emphasis on fractions but rather more on decimals. (The change was introduced partly because of the availability of calculators \u00ad though, increasingly, calculators have buttons and routines which allow fractions to be handled in a comparatively easy way.)\n\nThe coverage of statistics and data handling is increased. These topics can easily be related to students' everyday lives, and so can help students to recognise the relevance of mathematics. They lend themselves also to active learning methods (such as those presented in Section 4) and the use of spatial as well as computational abilities. Altogether, therefore, the topics provide great scope for enhancing students' enjoyment and appreciation of mathematics. They also give opportunities for developing suitably concrete approaches to some of the more abstract material, notably algebra and functions (see Section 4.8).\n\nThe algebra section is slightly expanded. The formal algebraic content of the 1987 syllabus was so slight that students may not have had scope to develop their understanding; alternatively, teachers may have chosen to omit the topic. The rationale for the present adjustment might be described as \"use it or lose it\". The hope is that the students will be able to use it, and that \u00ad suitably addressed \u00ad it can help them in making some small steps towards the more abstract mathematics which they may need to encounter later in the course of their education.\n\nOverall, therefore, it is hoped that the balance between the syllabuses is improved. In particular, the Ordinary level syllabus may be better positioned between a more accessible Higher level and a slightly expanded Foundation level.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nThe brief for revision of the syllabuses, as described in Section 1.2, precluded a root-and-branch reconsideration of their style and content. However, it did allow for some changes in emphasis: or rather, in certain cases, for some of the intended emphases to be made more explicit and more clearly related to rationale, content, assessment, and \u00ad via the Guidelines \u00ad methodology. The changes in, or clarification of, emphasis refer in particular to the following areas.\n\nUnderstanding\n\nGeneral objectives B and C of the syllabus refer respectively to instrumental understanding (knowing \"what\" to do or \"how\" to do it, and hence being able to execute procedures) and relational understanding (knowing \"why\", understanding the concepts of mathematics and the way in which they connect with each other to form so-called \"conceptual structures\"). When people talk of teaching mathematics for \u00ad or learning it with \u00ad understanding, they usually mean relational understanding. The language used in the Irish syllabuses to categorise understanding is that of Skemp; the objectives could equally well have been formulated in terms of \"procedures\" and \"concepts\".\n\nResearch points to the importance of both kinds of understanding, together with knowledge of facts (general objective A), as components of mathematical proficiency, with relational understanding being crucial for retaining and applying knowledge. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, indicated that Irish teachers regard knowledge of facts and procedures as particularly important \u00ad unusually so in international terms; but it would appear that less heed is paid to conceptual/relational understanding. This is therefore given special emphasis in the revised syllabuses. Such understanding can be fostered by active learning, as described and illustrated in Section 4. Ways in which relational understanding can be assessed are considered in Section 5.\n\nCommunication\n\nGeneral objective H of the syllabus indicates that students should be able to communicate mathematics, both verbally and in written form, by describing and explaining the mathematical procedures they undertake and by explaining their findings and justifying their conclusions. This highlights the importance of students expressing mathematics in their own words. It is one way of promoting understanding; it may also help students to take ownership of the findings they defend, and so to be more interested in their mathematics and more motivated to learn.\n\nThe importance of discussion as a tool for ongoing assessment of students' understanding is highlighted in Section 5.2. In the context of examinations, the ability to show different stages in a procedure, explain results, give reasons for conclusions, and so forth, can be tested; some examples are given in Section 5.6.\n\nAppreciation and enjoyment\n\nGeneral objective I of the syllabus refers to appreciating mathematics. As pointed out earlier, appreciation may develop for a number of reasons, from being able to do the work successfully to responding to the abstract beauty of the subject. It is more likely to develop, however, when the mathematics lessons themselves are pleasant occasions.\n\nIn drawing up the revised syllabus and preparing the Guidelines, care has been taken to include opportunities for making the teaching and learning of mathematics more enjoyable. Enjoyment is good in its own right; also, it can develop students' motivation and hence enhance learning. For many students in the junior cycle, enjoyment (as well as understanding) can be promoted by the active learning referred to above and by placing the work in appropriate meaningful contexts. Section 4 contains many examples of enjoyable classroom activities which promote both learning and appreciation of mathematics. Teachers are likely to have their own battery of such activities which work for them and their classes. It is hoped that these can be shared amongst their colleagues and perhaps submitted for inclusion in the final version of the Guidelines.\n\nOf course, different people enjoy different kinds of mathematical activity. Appreciation and enjoyment do not come solely from \"games\"; more traditional classrooms also can be lively places in which teachers and students collaborate in the teaching and learning of mathematics and develop their appreciation of the subject. Teachers will choose approaches with whichthey themselves feel comfortable and which meet thelearning needs of the students whom they teach.\n\nThe changed or clarified emphasis in the syllabuses will be supported, where possible, by corresponding adjustments to the formulation and marking of Junior Certificate examination questions. While the wording ofquestions may be the same, the expected solutions may bedifferent. Examples are given in Section 5.\n\n3.4 CHANGES IN THE PRIMARY CURRICULUM\n\nThe changes in content and emphasis within the revised Junior Certificate mathematics syllabuses are intended, inter alia, to follow on from and build on the changes in the primary curriculum. The forthcoming alterations (scheduled to be introduced in 2002, but perhaps starting earlier in some classrooms, as teachers may anticipate the formal introduction of the changes) will affect the knowledge and attitudes that students bring to their second level education. Second level teachers need to be prepared for this. A summary of the chief alterations is given below; teachers are referred to the revised Primary School Curriculum for further details.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nIn the revised curriculum, the main changes of emphasis are as follows.\n\nThere is more emphasis on\n\nsetting the work in real-life contexts\n\nlearning through hands-on activities (using concrete materials/manipulatives, and so forth)\n\nunderstanding (in particular, gaining appropriaterelational understanding as well as instrumentalunderstanding)\n\nappropriate use of mathematical language\n\nrecording\n\nproblem-solving.\n\nThere is less emphasis on\n\nlearning routine procedures with no context provided\n\ndoing complicated calculations.\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nThe changes in emphasis are reflected in changes to the content, the main ones being as follows.\n\nNew areas include\n\nintroduction of the calculator from Fourth Class (augmenting, not replacing, paper-and-pencil techniques)\n\n(hence) extended treatment of estimation;\n\nincreased coverage of data handling\n\nintroduction of basic probability (\"chance\").\n\nNew terminology includes\n\nthe use of the \"positive\" and \"negative\" signs for denoting a number (as in +3 [positive three], -6 [negative six] as well as the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" signs for denoting an operation (as in 7 + 3, 24 \u00ad 9)\n\nexplicit use of the multiplication sign in formulae (as in 2 \u00d7r, l \u00d7w).\n\nThe treatment of subtraction emphasises the \"renaming\" or \"decomposition\" method (as opposed to the \"equal additions\" method \u00ad the one which uses the terminology \"paying back\") even more strongly than does the 1971 curriculum. Use of the word \"borrowing\" is discouraged.\n\nThe following topics are among those excluded from the revised curriculum:\n\nunrestricted calculations (thus, division is restricted to at most four-digit numbers being divided by at most two-digit numbers, and \u00ad for fractions \u00ad to division of whole numbers by unit fractions)\n\n(Some of these topics were not formally included in the 1971 curriculum, but appeared in textbooks and were taught in many classrooms.)\n\nNOTE\n\nThe reductions in content have removed some areas of overlap between the 1971 Primary School Curriculum and the Junior Certificate syllabuses. Some overlap remains, however. This is natural; students entering second level schooling need to revise the concepts and techniques that they have learnt at primary level, and also need to situate these in the context of their work in the junior cycle.\n\n3.5 LINKING CONTENT AREAS WITH AIMS\n\nFinally, in this section, the content of the syllabuses is related to the aims and objectives. In fact most aims and objectives can be addressed in most areas of the syllabuses. However, some topics are more suited to the attainment of certain goals or the development of certain skills than are others. The discussion below highlights some of the main possibilities, and points to the goals that might appropriately be emphasised when various topics are taught and learnt. Phrases italicised are quoted or paraphrased from the aims as set out in the syllabus document. Section 5 of these Guidelines indicates a variety of ways in which achievement of the relevant objectives might be encouraged, tested or demonstrated.\n\nSETS\n\nSets provide a conceptual foundation for mathematics and a language by means of which mathematical ideas can be discussed. While this is perhaps the main reason for which set theory was introduced into school mathematics, its importance at junior cycle level can be described rather differently.\n\nSet problems, obviously, call for skills of problem-solving; in particular, they provide occasions for logical argument. By using data gathered from the class, they even offer opportunities for simple introduction to mathematical modelling in contexts to which the students can relate.\n\nMoreover, set theory emphasises aspects of mathematics that are not purely computational. Sets are about classification, hence about tidiness and organisation. This can lead toappreciation of mathematics on aesthetic grounds and can help to provide a basis forfurther education in the subject.\n\nAn additional point is that this topic is not part of the Primary School Curriculum, and so represents a new start, untainted by previous failure. For some students, therefore, there are particularly important opportunities for personal development.\n\nNUMBER SYSTEMS\n\nWhile mathematics is not entirely quantitative, numeracy is one of its most important aspects. Students have been building up their concepts of numbers from a very early stage in their lives. However, moving from familiarity with natural numbers (and simple operations on them) to genuine understanding of the various forms in which numbers are presented and of the uses to which they are put in the world is a considerable challenge.\n\nWeakness in this area destroys students' confidence andcompetence by depriving them of theknowledge, skillsand understanding needed for continuing theireducation and for life and work. It therefore handicaps their personal fulfilment and hencepersonaldevelopment.\n\nThe aspect of \"understanding\" is particularly important \u00ad or, perhaps, has had its importance highlighted \u00ad with advances in technology.\n\nStudents need to become familiar with the intelligent and appropriate use of calculators, while avoiding dependence on the calculators for simple calculations.\n\nComplementing this, they need to develop skills in estimation and approximation, so that numbers can be used meaningfully.\n\nAPPLIED ARITHMETIC AND MEASURE\n\nThis topic is perhaps one of the easiest to justify in terms of providing mathematics needed for life, workand leisure.\n\nStudents are likely to use the skills developed here in \"everyday\" applications, for example in looking after their personal finances and in structuring the immediate environment in which they will live. For many, therefore, this may be a key section in enabling studentsto develop a positive attitude towards mathematics as avaluable subject of study.\n\nThere are many opportunities for problem-solving, hopefully in contexts that the students recognise as relevant.\n\nThe availability of calculators may remove some of the drudgery that can be associated with realistic problems, helping the students to focus on the concepts and applications that bring the topics to life.\n\nALGEBRA\n\nAlgebra was developed because it was needed \u00ad because arguments in natural language were too clumsy or imprecise. It has become one of the most fundamental tools for mathematics.\n\nAs with number, therefore, confidence andcompetence are very important. Lack of these underminethepersonal development of the students by depriving them of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed forcontinuing their education and for life and work.\n\nWithout skills in algebra, students lack the technical preparation for study of other subjects in school, and in particular their foundation for appropriate studies lateron \u00ad including further education in mathematics itself.\n\nIt is thus particularly important that students develop appropriate understanding of the basics of algebra so that algebraic techniques are carried out meaningfully and not just as an exercise in symbol-pushing.\n\nEspecially for weaker students, this can be very challenging because algebra involves abstractions andgeneralisations.\n\nHowever, these characteristics are among the strengths and beauties of the topic. Appropriately used, algebra can enhance the students' powers of communication, facilitate simplemodelling and problem-solving, and hence illustrate the power of mathematics as a valuablesubject of study.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nOne of the ways in which the world is interpreted for us mathematically is by the use of statistics. Their prevalence, in particular on television and in the newspapers, makes them part of the environment in which children grow up, and provides students with opportunities for recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nMany of the examples refer to the students' typical areas of interest; examples include sporting averages and trends in purchases of (say) CDs.\n\nStudents can provide data for further examples from their own backgrounds and experiences.\n\nPresenting these data graphically can extend students'powers of communication and their ability to shareideas with other people, and may also provide anaesthetic element.\n\nThe fact that statistics can help to develop a positiveattitude towards mathematics as an interesting andvaluable subject of study \u00ad even for weaker students who find it hard to appreciate the more abstract aspects of the subject \u00ad explains the extra prominence given to aspects of data handling in the Foundation level syllabus, as mentioned earlier. They may be particularly important in promotingconfidence and competence in both numerical and spatial domains.\n\nGEOMETRY\n\nThe study of geometry builds on the primary school study of shape and space, and hence relates to mathematics in the world around us. In the junior cycle, different approaches to geometry address different educational goals.\n\nMore able students address one of the greatest of mathematical concepts, that of proof, and hopefully come to appreciate theabstractions andgeneralisations involved.\n\nOther students may not consider formal proof, but should be able to draw appropriate conclusions from given geometrical data.\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nExplaining and defending their findings, in either case, should help students to further their powersof communication.\n\nTackling \"cuts\" and other exercises based on the geometrical system presented in the syllabus allows students to develop their problem-solving skills.\n\nMoreover, in studying synthetic geometry, students are encountering one of the great monuments to intellectual endeavour: a very special part of Western culture.\n\nTransformation geometry builds on the study of symmetry at primary level. As the approach to transformation geometry in the revised Junior Certificate syllabus is intuitive, it is included in particular for its aesthetic value.\n\nWith the possibility of using transformations in artistic designs, it allows students to encounter creative aspectsof mathematics and to develop or exercise their own creative skills.\n\nIt can also develop their spatial ability, hopefully promotingconfidence and competence in this area.\n\nInstances of various types of symmetry in the natural and constructed environment give scope for students' recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nCoordinate geometry links geometrical and algebraic ideas. On the one hand, algebraic techniques can be used to establish geometric results; on the other, algebraic entities are given pictorial representations.\n\nIts connections with functions and trigonometry, as well as algebra and geometry, make it a powerful tool for the integration of mathematics into a unified structure.\n\nIt illustrates the power of mathematics, and so helps to establish it with students as a valuable subject of study.\n\nIt provides an important foundation for appropriatestudies later on.\n\nThe graphical aspect can add a visually aestheticdimension to algebra.\n\nTRIGONOMETRY\n\nTrigonometry is a subject that has its roots in antiquity but is still of great practical use to-day. While its basic concepts are abstract, they can be addressed through practical activities.\n\nSituations to which it can be applied \u00ad for example, house construction, navigation, and various ball games \u00ad include many that are relevant to the students' life, work and leisure.\n\nIt can therefore promote the students' recognition andenjoyment of mathematics in the world around them.\n\nWith the availability of calculators, students may more easily develop competence and confidence through their work in this area.\n\nFUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS\n\nThe concept of a function is crucial in mathematics, and students need a good grasp of it in order to prepare a firm foundation for appropriate studies lateron and in particular, a basis for further education inmathematics itself.\n\nThe representation of functions by graphs adds a pictorial element that students may find aesthetic as well as enhancing their understanding and their abilityto handle generalisations.\n\nThis topic pulls together much of the groundwork done elsewhere, using the tools introduced and skills developed in earlier sections and providing opportunities forproblem-solving and simple modelling.\n\nFor Foundation students alone, simple work on the set-theoretic treatment of relations has been retained. In contexts that can be addressed by those whose numerical skills are poor, it provides exercises in simple logical thinking.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe foregoing argument presents just one vision of the rationale for including the various topics in the syllabus and for the ways in which the aims of the mathematics syllabus can be achieved. All teachers will have their own ideas about what can inspire and inform different topic areas. Their own personal visions of mathematics, and their particular areas of interest and expertise, may lead them to implement the aims very differently from the way that is suggested here. Visions can profitably be debated at teachers' meetings, with new insights being given and received as a result.\n\nThe tentative answers given here with regard to whycertain topics are included in the syllabus are, of course, offered to teachers rather than junior cycle students. In some cases, students also may find the arguments relevant. In other cases, however, the formulation is too abstract or the benefit too distant to be of interest. This, naturally, can cause problems. Clearly it would not be appropriate to reduce the syllabus to material that has immediately obvious applications in the students' everyday lives. This would leave them unprepared for further study, and would deprive them of sharing parts of our culture; in any case, not all students are motivated by supposedly everyday topics.\n\nTeachers are therefore faced with a challenging task in helping students find interest and meaning in all parts of the work. Many suggestions with proven track records in Irish schools are offered in Section 4. As indicated earlier, it is hoped that teachers will offer more ideas for an updated version of the Guidelines."}

{"text": "What to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nWhat to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nSo I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nDifferential Geometry\nmathematics of Fluid Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Field Theory\nmathematics of General Relativity\n\nIf you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,\n\nAs many courses in real analysis as possible\nAs many courses in statistics, probability.\na second course in numerical analysis.\na course in nonlinear optimization\na course in mathematical theory of finance.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory. So I think overall topology is a good idea if you wanna go for mathematical physics."}

Pre calculus is a topic which comes from the study of motion. It deals with different ideas, areas and volumes, rates of change, the orbits of planets, and infinite sequences.\nPre calculus consists of those subjects, skills, and insights which are necessary to recognize calculus. It involves arithmetic, algebra, coordinate Geometry, trigonometry, and, functions. In Pre calculus we study many different type of topics which includes, sets, real numbers, complex numbers, composite and polynomial Functions, trigonometry, limits, vectors, metrics, binomial theorem, and many other topics. Let's understand few basic topic of pre calculus.\nSet: - We know that Set is a collection of different type of objects which are defined in proper manner. Different types of operation are present in the set that are Union, intersection, complements and Cardinality product. Sets are of different type like Empty set, Universal set, etc.\nIf no element is available in the set then it is known as empty set, and the Sets are present in the universe of conversation are universal set.\nEmpty set is denoted by the symbol '\u2205' and universal set is denoted by 'U'\nReal number: - In the Real Numbers all the Rational and Irrational Numbers and whole numbers are present.\nFor example: Whole numbers are (1, 4, 6, 8, 10). Sometime the number 0 is also involved in Whole Number.\nRational number \u2013 The Rational Numbers are 3/5, 0.16, 0.33\u20262.2 etc.\nIrrational number \u2013 Irrational numbers are (\u22bc, \u221a 3) etc.\nIf we have \u221a -3, this number is not considered in the category of real number because it contains imaginary value and '\u221e' and it is not a real number.\nThis is a brief introduction to Precalculus in which we come across few Basic Terms of pre calculus."}

Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. SuzukiFALL 2010 V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Bailey (Anthropology) syllabus An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. HawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology) syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.\n\nTexts and Ideas\n\nNote: Previously listed as Conversations of the West\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Spectatorship\u2014Ethics, Politics, Aesthetics Prof. Harries (English) syllabus Are you responsible for what you see? Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Throughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds. These thinkers will, in turn, challenge us to think about the function of images in the present. Readings and films: Plato's Republic, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Rousseau's Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What do we need to function as citizens of a democracy--capacities of reason, imagination, or eloquence? Skills in analyzing public discourse or habits of historical memory? Is belief in God required, or particular emotional tendencies or sympathies? What kind of humanistic values, if any, can and should a democracy promote? We examine these questions on the assumption that intensive close reading (and listening, in Mozart's case) promotes the habits of engaged, articulate talking and writing that are the bedrock of civic education. Music of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Bolduc (French) syllabus Explores how books give shape, meaning, and purpose to the world and human experience. As it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed. Grouped under four main themes--epic and the human experience, tales of beginnings and ends, battles for truth, writings of the self--we consider the purpose of this conversation between writers of different epochs and its relevance for understanding our own culture. Reading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Garrett (Philosophy) syllabus All animals live, but only human beings consider how to live; and only reflective human beings deliberate among different ways to decide how to live. Should one look for guidance to tradition, to religion, to the state, to nature, to feeling, to reason? Versions of this question were raised and addressed repeatedly and with urgency in both Antiquity and the Enlightenment. We examine some of the most important and influential attempts to answer it and some of the dialogue that such attempts have had with one another. Readings include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Greek tragedy and philosophy, Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Wollstonecraft.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Calhoun (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, faith, ethics, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way.\n\nNote: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.\n\nNote: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative and Western Thought Prof. Weiler (Law) syllabus Issue of justice and injustice and other normative concerns. Each week pairs a core reading from the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament with another work in the Western tradition to explore a broad range of complex normative issues. Often God will be \"on trial:\" Was the Deluge genocide? Is Abraham guilty of attempted murder and child abuse? Was Jesus guilty as charged? Was Socrates? The themes are all of relevance to contemporary issues: communal responsibility vs. individual autonomy, ecological crisis, ethics vs. religion, freedom of speech and thought, genocide, rule of law and civil disobedience, the Other, punishment and retribution, religious intolerance, sanctity of human life, sex and gender. The course will be taught at the Law School in Law School style\u2014rigourous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Primary readings include: Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology; Xenophon's Apology; Sophocles' Antigone; selections from Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Kierkegaard, Mill, Thoreau, Kafka, Camus.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Free Will in Western Thought Prof. Krabbenhoft (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus The freedom of the human will has been a foundational premise of Western civilization from the early centuries of the Christian era to the present, and yet it has been questioned and even rejected by some of the most influential thinkers of the modern period. We look at the sources of the modern debate in passages from the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, in key texts by Augustine, Luther, and Erasmus, and in the shift toward a deontological view in Kant, Schopenhauer, and nineteenth-century materialism. From this historical overview we move to contemporary theories of freedom and determinism, as well as a discussion of the intersection of neuroscience and the philosophy of free will, and read a number of literary texts in the light of theory: Sophocles' Philoctetes, Tirso de Molina's Trickster of Seville, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Literature in Wonderland Prof. Momma (English) syllabus How to Play with Language: We use language every day, and yet we do not seem to know exactly how it works. Communicating with others through language sometimes feels like playing a game. But does this mean we have only one language game to play, or that we follow only one set of rules all the time? Just like Alice, who was constantly frustrated by the logic of the inhabitants of Wonderland, we are often baffled by difficulties in communicating even the simplest idea. We explore issues on language that may be raised by reading literary and philosophical texts written by \"language-conscious\" authors: Is language the only way to communicate? Do we know anything about the origin of language? Do grammar and rhetoric help us communicate well or persuade others? Do etymology and the history of English tell us anything new about the language we know already? Do our minds work exactly the same way regardless of the language we speak? How do we do things with words? Readings: Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Plato's Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Beowulf, Chaucer's House of Fame, Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Borges' Library of Babel, Achebe's Things Fall Apart.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom\u2014freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind\u2014as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Mortal and Immortal Questions Professor Mitsis (Classics) syllabus A wide-ranging selection of works that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about the nature of religion, the successes and failures of rational argument, the justification of social and political obligations, the benefits and dangers of technology and scientific knowledge, and the value of emotions and our attachments to others. Throughout the semester, students have the opportunity to become more practiced in formulating moral, political, and aesthetic arguments and in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude, that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death--or, perhaps, worse, faced with eternal life. Readings: Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Epicureans, Stoics, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Augustine, Teresa of Avila, Hume, d'Holbach, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Tolstoy, Freud, Proust.\n\nSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition\u2014science and technology\u2014rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French) syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\"\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology) syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nCultures and Contexts\n\nNote: Previously listed as World Cultures\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978\u201379 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some 60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0506 Cultures and Contexts: Chinese and Japanese Traditions Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus Essential aspects of Asian culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism\u2014studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0509 Cultures and Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0515 Cultures and Contexts: Latin America Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus Spanish, African, and Amerindian Sources of Latin American Identities. Explores the emergence of contemporary Latin America through the past and present doings of its persons and their representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature. Through in-depth treatment of selected cases, and via the perspectives of history, anthropology, and cultural criticism, focusing on texts but also film, dance, music, and performance, the aims is both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness (and of global modernity) in the historical confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national integration. At base, we seek to answer more fundamental questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of so-called globalization? Includes frank and explicit discussion of race, sex, and religion.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus A range of intersecting questions concerning the African Diaspora and what it produces: What does the trans-Atlantic slave trade create in the early modern and modern world? How is our understanding of trade, culture, capitalism, justice, race, gender, and work shaped by the histories of dispersal that characterize the Atlantic World? What aspects of culture, politics, identity, and social formations are illuminated when we think critically about the African Diaspora and the forces that propel it?\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian Pacific American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions-films, literature, art, media, and popular culture.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish & Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Morris (ISAWFALL 2010 V55.0546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Hull (History) syllabus Focuses on several major African cultures that influenced each other's development from the pre-colonial through the postcolonial eras. These multi-dimensional cultures are examined through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, and museum artifacts, with emphasis on concepts of cultural identity and interchange, modernization, and cosmopolitanism. Africa is examined not only within the context of indigenous cultures but within the context of the world at large. In this vein, we weigh the contributions African cultures made to each other but also to the wider world.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Beidelman (Anthropology) syllabus Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0507 Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Solt (History) syllabus Postwar Japan, 1945 to Present. An inquiry into Japan's social, political, and economic transformation since World War II. Examines the role of the Cold War, the U.S. Occupation, the \"Peace\" Constitution, the symbolic monarchy, the economic \"miracle,\" corporate structure, the gendering of labor, and the legacy of war in shaping the history of postwar Japan. An underlying theme is the connection between political economy and culture. As such, we focus on the geopolitical and economic structures underpinning the visible transformations in everyday life and try to connect these transformations in Japanese history to broader themes in global history.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0510 Cultures and Contexts: Russia\u2014between East and West Prof. Borenstein (Russian & Slavic Studies)syllabus What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West), or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very beginnings to the present day.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0512 Cultures and Contexts: China Prof. Button (East Asian Studies) syllabus However one might choose to define the nature of human being, no one is ever merely human. Apart from whatever common essence we may be said to share, we are always also a combination of racial, ethnic, national, and gender differences. Over the course of several millennia Chinese culture has produced different conceptions of human being. We explore the variety of ways those conceptions have changed over time. Central to our inquiry is the question of how contending visions of the human are expressed and contested in different kinds of philosophical and literary texts, as well as artistic works in other media, including visual culture and film. Our guiding focus is on how ideas about human being in China have shaped gender roles and relations, the discourses of spirituality and the supernatural, as well as modern problems of race, nationalism, and revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0516 Cultures and Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology) syllabus Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Rosaldo and Prof. Gaytan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Addresses immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, testimonials, identities, popular culture, and language. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws on readings from imaginative literature to social science, we explore Latino communities in the United States and the issues that divide and unite them.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0533 Cultures and Contexts: Iran Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran: For 2500 years, the culture and civilization of Iran, (known in the West prior to World War II as Persia), has survived innumerable attacks and vicissitudes, which swept away many other cultures, languages, and nations. The first empire in human history to be multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious, based on tolerance, expanded ultimately to encompass all the lands from the Hindu Kush to North Africa. Emphasizing the growth of ancient Iranian culture--particularly art, architecture, literature, and their influence--we investigate the traditional myths and religions of ancient Iran, the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness, the establishment of Shi'i Islam as the state religion, and the conflict of the vision and mysticism of traditional Iranian culture with that of the West. We survey the political organization of the Empire, Alexander the Great's conquest of Iran and its aftermath, and the impact of the Arab-Islamic conquest. We examine the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness after World War II, and the transformation of the country during the Islamic Revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic StudiesSPRING 2011 V55.0549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History) syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond.\n\nExpressive Culture\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses0751 Expressive Culture: Television Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus The Twilight Zone and Expressive Culture of the 1950s and 1960s. According to clich\u00e9, the 1950s in America were a period of conformity and consensus, but it is clear that there were many signs of discontent with and within the image of cheerful homogeneity. For example, at the end of the decade, the television program The Twilight Zone, showed everyday life as a source of paranoia in which ordinary existence revealed its frightening underside. Then, as the nation engaged with the New Frontier of the Kennedy 1960s, the show used science fiction to represent dreams as American nightmares. We look at The Twilight Zone in terms of its expressive rendition of 1950s and 1960s America. Along the way, we examine the shift in American television from East Coast production of liberal drama to West Coast production of escapism and entertainment and will situate Rod Serling's career within that shift. We also examine other renditions of paranoia (and symbolic resolutions of it) across the popular culture and politics of the moment. Most broadly, we attempt to examine the medium of popular television as an expressive cultural form which enlightened liberals like Serling tried to use as a mode of moral and aesthetic uplift. Critical methods that might help us understand the potentials of television as expressive culture are emphasized.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. Zayaruzny investigateSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. MuellerSPRING 2011 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75, considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in American society. Examines developments in film genre during this period especially in relation to political and cultural change. Narrative innovations are emphasized, with special attention to the specificity of film form and style (e.g., editing, mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, sound). Provides an introduction to the methods and principles of film analysis as well as dealing with this period of filmmaking in depth. Includes films by Kubrick, Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese.\n\nStudy Abroad at NYU Global Sites\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain\nProf. Woods (NYU in London) syllabus The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa\nProf. Adams (NYU in Ghana) syllabus African culture through autobiography. Texts consist of chronological life histories and memoirs, e. g., by writers of aristocratic birth and those of peasant birth, by individuals accomplished in the arts and others in the sciences, by Nobel laureates and by political leaders, by women and by men. Each narrative provides an intimate acquaintance with the traditions, aspirations, challenges, and strategies from the writer's own society. Collectively they provide the skeleton of a usefully subjective narrative of modern African history. The depicted lives include an 18th-century enslaved Nigerian child, who, ultimately, as a free man, would become a respected abolitionist; the U.S.-educated leader of Africa's first nation to gain independence from colonialism; the passionate Kenyan crusader for the preservation of Africa's environment as the source of its self-development; and the physically and morally courageous exemplar of the battle that overthrew South African apartheid.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America\nProf. Galban (NYU in Madrid) syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain's New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multicultural France\nProf. Epstein (NYU in Paris) syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \"race,\" identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \"ethnic community\" so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \"homogeneity\" of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \"primitive\" art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague\u2014In the Heart of Central Europe\nProf. Mucha (NYU in Prague) syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world's richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel\nProf. Emmerich (NYU in Tel Aviv) syllabus Explores various aspects of the production of everydayness in Israel as it is manifested in different sites: the arts, the leisure industry, and the spatio-temporal arrangements of daily routines and practices. Given its unique geo-political circumstances and its symbolic position, Israel attracts much media coverage as well as more scholarly treatment of the Israeli-Arab or Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More often than not, Israel is portrayed through the lens of high politics or treated as an exotic anomaly. Whether popular or academic in its orientation, the study of Israeli society has thus tended to neglect everyday life in Israel.

It will not affect your coursework mark.\n(The coursework marks have been finalised and are available via the Grade\nCentre in Blackboard.)\n\nModule description and prerequisites\n\nYou should have general facility for dealing with algebraic structures: complex numbers, sets, groups, rings, fields. For this reason, MATH20212 Algebraic Structures 2 is a prerequisite.\n\nAbout the course\n\nMany find MATH32012 Commutative Algebra the most advanced abstract algebra course they take as part of their degree.\nNevertheless, the content of the course is not just a sequence of theorems and proofs.\nYou are expected to learn methods of algebraic computation relating to polynomials in several variables.\n\nSolving equations has been a driving force of algebra at least since the Babylonians learned to solve quadratic equations some 3700 years ago. The subject matter of this course is, however, informed by more recent developments.\n\nThe work of Hilbert in late 19th - 20th century was key to the modern treatment of multivariate polynomials and provided a basis for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. His result that every (consistent) system of polynomial equations over an algebraically closed field has at least one solution is known as the Nullstellensatz.\nBut an efficient method of finding such solutions by elimination was not found until 1965, when Buchberger invented Gr\u00f6bner bases.\n\nIn the course, key theorems about the ring of polynomials in several variables will be rigorously proved.\nAlgorithms relating to polynomials will be explained and supported by examples. This includes factorising polynomials into irreducible factors and computing a Gr\u00f6bner basis of an ideal.\n\nResults and methods of Commutative Algebra have applications in various branches of mathematics and computer science. Here are some puzzles which we may use in the course as an illustration for the main content. You are welcome to have a go at solving them!\n\nQuestion 1 (Fermat, 17th century).\nFind all integers a \"sandwiched\" between a square and a cube.\n\nQuestion 2.\nHow many ways are there of placing 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other? What about n queens on an n\u00d7n chessboard?\n\nQuestion 3.\nHow many distinct Sudoku boards are there? (A Sudoku board is a 9\u00d79 square\nwith a number from 1 to 9 in each cell, satisfying the Sudoku constraints.)\n\nimages from Wikimedia commons\n\nCoursework\n\nThere will be 2 pieces of assessed coursework:\n\nAssessed homework 1 (see a link above): a take-home problem sheet\nset on Wednesday 27 February (week 5),\ndue on Tuesday 12 March (week 7) at 4pm.\n\nBlackboard-based online test: a timed, open-book test which the students complete online; multiple attempts are allowed\n\nPrevious years' exams\n\nCommutative algebra exam papers from years 2008-2012 are available here."}

Each unit is framed by enduring understandings and essential questions designed to allow students a deep understanding of the concepts at hand rather than memorization and emulation. Students will also complete several performance tasks throughout the year consisting of relevant, open-ended tasks requiring students to connect multiple statistical topics together. The TI-83+/84 OR 89 calculator and computers will be used to explore the world of data and the patterns which can be found by analyzing this information as well as statistical relationships.\n\nStandards Alignments\n\nAll SVL curriculum is aligned to Spokane Public School district curriculum, which is explicitly designed to support rigorous curriculum in order to stretch each learner to achieve at their highest ability through our district\ufffds Written, Taught and Tested Initiative.

Check out my groups if you are at all interested or curious.\n\nBelow are the web addresses for my groups (CAREFUL, I had to put a space after each slash, so if you copy and paste, delete the spaces):\n\nYou could try searching for one first. For example, you could probably find one or more in 83plus/basic/math (such as baseic.zip or bases.zip) or in 83/basic/math.\n\nI don't want to sound rude or condescending, but you really should look first for what you want before you ask someone to do something for you. This site especially has most math programs a beginner like you or I would need.\n\nOnce you've learned enough and need a program that doesn't exist (at least on ticalc), one should hope that you would have the ability and knowledge to write what you need by yourself or at least to search the many resources available to you on the Internet and other places. This goes for most every beginner, not just you.\n\nI'm not trying to be high and mighty by calling you and others a beginner; I still consider myself to be a beginner in many ways.\n\nhi i am taking AP Calculus. please, i am begging you. someone has to create a super program for this class. it isn't a hard class, but it takes time to solve some stuff. also, a calculus program would save me time in contests. well see you and thanks\n\nA lot of programs calculate everything for you in the background, giving you a final answer.

{"text": "The content. Analysis is about the concepts of function, derivative, and integral (quoted from the preface for the Shilov's book). As a starting point in this study we will look into the structure of real line and explore some of the axioms of the real number system.\n\nThe primary focus in the initial part of the course will be on the Completeness Axiom and various equivalent forms of it. We will study in detail the concepts of limit, derivative, integral, and the series. Although you have already study all those concepts in your Calculus courses, I am sure that you will realize that there is a lot of room to improve our basic understanding of those concepts. Real Analysis is one of the key courses in the foundations of mathematics, and most of the time in this course will be spent into looking back into the foundations of Calculus. However, we would also like to use our improved understanding of\n\nCalculus to move toward the greater level of abstractions, and to learn something about some of the more \"modern\" developments of Analysis. In particular, we will study the concept of Metric Spaces a little bit.\n\n1. Program Assessment - Course Objectives Here is a concise list of course goals following the format of Math Department\n\nAssessment Plan. In Section\n\n1\n\n2 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005\n\nCourse-level Outcomes. Students shall study foundations of the real number system, limits, continuity, derivative and integral.\n\nMathematical Reasoning: Students will try to achieve an in-depth understanding of the ideas presented. This includes making sure statements and claims made are checked for accuracy, and an appropriate justification is given.\n\nProblem Solving: A number of calculus problems will be revisited, and many new solved. This course will challenge and develop students' problems solving skills to the limit.\n\nCommunication: The main mode of communication in this course will be written (homework, exams). However, in-class participation (oral communication) is essential, as well.\n\nTechnology: Use of a Computer Algebra System (Derive, Maxima) and\n\nLATEX.\n\n2. Course Philosophy and Procedure\n\nIn order to succeed in this course, you should really immerse yourself totally in doing mathematics. The key strategy in solving problems is \"not to give up\". This course is truly a problem solving course.\n\nMost of the course time will be spent on limits, derivatives, integrals,.... You will see again some of the stuff that you are familiar with, but sooner or later you will stumble over some basic stuff that you actually do not know very well.\n\nYou should certainly build up on your strengths (the stuff you more or less know), but make sure that you do not neglect working on the weaknesses, as well. Use homework and exams as directions, but you should really guide yourself in the work of filling in the gaps in your knowledge in order to be able to meet the goals set up by the homework and exam problems.\n\nMathematics is not a spectator sport. It is learned by doing. Viterbo University is striving to be a Learner-centered institution. That entails an expectation of maturity and taking responsibility for their learning on the part of students. I see my job as one helping you succeed in this learning process.\n\nIn spite of my best efforts, I may not always manage to say things the way which best leads to your full comprehension. You can also help me by providing as much of a feedback as you can. I will try to do a formal evaluation survey around the middle of the semester. Other than that, I find the questions in class, and especially when someone comes to my office for assistance, very helpful.\n\nAs a further assistance to you:\n\n\u2022 About a week prior to any exam, you will receive a practice exam which will be, in terms of format and type of problems, very much like the actual exam.\n\n\u2022 I am asking you to keep a The Learner's Journal. This is to be a separate notebook that should contain a record of your study/practice on daily basis.\n\nI would also like you to keep a time log - date, hour from-to - for each study session. I would prefer that you use a pen for writing in that journal. If you are going to use pencil, then please do not use erasers, and in any case, do not tear pages out. For a learning to take place, you have to try to do\n\nMATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005 3 something. In trying, you are likely to make mistakes. The real learning will start taking place once you start understanding and correcting your mistakes.\n\nYou turn that journal in together with your exam, and then you will be graded for the portion of that journal that covers the period preceding that current exam. Up to 30% of the exam score is possible to earn this way.\n\nThe elements that will play the key role in grading the journal are\n\n\u2013 Organization - readability: In order to evaluate, I have to able to read it first. I should not have a difficult time navigating through those notes.\n\n\u2013 Mathematical correctness.\n\n\u2013 The quality of the work and the amount of time spent on studying.\n\n\u2022 Take-home problems: These assignments should test/help a better integration of material. Some will include more difficult problems. One of those assignments will be a group HW. In general, I encourage you to find some time to study together, but unless stated otherwise, the HW is to be written up on your own.\n\nI will try to space those assignments so that you could have some time to catch up. This should leave significant room for exploring the book on your own, and I encourage you to find your own balance between solving some problems in full, and just sketching solutions to some. You should try to read, meaning to the point where you really understand the question, most of the book problems.\n\nThe work in class, your book, HW, and practice exams should give you a pretty clear idea what is that you are expected to learn. It is your job to, perhaps through trial and error, find learning strategies that work best for you. Remember, learning is something you do, rather than something I do to you.\n\nHelp. I am used to you asking questions in class, coming to my office, working in groups, asking questions by e-mail. Hope all of that will continue.\n\nThere is a growing mount of Internet resources, too. Just go to Yahoo, or Google and search for \"real analysis\". In particular, you may want to look at\n\nSome of the HW will involve some use of technology (CAS and LATEX). The details will be given later.\n\nOne of the writing assignments will be graded in two parts - the second part will require you to come to my office and explain your reasoning, answer some questions.\n\nIn all your work, written and oral, it is essential to provide explanations, justify your reasoning.\n\nMy grading scale is\n\nA=80%, B=60%, C=40%, D > 30%.\n\nThe following exceptions to that scale are possible:\n\n\u2022 An A on the final exam (more than 180/200 points) will mean an A for the final grade as well.\n\n4 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005\n\n\u2022 If one is passing the course by the time of the final exam, but earns less than 30% points (a score less than 60/200), that will result in an F for the final grade.\n\n3. Some details and examples\n\nSpecific Course Goals. To study rigorous foundations of calculus; extend basic knowledge of functions, limits, derivatives and integrals. Students are expected to learn to state definitions and theorems precisely, and be able to prove theorems stated. In particular, the proofs involving the concept of limit are going to be of central importance.\n\nThe process of working toward those goals will involve looking back into everything you have learned in mathematics so far, and to subject those concepts to the following key questions:\n\n\u2022 What do I really know about...?\n\n\u2022 What does...mean?\n\n\u2022 Is what I just said about...true?\n\n\u2022 How do I know if (why) it is true?\n\nLet me try to clarify this a little bit by looking into an example.\n\nExample: For some Math 155 students, conquering a problem such as\n\np8 + p32 \u2212\n\np18 = 3p2\n\nrepresents a major undertaking; something they consider worth of including into their portfolio for the semester.\n\nNow, when you look at what is involved into justifying the above result, a number of problems present themselves. For example, we have to use the rule\n\npAB = pApB, A,B 0.\n\nCan you prove that rule?\n\nAnother key rule here is\n\nAC + BC = (A + B)C.\n\nHow about proving this one It is much more difficult question than one before.\n\nIn fact, it is so basic that there is nothing more basic to use as a help in proving it. So, we have to accept that rule as an axiom. Note: I would like to encourage you to read [4, Chapter 4] here!\n\nMoreover, the rules are used by applying them to \"existing\" mathematical objects (in this case, real numbers). But, what do we mean by p2. Can you prove that such a number exists? What do we even mean by asking a question like that?\n\nThe goal of this course is not only to learn how to answer the questions as those (that is how to do certain rigorous proofs), but we would also like to develop the corresponding mathematical awareness, so that we do not overlook those \"simple\" questions when solving problems.\n\nUltimately, this kind of training leads to deepening our understanding of what mathematics is about. We would like to use that improved understanding to bring about other two basic goals of this course, which are:\n\n\u2022 Move beyond the concepts we are familiar with. We will study the concept of metric spaces.\n\nFall 1999 - Final. To illustrate the goal of \"improving Calculus skills\", let's consider the final exam I gave to the Real Analysis class in Fall 1999.\n\nProblem 1. \u2022 State the definitions of a lower/upper bound of a set of real numbers.\n\n\u2022 State the definition of infimum.\n\n\u2022 State the theorem about existence of an infimum of a set bounded below.\n\n\u2022 Extra credit: Should I say \"the infimum\"?\n\n\u2022 Prove that the set\n\nS = 3,\n\n5\n\n2,\n\n7\n\n3,\n\n9\n\n4,... has an infimum, and find that infimum.\n\n\u2022 State the Completeness Axiom.\n\n\u2022 Prove that the Completeness Axiom is equivalent to the Infimum Theorem\n\nabove.\n\nProblem 2. Define\n\nf(x) =\n\n1Xn=1\n\nn2 + 1\n\nn! xn.\n\n(a) Use the ratio test to show that f is defined for all real x.\n\n(b) Prove that f is continuous at x = 0.\n\nProblem 3. State the definition of the derivative f0(a) of a function f at the point a of its domain.\n\nUse that definition to find the derivative of f(x) = 3x at an arbitrary point of\n\nDf.\n\nProblem 4. Find,\n\nlim\n\nx!0\n\nsin (ln (1 + x))\n\nln (1 + sin (x)).\n\nState and prove all the rules used in the process. In the case of L'Hospital's rule, just state it. The proof would be an extra credit.\n\nProblem 5. Probably most of the functions we have encountered so far would be continuously differentiable. That is, if f is differentiable at x = a, then f0 is a continuous function at\n\nx = a.\n\nIs this statement a theorem?\n\nHint: Show that the function\n\nf(x) = (x2 sin \udbc0\udc001\n\nx, if x 6= 0\n\n0, if x = 0\n\nis a counterexample.\n\n6 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005\n\nA student that has passed a Calculus sequence should have no difficulty in understanding almost all of the questions on that final. Being able to answer them completely is a different matter.\n\nAmericans with Disability Act. If"}

{"text": "Intermediate Algebra, 1e, authored by Sherri Messersmith presents content in bite-size pieces, focusing not only on learning mathematical concepts, but also explaining the why behind those concepts. For students, learning mathematics is not just about the memorization of concepts and formulas, but it is also about the journey of learning how to problem solve. By breaking the sections down into manageable chunks, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle, and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward. Proven pedagogical features, such as You Try problems after each example, reinforce a student's mastery of a concept. While teaching in the classroom, Messersmith has created worksheets for each section that fall into three categories: review worksheets/basic skills, worksheets to teach new content, and worksheets to reinforce/pull together different concepts. These worksheets are a great way to both enhance instruction and to give the students more tools to be successful in studying a given topic. The author is also an extremely popular lecturer, and finds it important to be in the video series that accompany her texts. Finally, the author finds it important to not only provide quality, but also an abundant quantity of exercises and applications.

{"text": "Edie M. Brown / Academic Therapist\n\nPeople often say that mathematics is a universal language. It is the essence of cognition - thinking with numbers, imagery, and language. For the people who understand mathematics, the language of numbers turns into imagery, letting them calculate and verify mathematics while seeing its logic. Through multisensory instruction, I integrate all of the senses to help create a mathematical picture of concepts and theories, forming the foundation of understanding.\n\nMathematics\n\nMath literacy means having the mechanics and skills to perform calculations without looking them up and knowing what situations these skills may be appropriate. The true \"math literate\" is not someone who can successfully complete a test on recently acquired processes and techniques, but one who can apply those abilities to situations that occur in a variety of situations in the long term.\n\nIn secondary and postsecondary math, there should be a broad focus encompassing a wide variety of career choices. This includes common foundations of math ideas and applications. Students should be adept at the integration of mathematical concepts. These areas include algebra, geometry, probability, statistics, calculus, and discrete mathematics."}

{"text": "You are here\n\nTips to help make Math Simple\n\nFrustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word \"Math\"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.\n\nRead the Book\n\nRead the assigned sections over carefully and look closely at the sample problems. Decide if you benefit more by reading before or after the instructor covers the material.\n\nDevelop a Sound Math Foundation\n\nBecause most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nTime Management\n\nComplete all readings \u2013 especially homework assignments \u2013 as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nCalculator\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.\n\nShow Your Work\n\nAvoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.\n\nOrganise Your Work and\n\nWrite Legibly\n\nWrite all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.\n\nSpaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.\n\nBe sure to line up the terms in each step of the solution, and write steps one below the other rather than to the right or left. Use lined paper or graph paper to help organise the problems on your page. Don't scrunch! Use plenty of paper to work each problem. Recycle the paper at the end of the term if you are concerned about wasting paper.\n\nSupport Services and Materials\n\nFind out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!\n\nPreparation and Supplies\n\n\u2022 Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:\n\n\u2022 Complete any previously assigned homework assignments\n\n\u2022 Compile a list of questions about the previous assignments to ask the instructor"}

{"text": "Book Description\n\nRelease date: August 5, 2008 | Age Range: 11 and upEditorial Reviews\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBest known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar is also an internationally recognized mathematician. She was chosen as ABC World News Tonight's \"Person of the Week\" for writing Math Doesn't Suck and has recently been featured in Newsweek and The New York Times, and on the CBS Early Show, and NPR's Science Friday.\n--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this titleThis funny math book teaches girls that it's OK to be smart, and that they are perfectly capable of kicking a little pre-algebra butt.\n\nMcKellar takes a lightweight approach to math, but is deadly serious about it. In the prologue, she writes that \"lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college.\" Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.\n\nAnd it's not just fear. Girls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school. Testimonials in Kiss My Math fight this. Stephanie Perry, the finance director for Essence magazine, explains how she uses algebraic formulas to stay on top of the magazine's financial performance. Jane Davis, financial strategist at Polo Ralph Lauren, was hired as an assistant buyer because of her facility with math. She describes determining inventory over time by finding the mean of a list of numbers.\n\nMcKellar -- famous for playing Winnie Cooper in the \"The Wonder Years\" but also a summa cum laude math graduate from UCLA -- uses simple language and lots of illustrations to teach pre-algebra. Each chapter covers a single topic, such as the distributive property or exponents. She clearly explains each topic, and includes problems for the reader to solve (answers are in the back). The author is generous with helpful notes and shortcuts.\n\nA lively, breezy writing style makes it seem as if McKellar is sitting next to the reader. She uses examples girls can relate to, like clothes shopping, working on the school play, blind dates, parties, kissing and breath mints. It's like having the perfect math tutor. (I'm not a middle school girl, of course, but I just got finished having one. My daughter is starting high school this month.)\n\nEspecially good are the entries called Danica's Diary, which are true stories from the author's life as a student, actress and mathematician. One is titled: Dumbing Ourselves Down for Guys: Why is it so Tempting? McKellar gives practical advice on how girls can avoid this common pitfall.\n\nI can't think of a better book to buy for a girl taking pre-algebra.\n\nHere's the chapter list:\n\nPart 1: Number Stuff Chapter 1: Breath Mint, Anyone? Adding and Subtracting Integers (Including Negative Numbers). Chapter 2: The Popular Crowd. The Associative and Commutative Properties. Chapter 3: Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall...

Intro to Variables with Exponents. You Said: Well... That Didn't Work! Do You Sudoku?\n\nI am a mother that went back to college later in life. One of my classes was algebra. I had math anxiety and tried to find way to wiggle my way out of this class. The algebra class was very difficult for me. I could not understand the instructor or the book. I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both). So I had a six week break before I had to take the algebra class again. I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!\n\nDanica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school."}
{"text": "MATH\n320 Number Systems, Statistics and Probability (5) Continuation of the\ndevelopment of the real numbers including applications and models of rational\nnumbers, irrational numbers, percent, and proportional reasoning. Introduction\nto the basic notions of chance and probability. Introduction to data analysis\nand statistics. This course involves substantial use of 2- and 3-dimensional\nconcrete materials in a cooperative learning setting. Prerequisites: A grade of\nC- or better in MATH 221. (4\nunits lecture and 1 unit activity).\n\nObjectives:\nMathematics 320 is the second of a sequence of three courses designed to help\nstudents gain the mathematical knowledge, skills, and understanding that are\nessential for those pursuing a Multiple Subject Credential as prescribed by the\nCalifornia Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Students will identify and\nprioritize relevant and missing information in mathematical problems. They will\nanalyze complex problems to identify similar simple problems that might suggest\nsolution strategies. They will explain their mathematical reasoning through a\nvariety of methods, such as words, numbers, symbols, charts, graphs, tables,\ndiagrams, and concrete models. They will use appropriate mathematical notation\nwith clear and accurate language. They will explain how to derive a result based\non previously developed ideas and explain how a result is related to other\nideas.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nfunctions with domain the rational numbers.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\ndecimals and operations on decimals.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nnonterminating decimals.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nreal numbers.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nratios, proportions and proportional reasoning.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\npercents.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nprobabilities.\n\nPerform experiments with tree\ndiagrams and geometric probabilities.\n\nUsing simulations in\nprobability.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nodds, conditional probability and expected value.\n\nDraw sensible conclusions from\ndisplayed data.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nmeasures of central tendency and variation.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding\nwhen statistics is abused.\n\nNote:\nAlthough some attention will be given to how to teach mathematics effectively to\nchildren, this is a content course, not a methods course. Methodology is the\nprimary focus of the Credential Program.\n\nClass Meetings: MW: 10:50-12:30 pm,\nScience III 103.\n\nTh:\n10:30-12:30 pm, Science III 103.\n\nTextbook\n(required): Custom\nedition of A Problem Solving Approach to Mathematics for Elementary Teachers,\n10th ed, Part 1, by Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott, and a packet of labs\ntaken from Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers An Activity Approach,\nby Bennett, Burton, and Nelson. Sections of the text being covered in\nlecture should be read prior to coming to class. Lectures will not cover all\ntopics from each section, but students will be responsible for all topics in the\nsection.\n\nSupplies:\nIn addition to the textbook, each student must have a scientific calculator,\nseveral colored pencils, and 1/4-inch graph paper. These should be brought to\nclass with you each day.\n\nHomework:\nMathematics is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Although homework\nassignments will not be collected, it is assumed that you will do the homework\nnecessary for success in this class. We will spend considerable time at the\nbeginning of each lecture working out homework problems. Answers to most of the\nassigned problems are in the back of the book. If you are not able to solve a\nparticular problem, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates will be\ngrateful.\n\nReadings:\nThe student is responsible for reading at least twice each section of the book\ncovered in class: Before and after the lecture. The student will be told in\nadvance what sections of the book are to read. If you are not able to\nunderstand something in the book, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates\nwill be grateful.\n\nQuizzes:\nThere will be seven\nquizzes, each of them administered most Thursdays at 10:35 pm; the student will\nbe able to drop the lowest score. Quizzes may not be made-up. If you miss a\nquiz you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any quizearly with the instructor's permission. Problems will be similar to those in\nthe homework or in the preceding activity. The primary purpose of these quizzesis to provide you with frequent evaluation of your content acquisition and\nto help you to reduce math anxiety. Quiz work is individual, see Note 2\nbelow.\n\nActivities:\nSeven activity\nassignments will be collected; the student will be able to drop the lowest\nscore. Activity attendance is required: Most Thursdays 10:50-12:30.\nThe student should work in groups of at least 3 people and 4 at most. During\nactivity sessions the student will work on an activity sheet and each member\nof his/her group should hand in a report at the beginning of next Thursday at\nthe latest. Activity work must be turned in on the activity pages from the\npacket. Late reports and reports from students absent from even one meeting\nwill not be accepted. A report should be neat and readable; solutions should\nfollow an increasing numerical sequence. Each member of a group will receive the\nsame number of points, so it is your responsibility to write down in each report\nonly the names of those who substantially contributed to the activity.\n\nExams:\nThere will be two Midterm exams and a cumulative final. Questions and problems\nwill deal with concepts discussed in lectures, homework, textbook, and\nactivities. Exchange of information, calculators, and supplies is absolutely\nprohibited during exams! To clarify a particular situation, the instructor\nreserves the right to a further examination, written or oral. Exam work is\nindividual, see Note 2 below. Midterm exams may not be made-up. If you miss\nan exam you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any exam\nearly with the instructor's permission.\n\nPartial\nCredit: Only substantial\ncontributions to the solution of a problem will count for partial credit. Mere\nrestating of a problem or the quoting of an incorrect fact, for example, will\nnot make you eligible for it. Students must watch out for logical mistakes, and\nmust make sure that all the hypotheses are met before recalling a particular\ntheorem.\n\nGrades:\nYour final grade is a function of the total of points awarded on the activities\nindicated above. Group homework is very helpful and greatly promoted in this\ncourse. However, it is necessary for college graduates to demonstrate individual\ncompetency on the subject. Therefore, regardless of your total of points, in\norder to get a D- or better in this course all of the following should be\nfulfilled at least:\n\n(a) To have scored at least\n200 points in the 2 Midterm exams combined.\n\n(b) To have scored at least\n105 points in the final exam.\n\nGenerally, the following guidelines\nfor grades apply:\n\n960 -1000 A\n900 - 959 A-\n\n870 - 899\nB+ 840 - 869 B 800 - 839 B-\n\n770 - 799\nC+ 740 - 769 C 700 - 739 C-\n\n670 - 699\nD+ 640 - 669 D 600 - 639 D-\n\n0- 599 F\n\nIf\nyou entered the liberal studies program on Fall 2011, you are required to get a\nC or better in all classes that you are taking for your major - this includes\nMath 320.\n\nNotes:\n\n1)\nIt is the student's responsibility\nto find out what (s)he missed if (s)he did not attend class. Office hours are\nnot meant for tutorial courses, but rather to clarify particular situations or\nproblems occurring during lectures, homework, labs, assignments or readings.\nStudents are encouraged to make use of the Office Hours.\n\n3)\nThe instructor will hold graded\npapers for one week at most. After this period, he will trash old papers.\nContact him as soon as you foresee a problem picking up your paper(s).\n\n4)\nAll handouts (with solutions) will\nbe in the internet (follow the link Math 320 in \n\n5)\nBeepers, cell phones, i-pods,\nlaptops and similar electronic devices must be turned off at all times during\nclass or lab time. If not, the student will have to leave the room without being\nallowed to return.\n\n6)\nStudents can be at most 10 minutes\nlate. Students cannot leave the room, unless it is for medical reasons."}

{"text": "The book I used in my 'proofs' class was \"Doing Mathematics: An Introduction to Proofs and Problem Solving\" by Steven Galovich, here on Amazon.\n\nThe class was called \"Mathematical Structures\", which is an apt name since the class wasn't solely about learning to prove things. It was learning to prove things in the context of learning about basic mathematical objects. It starts with basic logic, but after it introduces sets, relations, functions, equivlance relations and the like, it goes onto to develop the ideas of cardinality, including Cantor-Bernstein. It also has a couple other topics, like some basic combinatorics, the constructions of number systems, or looking at consequences of the field axioms.\n\nIt was a great introduction to what math is \"really about\" coming after some mostly computational calculus and linear algebra courses.

It includes mathematical issues, but also questions from the philosophy of mathematics, the psychology of mathematical discovery, the history of mathematics, and biographies of mathematicians, in short, a book about the mathematical experience broadly considered\u2026 The book found its way into \"Much for liberal arts students\" courses and into education courses directed at future teachers. Term paper topics, essay assignments, problems, computer applications, and suggested readings are included. This new material should greatly enhance the usefulness of this very creative book. The range of topics covered is immense and the contents cannot easily be summarized. The book makes excellent casual reading, would make a good textbook, or could easily be used as a supplement to nearly any course concerned with mathematics.\" -Zentralblatt Math \"This is a people-centered book about mathematics, and as such it provides an opportunity to explore fundamental issues that are typically absent from the experience of most college and university students (as well as their teachers). This new edition provides an excellent initiation of students into some of the more challenging aspects of mathematics\u2026The study edition of The Mathematical Experience will help its readers acquire a real understanding of mathematics.\" -Notices of the AMS \"Two distinguished mathematicians...have written a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor...\" --The New Yorker (1984 American Book Award Edition)\n\nBack in the early 90's when I was an almost-penniless mathematics student I was standing in front of a bookshelf in my local bookstore and had to choose between this and G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach. I chose this book and I still don't regret it. [I have also subsequently bought GEB :-)] Driven by their obvious love of the subject, the authors do a credible job of tackling just what it is about mathematics that makes mathematicians love it so much, often to the bafflement of the rest of the world. A particular personal favourite is the series of four conversations between an \"ideal mathematician\" and, respectively, a University Public Information Officer, a philosophy student, a positive philosopher and a sceptical classicist. I would recommend this book to students of mathematics at any level beyond the elementary, especially those with an interest in the foundations of their subject. The authors do however acknowledge that some parts of the book will seem alien to the layman.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who enjoys Horizon and other science programs but wishes they were less stripped of technicalities and more in depth: if you are very curious about physics and mathematics, you may find this a very stimulating read. After all you don't need to be a good comedian to enjoy watching comedy, so with little mathematical knowledge you can enjoy this very wide ranging discussion of many exotic fields of maths and gain a sense of the range and significance and methodologies of this field at the outer limits of human abstract thought. This very readable, demanding, though provoking book that can occupy you for weeks and sustain several re-readings.\n\nAround my early to mid teens, finding the mathematics I was being taught easy but also puzzling I started to have philosophical questions that were just not properly addressed. I later hoped (naively I now know) my Science/Engineering degree would answer those questions. It didn't. I had wanted to dig deeper into what mathematics is but instead was taught increasingly obscure and complex \"results\" that were useful to my discipline. Had I known it at the time this book would have answered my questions (often answering them with more questions, true). It appears to give an excellent framework to the consideration of any uneasiness you might feel with mathematics especially if you find/found school levels maths easy.\n\nIf after reading this you still feel uneasy then you know you need to proceed further into philosophy."}

{"text": "3: Communicate the breadth and interconnections of the\nmathematical sciences\n\nEvery course should strive to:\n\nPresent\nkey ideas and concepts from a variety of perspectives;\n\nEmploy\na broad range of examples and applications to illustrate and motivate\nthe material;\n\nPromote\nawareness of connections to other subjects (both in and out of the\nmathematical sciences), and strengthen each student ability to apply the\ncourse material to these subjects;\n\nIntroduce\ncontemporary topics from the mathematical sciences and their\napplications, and enhance student perceptions of the vitality and\nimportance of mathematics in the modern world.\n\nKey\nIdeas and Concepts from Varied Perspectives\n\nProject Intermath\nis an interdisciplinary mathematics project that is creating curricula at the\nUnited StatesMilitaryAcademy, CarrollCollegeGeorgiaCollege & StateUniversity, HarveyMuddCollege, MacalesterCollege,\nUniversity of Redlands, and the Texas Southern\nConsortium. By working with professors from science, engineering, mathematics\nand computer science departments, the project aims to foster the creation of\ninterdisciplinary courses that demonstrate the interdependence of mathematics\nand science. For example, at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy, first semester students study the concept of change\nfrom both a discrete and a continuous point of view. At the end of the\nsemester students must model and solve particular problems by using a\ndiscrete dynamical system and by using a differential equation. Students then\ncompare and discuss the appropriateness and the results of the two\napproaches. Within the four-course core program, students at the United\nStates Military Academy also examine mathematical topics from the\nperspectives of linear versus nonlinear and stochastic versus deterministic.\nAt Carroll College, a 4-class core consisting of a total of 18 credit hours\ncovers many of the topics seen in the first two years of a traditional\ncurriculum, including differential and integral calculus, multivariable\ncalculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The core also includes\ntopics not usually seen early, if at all: discrete dynamical systems, partial\ndifferential equations, probability, and statistics. Concepts\nare threaded together in and between classes to help students develop a\ndeeper understanding of how different branches of mathematics are\nintertwined. The website contains complete texts for over 40 modeling\nproblems developed at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy site.\n\nAlthough a number of the textbooks produced during the calculus reform\nmovement are no longer in print, both mainstream and reform texts now\nconsider the concepts of calculus from a variety of perspectives: not only\nthe symbolic, but also the graphical, numerical, and verbal. The\nCalculus Consortium at Harvard Newslettersdiscuss issues involved in teaching calculus. Many\ncalculus texts now come with software to enhance student understanding from a\nvariety of perspectives.\n\nA good source of ideas on how to teach linear algebra from various\nperspectives is Resources\nfor Teaching Linear Algebra, edited by David Carlson, Charles R.\nJohnson, David Lay, Duane Porter, Ann Watkins, and William Watkins, MAA\nNotes vol. 42.\n\nThe concept of function can be regarded from many different perspectives\nand is important in all undergraduate mathematics courses. The editors of The\nConcept of Function: Aspects of Epistemology and Pedagogy (Harel & Dubinsky, 1992) contributed to the body of\nresearch on learning the function concept in order to assist in instructional\napproaches. Key\nAspects of Knowing and Learning the Concept of Function by Marilyn\nCarlson and Michael Oehrtman is a recent online\narticle that provides a broad view of the subject.\n\nVictor Donnay, BrynMawrCollege, developed a\nPowerPoint presentation\ndescribing how computer visualization can be used to give an intuitive\nunderstanding of complex ideas in modern mathematics.\n\nPromote\nAwareness of Connections between Mathematics and Other Subjects\n\nApplications\n\nDan Maki (Indiana University Bloomington) and Bart Ng\n(Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis) co-direct the NSF-funded\nproject Mathematics\nThroughout the Curriculum. The website includes links to a prototype\ncourse Analytical\nProblem Solving and a set of Home Pages for\nDeveloping Courses, which contain additional information about courses\nthat relate mathematics to the life sciences, business and economics, the\nhumanities and social sciences, and the physical sciences and engineering. A newsletter\nprovides additional information about the project.\n\nThe MAA'sJournal\nof Online Mathematics and its Applications (JOMA) contains\npeer-reviewed articles, class-tested, web-based learning materials, and\nself-contained, dynamic, single-purpose learning tools. Many of these\nillustrate a range of examples and applications and connections between\nmathematics and other subjects. Some recent articles are Special\nRelativity and Conic Sections, Designing Attribute Acceptance Sampling Plans,\nand Art and Design in Mathematics.\n\nDukeUniversity's\nConnected Curriculum Project\ncollects and develops interactive learning materials for mathematics and its\napplications, with applications to biology, chemistry, economics,\nengineering, environmental sciences, epidemiology, and physics. Each\napplication is keyed to the level of mathematics used.\n\nThe MAA'sDigital Classroom Resources\nprovides a select collection of learning materials that are available without\ncharge through the site. These materials have been classroom tested and peer\nreviewed. Many items in the library include editorial reviews and links to a\nmoderated discussion group focused on the materials.\n\nThe entry for the Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP)\nin the bibliography contains additional information about incorporating\nreal-world applications into mathematics courses.\n\nHistory\n\nThe MAA's online journal Convergence\nis a new online magazine that provides resources to help teach mathematics\nusing its history. ReinhardLaubenbacher,\nDavid Pengelley, Jerry Lodder,\nand others at New MexicoStateUniversity\nhave developed a large collection\nof instructional materials to teach mathematics using original historical\nsources. Other books that link mathematical topics with their history\ninclude William Dunham's Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of\nMathematics and The Calculus Gallery, Simon Singh's Fermat's\nEnigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem\nand The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum\nCryptography, Rudy Rucker'sInfinity\nand the Mind: The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite, and Marcia Ascher'sEthnomathematics.\nA Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas. Judith Grabiner\nof PitzerCollege developed two\ngeneral education courses with an emphasis on history: Mathematics,\nPhilosophy, and the 'Real World,' and Mathematics\nin Many Cultures.\n\nArt\n\nIn a note to Project NExT participants, Doris Schattschneider,\nMoravian College, gave the following list of websites for courses linking\nmathematics, art, and design:\n* Survey course on mathematics in art\nand architecture by Paul Calter at Dartmouth\nCollege\n* Course on Mathematics\nin Art by HelmerAskalan\n* Course in Mathematics\nand Art by Marc Franz\n* Jill Britton's website on Symmetry and\nTessellations, with annotated links to many other sites on these and related\ntopics\n* Totally\nTessellated (can be accessed from Britton's site)\n* A mini-site\non Escher's work and related math\n* An exhibit\nby artists whose work has been influenced by M.C. Escher featured at the\nEscher Centennial Congress in Rome in 1998\n* A website about harmony and\nproportion by John Boyd-Brent, M.A, Royal College of Art\n* This website,\nrelated to a 'technical' paper by D. Schattschneider\nand N. Dolbilin, has Java applets that allow users\nto manipulate flexible tilings.\n\nMost textbooks for general education mathematics\ncourses include sections that connect mathematics with other fields. For\ninstance, The\nHeart of Mathematics: An invitation to effective thinking by Edward\nB. Burger and Michael Starbird discusses the\nmathematics of bar codes, cryptography, geometry and art, fractals and chaos,\nand the likelihood of coincidences. A syllabus\nfor an interesting course that makes some use of this text is from Sarah\nGreenwald, Appalachian State University. Another text, Using\nand Understanding Mathematics by Jeffrey O. Bennett and William L.\nBriggs, University of Colorado at Boulder, contains sections on financial\nmanagement, modeling a variety of real-world situations, mathematics and art,\nmathematics and music, mathematics and politics, and mathematics and\nbusiness. See also the listings in this section under \"Introduce Contemporary\nTopics.\"\n\nIntroduce Contemporary Topics\n\nRobert Devaney, BostonUniversity, is a leader\nin promoting instruction in the contemporary topic of dynamical systems. In\naddition to his books and articles, talks, and professional development\ninstitutes, he has been director of the National Science Foundation's Dynamical Systems and Technology\nProject since 1989. The goal of this project is to show students and\nteachers how ideas from modern mathematics such as chaos, fractals, and\ndynamics, together with modern technology, can be used effectively in the\nhigh school and college curriculum.\n\nThe University of Maryland University College offers Mathematics\n\u2013 Contemporary Topics and Applications as both an in-class and\ndistance-learning first-year course. The course is a survey of contemporary\ntopics in mathematics, centering on applications and projects. Topics include\nmeasurements, rates of growth, basic statistics, the mathematics of political\npower, the geometry of the solar system, and computer arithmetic. The goals\nstate that after completing this course a student should be able to cite\nelements of good statistical design, undertake elementary statistical\nanalysis, and recognize and explain the shortcomings of unsound methods of\nstatistical analysis; mathematically analyze situations involving the\nweighting of power in various voting structures and implement apportionment\nof power strategies; and use the Pythagorean theorem and properties of\nsimilar triangles to calculate sizes of and distance between objects,\nincluding astronomical objects.\n\nStetsonUniversity offers a wide variety of\ncourses that meet the general mathematics requirement, including many\nthat discuss contemporary topics such as chaos and fractals, game theory, and\ncryptology.\n\nBoth of the popular texts For\nAll Practical Purposes, produced by the Consortium for Mathematics\nand Its Applications, and Excursions\nin Modern Mathematics by Peter Tannenbaum\nand Robert Arnold aim to convey insight about topics in contemporary\nmathematics and its applications to undergraduate students who have limited\nmathematical backgrounds. Topics in these books include the mathematics of\nvoting, fair division, and apportionment, applications of graph theory to\nmanagement science, fractal geometry, and statistics.\n\nAt Mount Holyoke College George Cobb teaches a course on the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method (MCMC), \"a very general and powerful method for\ncomputer simulation of situations that are too complicated to handle using\nmore conventional mathematical methods. MCMC has become a very active area of\nresearch at the interface of computer science and statistics, and has had a\npowerful impact on the practice of data analysis. As a method for computer\nsimulation, MCMC has very broad applicability. As a branch of mathematics,\nMCMC offers a number of compelling surprises \u2013 structures that on a concrete\nlevel seem quite different, but, viewed at the right level of abstraction, turn out to be different versions of the same\nidea.\"\n\nIn the article \"Geometric\nPhoto Manipulation\" Tom Farmer shows how calculus and linear algebra can\nbe used to manipulate photographs, a contemporary application with which many\nstudents have experience, thanks to currently available software.\n\nG.H. Hardy once proudly asserted that number theory\nwould never be applied. Yet today number theory has a range of important\napplications. Among these are cryptography (see, for example, lecture notes\nfrom two cryptography\ncourses by Ed Schaefer at Santa Clara University, the RSA website,\nand recent textbooks in number theory and discrete mathematics), and error\ndetection using check digits and error-correcting codes (see, for example, Numbers\nand symmetry: An Introduction to Algebraby\nBernard L. Johnston and Fred Richman and Contemporary\nAbstract Algebra by Joseph Gallian).\n\nEnhance Perception of Vitality and\nImportance of Mathematics\n\nThe World Wide Web provides a wealth of examples of the use and\napplicability of mathematics, but searching for appropriate illustrations can\nbe time consuming. There are several sites that focus on providing good\nexamples for instructors: Plus,\nan Internet magazine that aims to introduce readers to the beauty and the\npractical applications of mathematics; Mathematical Moments,\nan AMS program that offers a series of pdf files\nand podcasts to promote appreciation and\nunderstanding of the role mathematics plays in science, nature, technology,\nand human culture; and the Math Forum,\na center that provides resources, materials, activities, person-to-person\ninteractions, and educational products and services to enrich and support the\nteaching and learning of mathematics.\n\nChance\nNews is a monthly, on-line newsletter that provides abstracts of\narticles from current newspapers, the media, and journals, and suggests\ndiscussion questions for class use. It also includes links to related\nresources at other web sites. Since 1992, Chance News has been\nmaintained by J. Laurie Snell of DartmouthCollege. The\nexamples are current and can be used for student motivation, for class\ndiscussion, and as exercises in an introductory statistics course or\nprobability course. The website contains all issues of Chance News\nas well as information on signing up for the newsletter by e-mail.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAdditional information and resources on communicating the breadth and\ninterconnections of the mathematical sciences are in Part 2, Section C.3."}

It contains a large collection of examples and exercises, ranging from simple problems that allow students to check their understanding of the concepts to challenging problems that develop new material.\n\nProviding a solid foundation in analysis, A Concrete Introduction to Real Analysis demonstrates that the mathematical treatments described in the text will be valuable both for students planning to study more analysis and for those who are less inclined to take another analysis class."}
{"text": "The skills that students are practicing in related rates problems are:\n\nDifferentiating a known equation implicitly with respect to time.\n\nInterpreting the time derivative of a quantity as a rate of change.\n\nThe main reason that related rates problems feel so contrived is that calculus books do not want to assume that the students are familiar with any of the equations of science or economics. Every related rates problem inherently involves differentiating a known equation, and the only equations that the calculus book assumes are the equations of geometry.\n\nThus, you can find related rates problems involving various area and volume formulas, related rates problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem or similar triangles, related rates problems involving triangle trigonometry, and so forth. A few of these problems are compelling -- for example, computing the speed of an airplane based on ground observations of its altitude and apparent angular velocity -- but most of them do feel a bit contrived.\n\nThe reality, of course, is that students are familiar with many of the basic equations and concepts of science and economics, and there's no rule against using these in problems. For example, you can make up all sorts of compelling related rates problems by starting with any physics or chemistry equation and imagining a situation where you might want to take its derivative:\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the object is accelerating at a rate of $9.8 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$, how fast is the kinetic energy increasing when the speed is $30 \\;\\text{m}/\\text{s}$?\n\nAn ideal gas satisfies $PV = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R \\approx 8.314\\;\\; \\text{J}\\; \\text{mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$. Give the rate at which the temperature and volume of the gas are increasing, and then ask about the rate of change in pressure when the volume and temperature reach certain amounts.\n\nThe total energy stored in a capacitor is $\\frac{1}{2} Q^2 / C$, where $Q$ is the amount of charge stored in the capacitor and $C$ is the capacitance. Give the value of $C$ and the rate at which $Q$ is decreasing, and ask about the rate at which the capacitor is losing energy when the energy is a certain amount.\n\nIn astronomy, the absolute magnitude $M$ of a star is related to its luminosity $L$ by the formula\n$$\nM \\;=\\; M_{\\text{sun}} -\\; 2.5\\; \\log_{10}(L/L_{\\text{sun}}).\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\text{sun}} = 4.75$ and $L_{\\text{sun}} = 3.839 \\times 10^{26} \\text{watts}$. (Note that, by convention, brighter stars have lower magnitude.) If the absolute magnitude of a variable star is decreasing at a rate of $0.09 / \\text{week}$, how quickly is the luminosity of the star increasing when the magnitude is $3.8$?\n\nIt's easy to make these up: just think of any equation in science or economics whose derivative might be interesting.

{"text": "Mathematics\n\nMany of our students are destined to be leaders in fields where analytical and problem-solving skills are invaluable and specific applications of mathematics are often indispensable. In the Mathematics Department, we give each student the necessary tools to understand theories and appreciate applications. True problem-solving strength calls for a wide repertoire of knowledge. Students acquire a strong knowledge of mathematics through the study of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus.\n\nThis ability to solve problems is further strengthened by learning to discern relationships between particular skills and concepts and the fundamental principles that unify them. Students learn to formulate key questions, analyze data, and apply learned strategies to new situations. In doing so, students are equipped not only to solve mathematics problems, but also to use an analytical, well-thought-out approach in seeking solutions in other areas of life.\n\nAlgebra I\n\nThis class introduces the basic principles of future mathematics courses. Students transition from the concrete to the abstract through a wide range of problem-solving situations. The class emphasizes the concept of functions and covers the real number system, operations with positive and negative numbers, simplifying algebraic expressions, solving and graphing linear equations and inequalities, applying rules of exponents, understanding operations involving polynomials, simplifying rational expressions and square roots, and solving both rational and quadratic equations.\n\nAlgebra II\n\nThis second-year course in algebra aims for a mastery of the manipulative skills in real-number algebra as well as further develop problem-solving skills.

{"text": "Editorial Reviews\n\nAs far as math goes, McKellar knows her stuff. With two girlcentric, best-selling titles under her belt (Math Doesn't Suck, 2008, and Kiss My Math, 2009) and a degree in mathematics from UCLA, it is almost easy to forget that she was Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years. Facing down a 432-page book devoted to algebra could give even math whizzes pause, but McKellar makes it work, taking the textbook-meets-Seventeen approach by mixing the explanations and equations with boy talk, quizzes, and testimonials from successful women. While a tutor might use this title as a teaching aid, teen girls will want to explore it on their own. Navigation is easy; students are encouraged to hop from chapter to chapter as their homework demands. The breakdown of equations is effective and certainly unconventional\u2014explaining functions in terms of sausage factories, for example, or exponents in terms of whip-bearing female executives (makes sense in the book, promise)\u2014and while McKellar keeps her focus on how to solve math problems, her approach is both readable and even entertaining. --Courtney Jones\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBestMore About the Author\n\nBest known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from UCLA, went on to co-write a published math theorem, and continues to be an outspoken role model for young women to excel in math.\n\nMcKellar's 3rd and latest math book encourages teenage girls to outclass the boys in algebra. This can be an especially tough subject and she tackles it in a way that invites the outlandish idea of actually enjoying math.\n\nShe rejects the notion that excelling in algebra is all about natural gift. Rather, it's about determination and making an effort.\n\nWhile the sex-appeal of the book might be in question, ultimately this is a book broken down into straightforward language, easy charts and memorable reminders of the process of algebra.\n\nAdditionally, you'll find motivating stories from youthful female adults who've struggled with math, but learned to conquer their struggles. Danica proclaims. \"I'm here to tell you that giving up on ourselves because of our own stereotypes and limited imaginations is a far more destructive force than any challenge or obstacle 'out there,'\"\n\nOne bonus in the book is the inclusion of good tables and charts. These can be worth the price of the book alone. These succinctly explain the meaning of math terms such as fractions, coefficients and variables.\n\nA surprising aspect of the book is the authors inclusion of advice on how to choose the right guys to date. While she doesn't provide a mathematic formula for this it does seem she dispenses some basic common sense.\n\nWhat a great book to help tutor teen girls in math! It is organized well, so it is easy to navigate and you don't have to read it straight through. You can pick your topic and go back and forth with ease. The author is obviously a great teacher and knows her stuff. She combines that with her ability to reach out and grab the attention of teen girls and make math fun. A must have to share with the girls in your life!\n\nAt last, a book that teaches middle-school students and their parents in simple terms how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square and to solve the quadratic equation in standard form in X (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) to come up with the quadratic forumla. Most colleges and high schools do not teach this -- they just expect the student to know it.\n\nThe charter school I support plans to use Hot X: Algebra Exposed in concert with the first two books to ensure most or all Grade 8 students attain an A (93 or higher) in Algebra I.\n\nDanica McKellar needs to continue writing math books. Since these are such outstanding books, few state departments of education will adopt them for use, which means parents, other major care givers, and supportive businesses will have to come up with the funds to help schools with the purchase of these books. Not only should the schools have these books for use as textbooks, but individual students should have their own copy to help learn the material initially and to refresh key points as they complete Algebra II and beyond.\n\nDanica also has web sites that provide additional information for each book. Check out [...]. If you wish to provide input to Danica, you may send it to her at: share@danicamckellar.com."}
