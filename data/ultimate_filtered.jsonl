That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to \"demonstrate further\" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. \"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.\n\nOnly nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3.\n\nThat activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x.\n\n\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers.", "function_calling_score": 26.115342763873773, "score_breakdown": {"tier1": 0, "tier2": 0, "tier3": 60, "bonus": 0, "keywords": 8, "languages": 4}, "pattern_matches": {"Import statements": 5}, "quality_indicators": {"has_code_blocks": false, "has_function_definitions": false, "has_api_calls": false, "multi_language": false, "high_complexity": false, "detected_languages": ["sql"], "pattern_diversity": 1}, "segments_extracted": 11, "segment_types": {"sentence": 1, "paragraph": 1}, "original_length": 2757, "filtered_length": 3742, "compression_ratio": 1.357272397533551, "top_segment_scores": [225.35211267605635, 94.11764705882352, 82.90155440414507, 77.41935483870968, 77.34806629834254]}

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \"algebra\" broadly, defining it as a \"method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance\". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is \"the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge\" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions.

Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nWithout further discussion, let's look at some examples of how this can be done!

The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nOther times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nBefore you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nWhile they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1.\n\nThe distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nSometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17.\n\nA variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1.

Although our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province. For example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues.\nTo spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes.\nSeveral facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect. We are very interested in knowing if our efforts to bring the Mathematics closer to young people and teachers in schools are useful. Among the methods to know this we use:\n\nIn Spain, it is well known that secondary school students' motivation to study Science (especially Mathematics) is not very strong. This is a common problem to almost all Europe. Spanish and Andalusian governments have general policies on education to promote the study of Science. They are necessary and convenient. However, we think that local actions in the students' environment, which supplement these policies, are also needed.\nFor this reason, five years ago we founded at the University of Almería an online free journal called Boletín de la Titulación de Matemáticas de la UAL ( mainly addressed to those students. Our intention is to stimulate their interest in mathematics, to develop their mathematical skills, to complement their background, and to improve their perception and assessment of mathematics. Many aspects, usually out of the syllabus, are treated to provide a closer, more real and positive image of mathematics. Another aim is to encourage a closer contact between secondary schools and our university. Although these are our main goals, we do not discard a broader audience and often include articles appropriate for a general public.\nIt is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc. We do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country.\nBoletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world.\nThis project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system. There are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools. The secondary school students are, as said, the main target of this project, and they can participate through the mathematical contest that we pose. There exists a closer contact later in the prize award ceremony at the winner's secondary school. In such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers. No doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience. Regarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called \"Territorio Estudiante\" (Student Area).\nThe journal is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course (October, January and April). Its length is around 20-25 pages and papers published must be short and suitable for a secondary school level. It is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:\n\nThis project also includes visits to secondary schools, where the prize of the journal's mathematical contest is awarded to the winner and talks on popularization of Maths are delivered.\n\nStudent area, made itself by our undergraduate students and where, among other things, they speak about their experiences with mathematical studies and activities and interview Erasmus students and alumni.\n\nIt is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc.\n\nRegarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called \"Territorio Estudiante\" (Student Area).\n\nOur leitmotiv is to provide a closer, more objective, real and positive image of mathematics and help to improve its perception and assessment.", "function_calling_score": 27.820710973724886, "score_breakdown": {"tier1": 0, "tier2": 0, "tier3": 180, "bonus": 0, "keywords": 10, "languages": 8}, "pattern_matches": {"Import statements": 15}, "quality_indicators": {"has_code_blocks": false, "has_function_definitions": false, "has_api_calls": false, "multi_language": true, "high_complexity": false, "detected_languages": ["java", "sql"], "pattern_diversity": 1}, "segments_extracted": 20, "segment_types": {"sentence": 1, "paragraph": 1}, "original_length": 7117, "filtered_length": 8225, "compression_ratio": 1.1556835745398342, "top_segment_scores": [300.0, 144.3298969072165, 134.32835820895522, 121.2121212121212, 115.22633744855968]}

Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding.\nThis edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about.

From this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally. As students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them. Looking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.\n\nThe development of algebraic thinking is a process, not an event. It is something that can be part of a positive, motivating, enriching school mathematics experience. \"Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School\" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year. Watch for opportunities to develop your own understanding of this important topic throughout the year, including as part of conferences, journals, publications, and the NCTM Web site.\n\nThroughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well. As students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3. As they explore and understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they can look for patterns that help them learn procedures and facts. Patterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense. Patterns within the multiplication table itself are interesting to children and help them both learn their facts and understand relationships among facts. The process of noticing and exploring patterns sets the stage for looking at more complex relationships, including proportionality, in later grades.\n\nAlgebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change. Of course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems. But trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure. Algebraic thinking can begin when students begin their study of mathematics.\n\nAs students move into the middle grades, their mathematics experience can focus on connecting their work with numbers and operations to more symbolic work with equations and expressions. At this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum. This concept should take students well beyond the study of ratios, proportions, and percent. A real understanding of proportionality allows students to connect their experience with numbers and operations to ideas that they have studied in geometry, measurement, and data analysis. They begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.\n\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that is teaching courses with names like Algebra I or Algebra II. The rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school. In the United States, some schools offer an alternative, such as an integrated program that incorporates algebra as a strand blended with geometry and other advanced topics. Others continue to offer a course sequence that includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. In an increasing number of states, the study of algebra in some form is required of all students for high school graduation. Regardless of whether a school's secondary curriculum includes a separate course in Algebra I or is more integrated, we can take concrete steps to ensure that students will flourish and succeed when they arrive at the formal study of algebra. A key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.\n\nAs students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3.\n\nThroughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well.\n\nThis kind of categorizing and generalizing is an important developmental step on the journey toward algebraic thinking.\n\nLooking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.\n\nBut trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure.\n\nAs students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them.\n\nAt this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum.", "function_calling_score": 20.487460261391735, "score_breakdown": {"tier1": 0, "tier2": 40, "tier3": 60, "bonus": 0, "keywords": 12, "languages": 4}, "pattern_matches": {"HTTP methods with endpoints": 2, "Import statements": 5}, "quality_indicators": {"has_code_blocks": false, "has_function_definitions": false, "has_api_calls": true, "multi_language": false, "high_complexity": false, "detected_languages": ["sql"], "pattern_diversity": 2}, "segments_extracted": 20, "segment_types": {"sentence": 1, "paragraph": 1}, "original_length": 5662, "filtered_length": 6212, "compression_ratio": 1.0971388202048746, "top_segment_scores": [240.0, 192.98245614035088, 113.63636363636364, 103.22580645161291, 98.15950920245399]}

It is the student's responsibility to get any missed notes from a classmate. Missed exams or quizzes must be made up within one week. The student is expected to pursue and complete all missing assignments. Those not made up within the stated time frame will receive a score of Zero. d. ZANGLE and Student Connect. I post grades regularly on Zangle – usually within a week. e. Cheating Policy (VUSD) A student who attempts to or gains an unfair advantage over any other student because of unacceptable behavior is subject to the following: Level One - zero on the assignment or test, conference with the student, contact the parent and send copy of form B to both parent and the Assistant Principal Level Two - zero on the assignment, 2 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Three - zero on the assignment, 5 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Four – Student shall be transferred from the high school and placed in alternative placement 5. Rules and Expectations. My rules are fairly simple – RESPECT for all - This means treat others how you wish to be treated. Use appropriate language and tone. Respect property – DO YOUR BEST. What you get from this class depends largely on what you put into it! – SEEK RESOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS - don't ignore them, they could get worse. – FOLLOW CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS Students will be expected to · Be in their seatwhen the tardy bell rings, with BOOK, supplies, ready to begin · Participate in all class work. Stay focused. · Pay attention, take notes during instruction, and ask questions · Keep all electronic distractions in their backpacks. CD players, video games and cell phones will be turned over to their administrator if used during class · Stay in assigned seat until dismissed. -TARDY It is important to be on time and prepared for class when the bell rings. I keep track of tardy arrivals; you will be expected to serve a class detention for your tardies. 6. Consequences Failure to meet the above rules and expectations will result in disciplinary action, according to school policy. (Verbal reminder, conference, removal of privilege, phone call to Parents, counseling referral, administrative referral.) 7. SUPPLIES – to be well prepared, please bring to class ●A 3-ring binder: 2 inches is best. You'll be getting lots of papers. ●Dividers – separate notebook into Notes/Homework/Journals/Quizzes/Extra Paper ●Loose leaf paper ●Graph paper ●Pencils! # 2 pencils, an eraser and colored pencils (pens are not for math) ●Highlighters ●Book Cover – not the adhesive kind ●a Compass and Protractor ●A scientific calculator. I recommend the TI-30Xa or similar. 8. Contact information. Please contact me with any questions or concerns. Student success is the goal, and I am happy to discuss any ways to help your student succeed. 805-289-1842, ext 2151 or diane.elrod@venturausd.org my web page is vusdmathelrod.weebly.com Sincerely, Diane B.

{"text": "We could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc.\n\nBut it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.\n\nBut \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer.\n\nEven if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all.\n\nI think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with.\n\nContrast this with the approach of treating an equation like a puzzle. If \"2x - 3 = 5\", and we want to know what x is, there are many ways to approach the solution. We could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc. Some possible partial answers are, \"someone took away 3, so let's add it back\", or \"if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution\". But \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer. High scores don't mean anything, algebra does.\n\nFair enough; it's possible that you and I simply think in different ways. I personally find it very difficult to memorize (seemingly) arbitrary rules, and I found it very difficult to un-teach the \"guess the teacher's password\" mentality to people. But it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.\n\nJust because something doesn't teach everything about a subject doesn't make it a poor instructional aid. Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it. Even if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all. (Though if you end up struggling with the harder topics because you didn't have the rules of algebra appropriately memorized, you might never want to study more of it...)\n\nI disagree. I think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with. After all, his goal is to balance an equation, and look, he just balanced it... so what else is there to know ? Thus, the memorization approach creates the impression that math (or whatever subject you're studying) is all about arbitrary rules that make no sense; it's all about \"guessing the teacher's password\", and that's boring.\n\nAlgebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it.\n\n)\n\nAlgebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it.\n\nSome possible partial answers are, \"someone took away 3, so let's add it back\", or \"if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution\".\n\nBut I would still expect that if somebody first learned them as meaningless rules in the game, and was then later taught math and the reasons for the rules, they'd have a good chance of being delighted at discovering where the rules came from, and could spend all of their cognitive capacity on developing an actual understanding.", "function_calling_score": 32.74139844617092, "score_breakdown": {"tier1": 0, "tier2": 60, "tier3": 48, "bonus": 0, "keywords": 2, "languages": 8}, "pattern_matches": {"HTTP methods with endpoints": 3, "Import statements": 4}, "quality_indicators": {"has_code_blocks": false, "has_function_definitions": false, "has_api_calls": true, "multi_language": true, "high_complexity": false, "detected_languages": ["javascript", "sql"], "pattern_diversity": 2}, "segments_extracted": 13, "segment_types": {"sentence": 1, "paragraph": 1}, "original_length": 3604, "filtered_length": 4112, "compression_ratio": 1.1409544950055495, "top_segment_scores": [171.67381974248926, 152.38095238095238, 148.14814814814815, 100.33444816053512, 98.76543209876543]}

Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.)

With no representation theory, one cannot do much more than say \"the physicists use this a lot,\" without showing how or why. That seems like a pity.\n\nIn a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary.\n\nHowe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared.

Instead, I used the book in a seminar course that followed our standard one-semester introduction to abstract algebra. In the class were six seniors, three juniors, and (yes!) a sophomore; all had taken algebra, either in the previous semester or a year before. Most, but not all, had taken other advanced courses as well, including Real Analysis. My students were assigned problems to solve and present in class, and we developed the theory in that way. Every once in a while, I would step in and give a broader view.\n\nPollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book.

I graphed the first specific example on Desmos, talked through how I could visually \"see\" the 2 vertical asymptotes and 1 horizontal asymptote, showed them to graph those lines to confirm the asymptotic behavior, returned to the algebra of the example function to make connections between the algebra and the graph, then added a generalization to the board of noticing/wondering.\n\nSince I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit.

Do you intend to move away from the more specific clues? Is the unit long enough for that?\n* Love the writing on the second set of board snapshots.

I'm partial to GeoGebra myself.\n\nDuring the follow-up conversation at the end of class, I addressed all of the points on the board, asked for students to help respond to some of the questions, and felt that the majority of students left with a better understanding of both the important features of these graphs and how the algebra of the functions controls their shape.", "function_calling_score": 21.87884589087926, "score_breakdown": {"tier1": 0, "tier2": 80, "tier3": 48, "bonus": 0, "keywords": 12, "languages": 20}, "pattern_matches": {"HTTP methods with endpoints": 4, "Import statements": 4}, "quality_indicators": {"has_code_blocks": false, "has_function_definitions": false, "has_api_calls": true, "multi_language": true, "high_complexity": false, "detected_languages": ["python", "javascript", "java", "sql", "c++"], "pattern_diversity": 2}, "segments_extracted": 20, "segment_types": {"sentence": 1, "paragraph": 1}, "original_length": 7313, "filtered_length": 4621, "compression_ratio": 0.6318884178859565, "top_segment_scores": [240.0, 208.955223880597, 173.91304347826087, 128.78787878787878, 128.2051282051282]}

Once they were done, they could check the answer that is provided at each station. After the minute was over and students had checked their answers, I told them to rotate. They went to the next station and we did the process all over again.\n\nWhen you bring in a specific question to your math teacher they can help you with where you are struggling.

Applied Functional Analysis is a topic of great importance for a young computer scientist, especially one who is aspiring for a PhD, but it can be slow to grasp if you are taking it as an independent reading course.</p>\n by Scott Morrison for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forScott Morrison2009-10-25T18:34:40Z2009-10-25T18:34:40Z<p>One general advice about early maths education is to not decide what you like too early!</p>\n<p>Keep learning new fields, keep reading books about things you don't know yet. Most mathematicians I know aren't working on problems they would have expected when they arrived in grad school. It takes a surprisingly long time for most people to reach the level of mathematical maturity where they're reading to work on new problems, and until you have an inkling that you're ready for this, don't overspecialise.

There is so much out there that even the best mathematicians are limited in what they can understand well. So in terms of specific concept plateaus, well if you're like most of us you'll probably have lots of them, and that's a good thing.</p>\n<p>In terms of concepts, I think what I found tough was often much clearer after I lost an early misconception. E.g. for a long time I thought the Killing form in Lie algebra was using \"killing\" as a synonym for \"erasing\"... I tried to build my understanding around that conception and it didn't work very well (Killing is a name). A lot of \"simple\" mathematical ideas are known by proper names rather than descriptive terms, so as more of these accumulate you have to rely more on memorization than intuition.</p>\n<p>Outside of concepts, here's what I found tough:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transition from coursework to research.</strong> Some people are very good at getting the A when the material is put in front of them, and most textbooks are good at giving you the necessary tools to solve the problems they present. I found the transition to more open-ended problems a significant challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding the frontier of a field.</strong> As stated in a previous response, it's tough to get to the frontier of a field. It takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. So graduate school requires a lot of perseverance.</li>\n</ul>\n\nApplied Functional Analysis is a topic of great importance for a young computer scientist, especially one who is aspiring for a PhD, but it can be slow to grasp if you are taking it as an independent reading course.\n\nIt takes a surprisingly long time for most people to reach the level of mathematical maturity where they're reading to work on new problems, and until you have an inkling that you're ready for this, don't overspecialise.\n\n</p>\n<p>If I pursue a path towards graduate level studies, what sort of things should I watch out for?
