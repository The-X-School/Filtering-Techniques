{"text": "Since 1978, UW system faculty and Wisconsin high school teachers have been collaborating to develop a test for placing incoming students into college Mathematics courses. The current test includes four components: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. These components are available for each UW System campus to use according to its individual needs and resources. Each campus determines the appropriate scores for entry into specific courses. The purpose of this brochure is to introduce you to the test, describe the rationale behind its creation, and outline future plans for its continued development.\n\nIn 1978, following the publication of the UW System Basic Skills Task Force Report, members of Mathematics Department Faculties from UW System institutions met in Madison to discuss common entry-level curriculum problems. One problem most departments shared was how to effectively place incoming freshmen into an appropriate mathematics course. Placement procedures and tests varied from campus to campus and it seemed that some consistency was desirable. The decision was made to develop a System-wide test for placement into an introductory mathematics curriculum.\n\nThe committee that would begin this task would consist of representatives from any UW System Mathematics Department that chose to participate. The departments would select their representatives and participation would be strictly voluntary.\n\nThe first step in the project was to carefully analyze each of the individual curricula in the System and write a detailed set of prerequisite objectives for all courses prior to calculus. After this list was approved by all campuses, the committee began developing test items on the skills identified in their test objectives. Through a series of pilot administrations at area high schools and UW campuses, the committee obtained valuable information about how the individual items performed, and gained important insights into item writing strategies and techniques. Many items were refined or corrected, as necessary, and repiloted in an effort to improve their ability to distinguish between students with different levels of mathematical preparedness. After a sufficient number of high quality items had been developed, they were assembled into a complete test. The first operational form of the Mathematics Placement Test was administered in 1984.\n\nPlacement into college courses is the sole purpose of this test. The experienced teacher will quickly realize that many skills which are taught in the high school mathematics courses are not included in the test. This was by design, as the test is a tool to assist advisors in placing students into the best course in the university-level mathematics sequence. The questions on the test were specifically selected with this single purpose in mind. This means the test is not a measure of everything that is learned in high school Mathematics courses. The test was not designed to measure program success or to compare students from one high school with students from another. It should be viewed only as a tool to be used for placing students at the university level.\n\nAs a placement instrument, the test has to be easy enough to identify those students needing remedial help, yet it also has to be complex enough to identify those students who are ready for calculus. Scores have to be precise enough to allow placement into many different levels of university coursework. In addition, the test has to be efficient to score, since thousands of students each year need to have their results promptly reported. In order to meet these criteria, the test development committee selected a multiple-choice format. The items measure four different areas of mathematical competence: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. Each skill area has a different set of detailed objectives, carefully developed to best match university mathematics curricula across the University of Wisconsin System.\n\nEvery year, a new form of the Mathematics Placement Test is published, along with some new pilot items for each component of the test, and administered to all incoming Freshmen in the UW System. All items are subjected to a statistical review to identify which items effectively distinguish the students with the strongest mathematics skills or the weakest mathematics skills from the general population of students. Only the items which are most useful for differentiating among students are ever considered for use on a future form of the test.\n\nAlthough faculty cannot be considered disinterested observers, those who are familiar with the placement test feel that its quality is extremely high. The feeling among faculty at the participating UW institutions is that the test has helped enormously in placing students into appropriate courses. One of the strengths of the Mathematics Placement Test is that it is developed by faculty from throughout the University of Wisconsin System. Therefore, this test represents a UW System perspective with respect to the underlying skills that are necessary for success in our courses. One of the challenges, in this regard, is that the UW System campuses do not have a single Mathematics curriculum. Instead, each campus has its own curriculum and its own courses, which may or may not correspond well with courses on other UW campuses. To ensure that the placement test works well on each UW campus, each UW institution determines its own cutscores so as to optimize placement into its own Mathematics course sequence. Consequently, cutscores will vary from campus to campus as a result of curricular differences and student population differences. Also, on many campuses, the placement test is but one of several variables used for placing students, often also including ACT/SAT score, units of high school mathematics, and grades in high school mathematics courses.\n\nThe ability of this test to appropriately place students into courses rests in the quality of the match between test content and the institutional curricula at each UW campus. To ensure that the test mirrors the curriculum in introductory mathematics courses throughout UW System, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee has expanded to include one representative from most of the 14 UW institutions, as well as one Wisconsin high school mathematics teacher. This committee generally convenes twice each year to write and revise test items and discuss issues pertaining to test content and university curricula.\n\nOver the past few years, the Mathematics Placement Test has changed in several very important ways. Prior to the fall of 2000, the different campuses were combining items in different ways to form placement scores and make placement decisions. The particular set of items used by any one campus was selected to best match that campus' introductory curriculum. However, because campuses combined the test items in different ways, students who transferred from one UW institution to another often found themselves without valid placement scores and needing to retake the test. In 2000, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee agreed upon a common method for combining test objectives to create a uniform set of scores for reporting performance on the placement test. The three agreed-upon scores, one corresponding to each new objective, are labeled mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. These three scores are now used by all System institutions.\n\nHistorically, the Mathematics Placement Test has always been organized in three different sections, labeled A, B, and C. Students were instructed to take either sections A and B (which contained elementary and intermediate algebra) or sections B and C (which contained intermediate and college algebra and trigonometry), depending upon their mathematics background and desired college placement. However, our experience was that many students found it difficult to accurately assess their level of preparedness and would often take the wrong two sections. On most campuses, students who scored too high on the AB test or too low on the BC test could not be placed accurately and were required to retest with the appropriate two sections of the test. This was very inconvenient, both for the students and for the university's testing office. Beginning in the fall of 2002, the three different sections were shortened and combined, and all students were asked to complete the entire test. This has helped eliminate the confusion over which two sections to take and has reduced the number of students needing to retest.\n\n1. All items are to be completed by all students. The items are roughly ordered from elementary to advanced. The expectation is that less prepared students will answer fewer questions correctly than more prepared students.\n\n5. The mathematics basics component has a reliability of .85. The algebra component has a reliability of .90. The trigonometry component has a reliability of .85. For all three sections, items are selected of appropriate difficulty to provide useful information within the range of scores used for placement throughout the System campuses.\n\nThe Mathematics Test Development Committee decided on three broad categories of items: mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. The entire Mathematics Placement Test is designed to be completed in 90 minutes, sufficient time for most students to complete the test.\n\nItems for each of the three components are selected to conform to a carefully created set of detailed objectives. The percentage of items selected from each component are shown in Table 1 below.\n\nSample Items from the Trigonometry Component\n\nSample Trigonometry Items\n\nA high school calculus program not designed to generate college calculus credit is likely to mathematically disadvantage students who go on to college. This is true for all such students whose college program entails use of mathematics skills, and particularly true of students whose college program involves calculus. High school programs of this type tend to be associated with curtailed or superficial preparation at the precalculus level and their students tend to have algebra deficiencies which hamper them not only in mathematics courses but in other courses in which mathematics is used.\n\nThe positive side is that a well-conceived high school calculus course which generates college calculus credit for its successful students will provide a mathematical advantage to students who go on to college. A study by the Mathematical Association of America identified the following features of successful high school calculus programs:\n\n2. they are full year courses taught at the college level in terms of text, syllabus, depth and rigor.\n\n3. their instructors have had good mathematical preparation (e.g. at least one semester of junior/senior level real analysis) and are provided with additional preparation time.\n\n4. instructors expect that their successful graduates will not repeat the course in college, but will get college credit for it.\n\nA variety of special arrangements exist whereby successful graduates of a high school calculus course may obtain credit at one or another college. A generally accepted method is for the students to take the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board. Success rates of students on this exam can be a good tool for evaluation of the success of a high school calculus course.\n\nStill, there are reasons for maintaining a geometry course as an essential component in a college preparatory program. Since there are no entry level courses in geometry at the college level, it is essential that students master geometry objectives while in high school. High school geometry contributes to a level of mathematical maturity which is important for success in college.\n\nStudents should have the ability to use logic within a mathematical context, rather than the ability to do symbolic logic. The elements of logic which are particularly important include:\n\n3. Recognition that a general statement cannot be established by checking specific instances (unless the domain is finite), but that a general statement can be disproved by finding a single counter example. This should not discourage students from trying specific instances of a general statement to conjecture about its truth value.\n\nMoreover, logical thinking or logical reasoning as a method should permeate the entire curriculum. In this sense, logic cannot be restricted to a single topic or emphasized only in proof-based courses. Logical reasoning should be explicitly taught and practiced in the context of all topics. From this, students should learn that forgotten formulas can be recovered by reasoning from basic principles, and that unfamiliar or complex problems can be solved in a similar way.\n\nAlthough only two of the objectives explicitly refer to logic, the importance of logical thinking as a curriculum goal is not diminished. This goal, as well as other broad-based goals, is to be pursued despite the fact that it is not readily measured on placement tests.\n\nProblem solving involves the definition and analysis of a problem together with the selecting and combining of mathematical ideas leading to a solution. Ideally, a complete set of problem solving skills would appear in the list of objectives. The fact that only a few problem solving objectives appear in the list does not diminish the importance of problem solving in the high school curriculum. The limitations of the multiple choice format preclude the testing of higher level problem solving skills.\n\nMathematics is a basic skill of equal importance with reading, writing, and speaking. If basic skills are to be considered important and mastered by students, they must be encouraged and reinforced throughout the curriculum. Support for mathematics in other subject areas should include:\n\nThe impact of the computer on daily life is apparent, and consequently many high schools have instituted courses dealing with computer skills. While the learning of computer skills is important, computer courses should not be construed as replacements for mathematics courses.\n\nThere are occasions in college math courses when calculators are useful or even necessary (for example, to find values of trig functions), so students should be able to use calculators at a level consistent with the level at which they are studying mathematics (four-function calculators initially, scientific calculators in pre-calculus). A more compelling reason for being able to use calculators is that they will be needed in other courses involving applications of mathematics. The ability to use a calculator is very definitely a part of college preparation.\n\nOn the other hand, students need to be able to rapidly supply from their heads – whether by calculation or from memory – basic arithmetic, in order to be able to follow mathematical explanations. They should also know the conventional priority of arithmetic operations and be able to deal with grouping symbols in their heads. For example, students should know that (-3)2 s is 9, that -32 is -9, and that (-3)3 is -27 without needing to push buttons on their calculators. Moreover, students should be able to do enough mental estimation to check whether the results obtained via calculator are approximately correct.\n\nUse of scientific, non-graphing calculators is optional. Each student is advised to use or not use a calculator in a manner consistent with his or her prior classroom experience. Calculators will not be supplied at the test sites.\n\nMathematics curricula and faculty throughout UW are divided on whether or not to permit graphing calculators in classrooms. There remain many college-level courses for which graphing calculators are not allowed. Therefore, the placement test has not been revised to accommodate the use of graphing calculators. Students may not use graphing calculators for the Mathematics Placement Test.\n\nProbability and statistics are topics of value in the mathematical training of young people today that are not reflected on the placement test. It is the Committee's feeling that these topics are important to the elementary and secondary curriculum. They are gaining significance on university campuses, both within mathematics departments and within those departments not normally thought of as being quantitative in nature. The social sciences are seeking mathematical models to apply, and in general these models tend to be probabilistic or statistical. As a result, the curriculum in these areas is becoming heavily permeated with probability and statistics.\n\nMathematics departments are finding many of their graduates going into jobs utilizing computer science or statistics. Consequently, their curricula are beginning to reflect these trends. The Committee urges the educational community to develop and maintain meaningful instruction in probability and statistics.\n\nSignificant factors in the placement level of a student are the high school courses taken as well as whether or not mathematics was taken in the senior year. Data indicate that four years of college preparatory mathematics in high school not only raises the entry level mathematics course, but predicts success in other areas as well, including the ability to graduate from college in four years.\n\nThe purpose of this brochure is to introduce you to the test, describe the rationale behind its creation, and outline future plans for its continued development.\n\nBackground and Purpose of the Test\n\nIn 1978, following the publication of the UW System Basic Skills Task Force Report, members of Mathematics Department Faculties from UW System institutions met in Madison to discuss common entry-level curriculum problems\n\nPlacement procedures and tests varied from campus to campus and it seemed that some consistency was desirable\n\nThe decision was made to develop a System-wide test for placement into an introductory mathematics curriculum.\n\nThe committee that would begin this task would consist of representatives from any UW System Mathematics Department that chose to participate\n\nThe test was not designed to measure program success or to compare students from one high school with students from another\n\nAll items are subjected to a statistical review to identify which items effectively distinguish the students with the strongest mathematics skills or the weakest mathematics skills from the general population of students\n\nOne of the strengths of the Mathematics Placement Test is that it is developed by faculty from throughout the University of Wisconsin System\n\nConsequently, cutscores will vary from campus to campus as a result of curricular differences and student population differences\n\nTo ensure that the test mirrors the curriculum in introductory mathematics courses throughout UW System, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee has expanded to include one representative from most of the 14 UW institutions, as well as one Wisconsin high school mathematics teacher\n\nHowever, because campuses combined the test items in different ways, students who transferred from one UW institution to another often found themselves without valid placement scores and needing to retake the test\n\nThe items are roughly ordered from elementary to advanced\n\nThe percentage of items selected from each component are shown in Table 1 below.\n\nSample Items from the Trigonometry Component\n\nSample Trigonometry Items\n\nSample Geometry Items\n\nAdditional Statements About High School Preparation for College Mathematics Study\n\nCALCULUS\n\nThe number of high schools offering some version of calculus has increased markedly since the UW System Math Test Committee's first statement of objectives and philosophy, and experience with these courses has shown the validity of the Committee's original position\n\ninstructors expect that their successful graduates will not repeat the course in college, but will get college credit for it.\n\nA variety of special arrangements exist whereby successful graduates of a high school calculus course may obtain credit at one or another college\n\nThis should not discourage students from trying specific instances of a general statement to conjecture about its truth value.\n\nMoreover, logical thinking or logical reasoning as a method should permeate the entire curriculum\n\nFrom this, students should learn that forgotten formulas can be recovered by reasoning from basic principles, and that unfamiliar or complex problems can be solved in a similar way.\n\nAlthough only two of the objectives explicitly refer to logic, the importance of logical thinking as a curriculum goal is not diminished\n\nThe ability to use a calculator is very definitely a part of college preparation.\n\nOn the other hand, students need to be able to rapidly supply from their heads – whether by calculation or from memory – basic arithmetic, in order to be able to follow mathematical explanations\n\nData indicate that four years of college preparatory mathematics in high school not only raises the entry level mathematics course, but predicts success in other areas as well, including the ability to graduate from college in four years.\n\nTeachers should certainly feel free to encourage students to be well-rested and try to remain as relaxed as possible during the test", "programming_score": 13.966599752274377, "segments_extracted": 54, "original_length": 23413, "compressed_length": 21397}

{"text": "A discussion of what a good undergrad programme in\nmathematics should be about can be found here.\nThe book concerns mathematics in the American system, where applied\nmathematics was\nrarely taught in maths departments (at the time of writing). It also\ndiscusses the content often presented in four-year American liberal arts\ncolleges, and two-year community colleges, and criticises the specialist\nnature of the topics\nchosen. The courses offered to students of science and engineering by\ndepartments of mathematics are also panned, one point being that the\nprofessor doing this job knows no science or engineering at all.\n\nSome of the criticism of present methodology is way off centre. For\nexample, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using\nover-simplified models. He argues that there is no point teaching the laws\nof falling bodies as if there were no air friction: tell that to a\nparachutist, he quips. In this he fails to capture the essence of\nscience: we must study models, and compare with experiment, so that we may\nshoot them down, and revise them. More, we can usually find a range of\napplicability of\nthe simple model, outside of which it is no longer a good one. But\nworse: he seems to be saying that only a fully developed, correct model\nshould be taught. This goes against the teaching of Picasso: a teacher\nshould mix a little bit of what we do not know with a lot of what we do\nknow. I taught physics at Virginia Tech., a course in which the technician\nhad prepared the \"Galileo Bench\". This was an inclined plane on an air\ncushion, in which Galileo's laws of falling bodies, s = s(0) + vt + 1/2 at2,\nwas true, to within the experimental error. Some of the students\nfound these laws hard to understand, even without friction. When they had achieved\nthat, we went on to the refinements coming from friction. To start with\nthe full theory, would place them in a similar position to Galileo... who\nhad to cope with Aristotle's dictum that a force was needed to keep a\nbody moving; when Galileo had abandoned this, he broke the 2000 year stalemate\nin science.\n\nMost of the points made about the limited syllabus of a maths degree do\nnot apply to the UK, where applied\nmathematics traditionally forms half of the degree in\nmathematics. However, with the possible replacement of A-levels with a\nbacc., our school programme might become more like the American one. We\nshould then think about whether the university course might also move in\nthat direction. Should we have four-year degree courses in mathematics, with\nthe first year devoted to maths, physics, chemistry and computing? These\ncould cover the four subjects to replace the omitted parts of A-level. The\nmathematics course\ncould cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and\nstatistics,\ncomplex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices.\nPhysics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one\ndimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction,\nsimple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave\nmotion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations,\nand electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell). Chemistry might contain\nthe Bohr atom, the Mendeleev table, the inorganic chemistry of\nacids and bases, salts and metals. Some physical chemistry such as the law\nof mass-action, and some organic chemistry, should be\nincluded. Lab work in physics and chemistry should be at the\nlevel now done in schools in the UK. Computing might introduce a useful\nlanguage such as Java, Maple or Mathematica, and should give a general\ncompetence in Windows.\n\nKline suggests that scholarship in mathematics would serve a purpose,\nto reduce the number of pointless and empty papers, by critical reviews.\nThis used to be the job of Mathematical Reviews, until it changed its\npolicy, and now bans controversy in the reviews. Kline suggests that a new\ndegree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not\nrequire\noriginal theorems, but would be readable and deep. We have something\nsimilar, in\nthe M. Phil., which however has not got the status of the Ph. D.\n\nThe site of the University\nof Kentucky hosts a list of free material on mathematics, of which\nIII. above is just one. I found the course on partial\ndifferential equations very useful. The course\non Hilbert Space Methods for Partial Differential Equations, by\nR. E. Showalter, is very pleasant indeed. It is slightly informal in its\ndefinition\nof distributions, but this is all that is needed for partial\ndifferential equations at this level.\n\nFor\nexample, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using\nover-simplified models\n\nWhen they had achieved\nthat, we went on to the refinements coming from friction\n\nThe\nmathematics course\ncould cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and\nstatistics,\ncomplex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices.\nPhysics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one\ndimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction,\nsimple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave\nmotion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations,\nand electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell)\n\nKline suggests that a new\ndegree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not\nrequire\noriginal theorems, but would be readable and deep", "programming_score": 16.2714211528475, "segments_extracted": 9, "original_length": 5777, "compressed_length": 5355}

{"text": "The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\"\n\nIt has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has\n\nIt introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\nReadership\n\nUndergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers\n\nIt is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in", "programming_score": 19.71383147853736, "segments_extracted": 9, "original_length": 3145, "compressed_length": 4039}

{"text": "My Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nFor question A, some representative responses:\n\nSome responses for Question B:\n\nSome responses for Question C\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading.

{"text": "The corresponding material for the Foundation level syllabus is divided into seven sections; there are minor differences in the sequence and headings, resulting in the following list:\n\nRelations, functions and graphs\n\nThe listing by content area is intended to give mathematical coherence to the syllabuses, and to help teachers locate specific topics (or check that topics are not listed). The content areas are reasonably distinct, indicating topics with different historical roots and different main areas of application. However, they are inter-related and interdependent, and it is not intended that topics would be dealt with in total isolation from each other. Also, while the seven or eight areas, and the contents within each area, are presented in a logical sequence ­ combining, as far as possible, a sensible mathematical order with a developmental one for learners ­ it is envisaged that many content areas listed later in the syllabus would be introduced before or alongside those listed earlier. (For example, geometry appears near the end of the list, but the course committee specifically recommends that introductory geometrical work is started in First Year, allowing plenty of time for the ideas to be developed in a concrete way, and thoroughly understood, before the more abstract elements are introduced.) However, the different order of listing for the Foundation level syllabus does reflect a suggestion that the introduction of some topics (notably formal algebra) might be delayed. Some of these points are taken up in Section 4.\n\nAppropriate pacing of the syllabus content over the three years of the junior cycle is a challenge. Decisions have to be made at class or school level. Some of the factors affecting the decisions are addressed in these Guidelines in Section 4, under the heading of planning and organisation.\n\nThe importance of the changes in this area is reflected in two developments. First, a set of guidelines on calculators is being produced. It addresses issues such as the purchase of suitable machines as well as the rationale for their use. Secondly, in 1999 the Department of Education and Science commissioned a research project to monitor numeracy-related skills (with and without calculators) over the period of introduction of the revised syllabuses. If basic numeracy and mental arithmetic skills are found to disimprove, remedial action may have to be taken. It is worth noting that research has not so far isolated any consistent association between calculator use in an education system and performance by students from that system in international tests of achievement.\n\nMathematical tables are not mentioned in the content sections of the syllabus, except for a brief reference indicating that they are assumed to be available, likewise for appropriate use. Teachers and students can still avail of them as learning tools and for reference if they so wish. Tables will continue to be available in examinations, but questions will not specifically require students to use them.\n\nThe approach to synthetic geometry was one of the major areas which had to be confronted in revising the syllabuses. Evidence from examination scripts suggested that in many cases the presentation in the 1987 syllabus was not being followed in the classroom. In particular, in the Higher level syllabus, the sequence of proofs and intended proof methods were being adapted. Teachers were responding to students' difficulties in coping with the approach that attempted to integrate transformational concepts with those more traditionally associated with synthetic geometry, as described in Section 1.1 of these Guidelines.\n\nFor years, and all over the world, there have been difficulties in deciding how ­ indeed, whether ­ to present synthetic geometry and concepts of logical proof to students of junior cycle standing. Their historical importance, and their role as guardians of one of the defining aspects of mathematics as a discipline, have led to a wish to retain them in the Irish mathematics syllabuses; but the demands made on students who have not yet reached the Piagetian stage of formal operations are immense. \"Too much, too soon\" not only contravenes the principle of learnability (section 2.5), but leads to rote learning and hence failure to attain the objectives which the geometry sections of the syllabuses are meant to address. The constraints of a minor revision precluded the question of \"whether\" from being asked on this occasion. The question of \"how\" raises issues to do with the principles of soundness versus learnability. The resulting formulation set out in the syllabus does not claim to be a full description of a geometrical system. Rather, it is intended to provide a defensible teaching sequence that will allow students to learn geometry meaningfully and to come to realise the power of proof. Some of the issues that this raises are discussed in Appendix 2.\n\nThe approach omits the transformational elements, returning to a more traditional approach based on congruency.\n\nIn the interests of consistency and transfer between levels, the underlying ideas are basically the same across all three syllabuses, though naturally they are developed to very different levels in the different syllabuses.\n\nThe system has been carefully formulated to display the power of logical argument at a level which ­ hopefully ­ students can follow and appreciate. It is therefore strongly recommended that, in the classroom, material is introduced in the sequence in which it is listed in the syllabus document. For theHigher level syllabus, the concepts of logicalargument and rigorous proof are particularlyimportant. Thus, in examinations, attempted proofsthat presuppose \"later\" material in order to establish\"earlier\" results will be penalised. Moreover, proofsusing transformations will not be accepted.\n\nTo shorten the Higher level syllabus, only some of the theorems have been designated as ones for which students may be asked to supply proofs in the examinations. The other theorems should still beproved as part of the learning process;students should be able to follow the logical development, and see models of far more proofs than they are expected to reproduce at speed under examination conditions. The required saving of time is expected to occur because students do not have to put in the extra effort needed to develop fluency in writing out particular proofs.\n\nStudents taking the Ordinary and (a fortiori)Foundation level syllabuses are not required to prove theorems, but ­ in accordance with the level-specific aims (Section 2.4) ­ should experience the logical reasoning involved in ways in which they can understand it. The general thrust of the synthetic geometry section of the syllabuses for these students is not changed from the 1987 versions.\n\nTransformation geometry still figures in the syllabuses, but is treated separately from the formal development of synthetic geometry. The approach is intended to be intuitive, helping students to develop their visual and spatial ability. There are opportunities here to build on the work on symmetry in the primary curriculum and to develop aesthetic appreciation of mathematical patterns.\n\nThe coverage of statistics and data handling is increased. These topics can easily be related to students' everyday lives, and so can help students to recognise the relevance of mathematics. They lend themselves also to active learning methods (such as those presented in Section 4) and the use of spatial as well as computational abilities. Altogether, therefore, the topics provide great scope for enhancing students' enjoyment and appreciation of mathematics. They also give opportunities for developing suitably concrete approaches to some of the more abstract material, notably algebra and functions (see Section 4.8).\n\nGeneral objectives B and C of the syllabus refer respectively to instrumental understanding (knowing \"what\" to do or \"how\" to do it, and hence being able to execute procedures) and relational understanding (knowing \"why\", understanding the concepts of mathematics and the way in which they connect with each other to form so-called \"conceptual structures\"). When people talk of teaching mathematics for ­ or learning it with ­ understanding, they usually mean relational understanding. The language used in the Irish syllabuses to categorise understanding is that of Skemp; the objectives could equally well have been formulated in terms of \"procedures\" and \"concepts\".\n\nResearch points to the importance of both kinds of understanding, together with knowledge of facts (general objective A), as components of mathematical proficiency, with relational understanding being crucial for retaining and applying knowledge. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, indicated that Irish teachers regard knowledge of facts and procedures as particularly important ­ unusually so in international terms; but it would appear that less heed is paid to conceptual/relational understanding. This is therefore given special emphasis in the revised syllabuses. Such understanding can be fostered by active learning, as described and illustrated in Section 4. Ways in which relational understanding can be assessed are considered in Section 5.\n\nGeneral objective H of the syllabus indicates that students should be able to communicate mathematics, both verbally and in written form, by describing and explaining the mathematical procedures they undertake and by explaining their findings and justifying their conclusions. This highlights the importance of students expressing mathematics in their own words. It is one way of promoting understanding; it may also help students to take ownership of the findings they defend, and so to be more interested in their mathematics and more motivated to learn.\n\nThe importance of discussion as a tool for ongoing assessment of students' understanding is highlighted in Section 5.2. In the context of examinations, the ability to show different stages in a procedure, explain results, give reasons for conclusions, and so forth, can be tested; some examples are given in Section 5.6.\n\nGeneral objective I of the syllabus refers to appreciating mathematics. As pointed out earlier, appreciation may develop for a number of reasons, from being able to do the work successfully to responding to the abstract beauty of the subject. It is more likely to develop, however, when the mathematics lessons themselves are pleasant occasions.\n\nIn drawing up the revised syllabus and preparing the Guidelines, care has been taken to include opportunities for making the teaching and learning of mathematics more enjoyable. Enjoyment is good in its own right; also, it can develop students' motivation and hence enhance learning. For many students in the junior cycle, enjoyment (as well as understanding) can be promoted by the active learning referred to above and by placing the work in appropriate meaningful contexts. Section 4 contains many examples of enjoyable classroom activities which promote both learning and appreciation of mathematics. Teachers are likely to have their own battery of such activities which work for them and their classes. It is hoped that these can be shared amongst their colleagues and perhaps submitted for inclusion in the final version of the Guidelines.\n\nOf course, different people enjoy different kinds of mathematical activity. Appreciation and enjoyment do not come solely from \"games\"; more traditional classrooms also can be lively places in which teachers and students collaborate in the teaching and learning of mathematics and develop their appreciation of the subject. Teachers will choose approaches with whichthey themselves feel comfortable and which meet thelearning needs of the students whom they teach.\n\nThe changes in content and emphasis within the revised Junior Certificate mathematics syllabuses are intended, inter alia, to follow on from and build on the changes in the primary curriculum. The forthcoming alterations (scheduled to be introduced in 2002, but perhaps starting earlier in some classrooms, as teachers may anticipate the formal introduction of the changes) will affect the knowledge and attitudes that students bring to their second level education. Second level teachers need to be prepared for this. A summary of the chief alterations is given below; teachers are referred to the revised Primary School Curriculum for further details.\n\nlearning through hands-on activities (using concrete materials/manipulatives, and so forth)\n\nintroduction of the calculator from Fourth Class (augmenting, not replacing, paper-and-pencil techniques)\n\nThe treatment of subtraction emphasises the \"renaming\" or \"decomposition\" method (as opposed to the \"equal additions\" method ­ the one which uses the terminology \"paying back\") even more strongly than does the 1971 curriculum. Use of the word \"borrowing\" is discouraged.\n\nThe following topics are among those excluded from the revised curriculum:\n\n(Some of these topics were not formally included in the 1971 curriculum, but appeared in textbooks and were taught in many classrooms.)\n\nFinally, in this section, the content of the syllabuses is related to the aims and objectives. In fact most aims and objectives can be addressed in most areas of the syllabuses. However, some topics are more suited to the attainment of certain goals or the development of certain skills than are others. The discussion below highlights some of the main possibilities, and points to the goals that might appropriately be emphasised when various topics are taught and learnt. Phrases italicised are quoted or paraphrased from the aims as set out in the syllabus document. Section 5 of these Guidelines indicates a variety of ways in which achievement of the relevant objectives might be encouraged, tested or demonstrated.\n\nSets provide a conceptual foundation for mathematics and a language by means of which mathematical ideas can be discussed. While this is perhaps the main reason for which set theory was introduced into school mathematics, its importance at junior cycle level can be described rather differently.\n\nSet problems, obviously, call for skills of problem-solving; in particular, they provide occasions for logical argument. By using data gathered from the class, they even offer opportunities for simple introduction to mathematical modelling in contexts to which the students can relate.\n\nMoreover, set theory emphasises aspects of mathematics that are not purely computational. Sets are about classification, hence about tidiness and organisation. This can lead toappreciation of mathematics on aesthetic grounds and can help to provide a basis forfurther education in the subject.\n\nAn additional point is that this topic is not part of the Primary School Curriculum, and so represents a new start, untainted by previous failure. For some students, therefore, there are particularly important opportunities for personal development.\n\nWhile mathematics is not entirely quantitative, numeracy is one of its most important aspects. Students have been building up their concepts of numbers from a very early stage in their lives. However, moving from familiarity with natural numbers (and simple operations on them) to genuine understanding of the various forms in which numbers are presented and of the uses to which they are put in the world is a considerable challenge.\n\nThe aspect of \"understanding\" is particularly important ­ or, perhaps, has had its importance highlighted ­ with advances in technology.\n\nThe availability of calculators may remove some of the drudgery that can be associated with realistic problems, helping the students to focus on the concepts and applications that bring the topics to life.\n\nAlgebra was developed because it was needed ­ because arguments in natural language were too clumsy or imprecise. It has become one of the most fundamental tools for mathematics.\n\nAs with number, therefore, confidence andcompetence are very important. Lack of these underminethepersonal development of the students by depriving them of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed forcontinuing their education and for life and work.\n\nIt is thus particularly important that students develop appropriate understanding of the basics of algebra so that algebraic techniques are carried out meaningfully and not just as an exercise in symbol-pushing.\n\nOne of the ways in which the world is interpreted for us mathematically is by the use of statistics. Their prevalence, in particular on television and in the newspapers, makes them part of the environment in which children grow up, and provides students with opportunities for recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nStudents can provide data for further examples from their own backgrounds and experiences.\n\nPresenting these data graphically can extend students'powers of communication and their ability to shareideas with other people, and may also provide anaesthetic element.\n\nThe study of geometry builds on the primary school study of shape and space, and hence relates to mathematics in the world around us. In the junior cycle, different approaches to geometry address different educational goals.\n\nOther students may not consider formal proof, but should be able to draw appropriate conclusions from given geometrical data.\n\nExplaining and defending their findings, in either case, should help students to further their powersof communication.\n\nWith the possibility of using transformations in artistic designs, it allows students to encounter creative aspectsof mathematics and to develop or exercise their own creative skills.\n\nIts connections with functions and trigonometry, as well as algebra and geometry, make it a powerful tool for the integration of mathematics into a unified structure.\n\nIt provides an important foundation for appropriatestudies later on.\n\nTrigonometry is a subject that has its roots in antiquity but is still of great practical use to-day. While its basic concepts are abstract, they can be addressed through practical activities.\n\nThe concept of a function is crucial in mathematics, and students need a good grasp of it in order to prepare a firm foundation for appropriate studies lateron and in particular, a basis for further education inmathematics itself.\n\nThe representation of functions by graphs adds a pictorial element that students may find aesthetic as well as enhancing their understanding and their abilityto handle generalisations.\n\nThis topic pulls together much of the groundwork done elsewhere, using the tools introduced and skills developed in earlier sections and providing opportunities forproblem-solving and simple modelling.\n\nThe foregoing argument presents just one vision of the rationale for including the various topics in the syllabus and for the ways in which the aims of the mathematics syllabus can be achieved. All teachers will have their own ideas about what can inspire and inform different topic areas. Their own personal visions of mathematics, and their particular areas of interest and expertise, may lead them to implement the aims very differently from the way that is suggested here. Visions can profitably be debated at teachers' meetings, with new insights being given and received as a result.\n\nHowever, they are inter-related and interdependent, and it is not intended that topics would be dealt with in total isolation from each other\n\nIt is worth noting that research has not so far isolated any consistent association between calculator use in an education system and performance by students from that system in international tests of achievement.\n\nMathematical tables are not mentioned in the content sections of the syllabus, except for a brief reference indicating that they are assumed to be available, likewise for appropriate use\n\nTables will continue to be available in examinations, but questions will not specifically require students to use them.\n\nGeometry\n\nThe approach to synthetic geometry was one of the major areas which had to be confronted in revising the syllabuses\n\nEvidence from examination scripts suggested that in many cases the presentation in the 1987 syllabus was not being followed in the classroom\n\nThe constraints of a minor revision precluded the question of \"whether\" from being asked on this occasion\n\nThe required saving of time is expected to occur because students do not have to put in the extra effort needed to develop fluency in writing out particular proofs.\n\nStudents taking the Ordinary and (a fortiori)Foundation level syllabuses are not required to prove theorems, but ­ in accordance with the level-specific aims (Section 2.4) ­ should experience the logical reasoning involved in ways in which they can understand it\n\nThe general thrust of the synthetic geometry section of the syllabuses for these students is not changed from the 1987 versions.\n\nIt may be noted that the formulation of the Foundation level syllabus in 1987 emphasised the learning process rather than the product or outcomes\n\nIt is important to emphasise that the changed formulation in the syllabus is not meant to point to a more formal presentation than previously suggested for Foundation level students.\n\nSection 4.9 of this document contains a variety of suggestions as to how the teaching of synthetic geometry to junior cycle students might be addressed.\n\nTransformation geometry still figures in the syllabuses, but is treated separately from the formal development of synthetic geometry\n\nAs pointed out earlier, appreciation may develop for a number of reasons, from being able to do the work successfully to responding to the abstract beauty of the subject\n\nExamples are given in Section 5.\n\n3.4 CHANGES IN THE PRIMARY CURRICULUM\n\nThe changes in content and emphasis within the revised Junior Certificate mathematics syllabuses are intended, inter alia, to follow on from and build on the changes in the primary curriculum\n\nA summary of the chief alterations is given below; teachers are referred to the revised Primary School Curriculum for further details.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nIn the revised curriculum, the main changes of emphasis are as follows.\n\nThere is more emphasis on\n\nsetting the work in real-life contexts\n\nlearning through hands-on activities (using concrete materials/manipulatives, and so forth)\n\nunderstanding (in particular, gaining appropriaterelational understanding as well as instrumentalunderstanding)\n\nappropriate use of mathematical language\n\nrecording\n\nproblem-solving.\n\nThere is less emphasis on\n\nlearning routine procedures with no context provided\n\ndoing complicated calculations.\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nThe changes in emphasis are reflected in changes to the content, the main ones being as follows.\n\nNew areas include\n\nintroduction of the calculator from Fourth Class (augmenting, not replacing, paper-and-pencil techniques)\n\n(hence) extended treatment of estimation;\n\nincreased coverage of data handling\n\nintroduction of basic probability (\"chance\").\n\nNew terminology includes\n\nthe use of the \"positive\" and \"negative\" signs for denoting a number (as in +3 [positive three], -6 [negative six] as well as the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" signs for denoting an operation (as in 7 + 3, 24 ­ 9)\n\nexplicit use of the multiplication sign in formulae (as in 2 ×r , l ×w).\n\nThe treatment of subtraction emphasises the \"renaming\" or \"decomposition\" method (as opposed to the \"equal additions\" method ­ the one which uses the terminology \"paying back\") even more strongly than does the 1971 curriculum\n\nUse of the word \"borrowing\" is discouraged.\n\nThe following topics are among those excluded from the revised curriculum:\n\nunrestricted calculations (thus, division is restricted to at most four-digit numbers being divided by at most two-digit numbers, and ­ for fractions ­ to division of whole numbers by unit fractions)\n\n(Some of these topics were not formally included in the 1971 curriculum, but appeared in textbooks and were taught in many classrooms.)\n\nNOTE\n\nThe reductions in content have removed some areas of overlap between the 1971 Primary School Curriculum and the Junior Certificate syllabuses\n\nPhrases italicised are quoted or paraphrased from the aims as set out in the syllabus document\n\nBy using data gathered from the class, they even offer opportunities for simple introduction to mathematical modelling in contexts to which the students can relate.\n\nMoreover, set theory emphasises aspects of mathematics that are not purely computational\n\nStudents have been building up their concepts of numbers from a very early stage in their lives\n\nHowever, moving from familiarity with natural numbers (and simple operations on them) to genuine understanding of the various forms in which numbers are presented and of the uses to which they are put in the world is a considerable challenge.\n\nWeakness in this area destroys students' confidence andcompetence by depriving them of theknowledge, skillsand understanding needed for continuing theireducation and for life and work\n\nTheir prevalence, in particular on television and in the newspapers, makes them part of the environment in which children grow up, and provides students with opportunities for recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nMany of the examples refer to the students' typical areas of interest; examples include sporting averages and trends in purchases of (say) CDs.\n\nStudents can provide data for further examples from their own backgrounds and experiences.\n\nPresenting these data graphically can extend students'powers of communication and their ability to shareideas with other people, and may also provide anaesthetic element.\n\nThe fact that statistics can help to develop a positiveattitude towards mathematics as an interesting andvaluable subject of study ­ even for weaker students who find it hard to appreciate the more abstract aspects of the subject ­ explains the extra prominence given to aspects of data handling in the Foundation level syllabus, as mentioned earlier\n\nIn the junior cycle, different approaches to geometry address different educational goals.\n\nMore able students address one of the greatest of mathematical concepts, that of proof, and hopefully come to appreciate theabstractions andgeneralisations involved.\n\nOther students may not consider formal proof, but should be able to draw appropriate conclusions from given geometrical data.\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nExplaining and defending their findings, in either case, should help students to further their powersof communication.\n\nTackling \"cuts\" and other exercises based on the geometrical system presented in the syllabus allows students to develop their problem-solving skills.\n\nMoreover, in studying synthetic geometry, students are encountering one of the great monuments to intellectual endeavour: a very special part of Western culture.\n\nTransformation geometry builds on the study of symmetry at primary level\n\nAs the approach to transformation geometry in the revised Junior Certificate syllabus is intuitive, it is included in particular for its aesthetic value.\n\nWith the possibility of using transformations in artistic designs, it allows students to encounter creative aspectsof mathematics and to develop or exercise their own creative skills.\n\nIt can also develop their spatial ability, hopefully promotingconfidence and competence in this area.\n\nInstances of various types of symmetry in the natural and constructed environment give scope for students' recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nCoordinate geometry links geometrical and algebraic ideas\n\nWhile its basic concepts are abstract, they can be addressed through practical activities.\n\nSituations to which it can be applied ­ for example, house construction, navigation, and various ball games ­ include many that are relevant to the students' life, work and leisure.\n\nIt can therefore promote the students' recognition andenjoyment of mathematics in the world around them.\n\nWith the availability of calculators, students may more easily develop competence and confidence through their work in this area.\n\nFUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS\n\nThe concept of a function is crucial in mathematics, and students need a good grasp of it in order to prepare a firm foundation for appropriate studies lateron and in particular, a basis for further education inmathematics itself.\n\nThe representation of functions by graphs adds a pictorial element that students may find aesthetic as well as enhancing their understanding and their abilityto handle generalisations.\n\nThis topic pulls together much of the groundwork done elsewhere, using the tools introduced and skills developed in earlier sections and providing opportunities forproblem-solving and simple modelling.\n\nFor Foundation students alone, simple work on the set-theoretic treatment of relations has been retained\n\nTheir own personal visions of mathematics, and their particular areas of interest and expertise, may lead them to implement the aims very differently from the way that is suggested here", "programming_score": 12.374418034795392, "segments_extracted": 74, "original_length": 32648, "compressed_length": 29153}

{"text": "So I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory.

I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding.

It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.\n\nWe just switched to Saxon month a few months ago.

Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. SuzukiFALL 2010 V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Bailey (Anthropology) syllabus An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. HawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology) syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.\n\nNote: Previously listed as Conversations of the West\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness…\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Spectatorship—Ethics, Politics, Aesthetics Prof. Harries (English) syllabus Are you responsible for what you see? Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Throughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds. These thinkers will, in turn, challenge us to think about the function of images in the present. Readings and films: Plato's Republic, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Rousseau's Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What do we need to function as citizens of a democracy--capacities of reason, imagination, or eloquence? Skills in analyzing public discourse or habits of historical memory? Is belief in God required, or particular emotional tendencies or sympathies? What kind of humanistic values, if any, can and should a democracy promote? We examine these questions on the assumption that intensive close reading (and listening, in Mozart's case) promotes the habits of engaged, articulate talking and writing that are the bedrock of civic education. Music of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Bolduc (French) syllabus Explores how books give shape, meaning, and purpose to the world and human experience. As it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed. Grouped under four main themes--epic and the human experience, tales of beginnings and ends, battles for truth, writings of the self--we consider the purpose of this conversation between writers of different epochs and its relevance for understanding our own culture. Reading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative and Western Thought Prof. Weiler (Law) syllabus Issue of justice and injustice and other normative concerns. Each week pairs a core reading from the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament with another work in the Western tradition to explore a broad range of complex normative issues. Often God will be \"on trial:\" Was the Deluge genocide? Is Abraham guilty of attempted murder and child abuse? Was Jesus guilty as charged? Was Socrates? The themes are all of relevance to contemporary issues: communal responsibility vs. individual autonomy, ecological crisis, ethics vs. religion, freedom of speech and thought, genocide, rule of law and civil disobedience, the Other, punishment and retribution, religious intolerance, sanctity of human life, sex and gender. The course will be taught at the Law School in Law School style—rigourous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Primary readings include: Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology; Xenophon's Apology; Sophocles' Antigone; selections from Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Kierkegaard, Mill, Thoreau, Kafka, Camus.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Free Will in Western Thought Prof. Krabbenhoft (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus The freedom of the human will has been a foundational premise of Western civilization from the early centuries of the Christian era to the present, and yet it has been questioned and even rejected by some of the most influential thinkers of the modern period. We look at the sources of the modern debate in passages from the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, in key texts by Augustine, Luther, and Erasmus, and in the shift toward a deontological view in Kant, Schopenhauer, and nineteenth-century materialism. From this historical overview we move to contemporary theories of freedom and determinism, as well as a discussion of the intersection of neuroscience and the philosophy of free will, and read a number of literary texts in the light of theory: Sophocles' Philoctetes, Tirso de Molina's Trickster of Seville, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom—freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind—as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.\n\nSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition—science and technology—rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau.\n\nNote: Previously listed as World Cultures\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority—some 60%—of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0506 Cultures and Contexts: Chinese and Japanese Traditions Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus Essential aspects of Asian culture—Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0509 Cultures and Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0515 Cultures and Contexts: Latin America Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus Spanish, African, and Amerindian Sources of Latin American Identities. Explores the emergence of contemporary Latin America through the past and present doings of its persons and their representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature. Through in-depth treatment of selected cases, and via the perspectives of history, anthropology, and cultural criticism, focusing on texts but also film, dance, music, and performance, the aims is both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness (and of global modernity) in the historical confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national integration. At base, we seek to answer more fundamental questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of so-called globalization? Includes frank and explicit discussion of race, sex, and religion.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus A range of intersecting questions concerning the African Diaspora and what it produces: What does the trans-Atlantic slave trade create in the early modern and modern world? How is our understanding of trade, culture, capitalism, justice, race, gender, and work shaped by the histories of dispersal that characterize the Atlantic World? What aspects of culture, politics, identity, and social formations are illuminated when we think critically about the African Diaspora and the forces that propel it?\n\nFall 2010 V55.0541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish & Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Morris (ISAWFALL 2010 V55.0546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Hull (History) syllabus Focuses on several major African cultures that influenced each other's development from the pre-colonial through the postcolonial eras. These multi-dimensional cultures are examined through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, and museum artifacts, with emphasis on concepts of cultural identity and interchange, modernization, and cosmopolitanism. Africa is examined not only within the context of indigenous cultures but within the context of the world at large. In this vein, we weigh the contributions African cultures made to each other but also to the wider world.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0510 Cultures and Contexts: Russia—between East and West Prof. Borenstein (Russian & Slavic Studies)syllabus What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West), or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very beginnings to the present day.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0512 Cultures and Contexts: China Prof. Button (East Asian Studies) syllabus However one might choose to define the nature of human being, no one is ever merely human. Apart from whatever common essence we may be said to share, we are always also a combination of racial, ethnic, national, and gender differences. Over the course of several millennia Chinese culture has produced different conceptions of human being. We explore the variety of ways those conceptions have changed over time. Central to our inquiry is the question of how contending visions of the human are expressed and contested in different kinds of philosophical and literary texts, as well as artistic works in other media, including visual culture and film. Our guiding focus is on how ideas about human being in China have shaped gender roles and relations, the discourses of spirituality and the supernatural, as well as modern problems of race, nationalism, and revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Rosaldo and Prof. Gaytan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Addresses immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, testimonials, identities, popular culture, and language. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws on readings from imaginative literature to social science, we explore Latino communities in the United States and the issues that divide and unite them.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0533 Cultures and Contexts: Iran Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran: For 2500 years, the culture and civilization of Iran, (known in the West prior to World War II as Persia), has survived innumerable attacks and vicissitudes, which swept away many other cultures, languages, and nations. The first empire in human history to be multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious, based on tolerance, expanded ultimately to encompass all the lands from the Hindu Kush to North Africa. Emphasizing the growth of ancient Iranian culture--particularly art, architecture, literature, and their influence--we investigate the traditional myths and religions of ancient Iran, the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness, the establishment of Shi'i Islam as the state religion, and the conflict of the vision and mysticism of traditional Iranian culture with that of the West. We survey the political organization of the Empire, Alexander the Great's conquest of Iran and its aftermath, and the impact of the Arab-Islamic conquest. We examine the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness after World War II, and the transformation of the country during the Islamic Revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic StudiesSPRING 2011 V55.0549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History) syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses0751 Expressive Culture: Television Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus The Twilight Zone and Expressive Culture of the 1950s and 1960s. According to cliché, the 1950s in America were a period of conformity and consensus, but it is clear that there were many signs of discontent with and within the image of cheerful homogeneity. For example, at the end of the decade, the television program The Twilight Zone, showed everyday life as a source of paranoia in which ordinary existence revealed its frightening underside. Then, as the nation engaged with the New Frontier of the Kennedy 1960s, the show used science fiction to represent dreams as American nightmares. We look at The Twilight Zone in terms of its expressive rendition of 1950s and 1960s America. Along the way, we examine the shift in American television from East Coast production of liberal drama to West Coast production of escapism and entertainment and will situate Rod Serling's career within that shift. We also examine other renditions of paranoia (and symbolic resolutions of it) across the popular culture and politics of the moment. Most broadly, we attempt to examine the medium of popular television as an expressive cultural form which enlightened liberals like Serling tried to use as a mode of moral and aesthetic uplift. Critical methods that might help us understand the potentials of television as expressive culture are emphasized.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa\nProf. Adams (NYU in Ghana) syllabus African culture through autobiography. Texts consist of chronological life histories and memoirs, e. g., by writers of aristocratic birth and those of peasant birth, by individuals accomplished in the arts and others in the sciences, by Nobel laureates and by political leaders, by women and by men. Each narrative provides an intimate acquaintance with the traditions, aspirations, challenges, and strategies from the writer's own society. Collectively they provide the skeleton of a usefully subjective narrative of modern African history. The depicted lives include an 18th-century enslaved Nigerian child, who, ultimately, as a free man, would become a respected abolitionist; the U.S.-educated leader of Africa's first nation to gain independence from colonialism; the passionate Kenyan crusader for the preservation of Africa's environment as the source of its self-development; and the physically and morally courageous exemplar of the battle that overthrew South African apartheid.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain—At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America\nProf. Galban (NYU in Madrid) syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain—the idea of Spain—that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain's New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933–36). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multicultural France\nProf. Epstein (NYU in Paris) syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \"race,\" identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \"ethnic community\" so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \"homogeneity\" of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \"primitive\" art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, négritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague—In the Heart of Central Europe\nProf. Mucha (NYU in Prague) syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world's richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.\n\nHanhart (Mathematics) Examines the role of mathematics as the language of science through case studies selected from the natural sciences and economics\n\nTopics include the scale of things in the natural world; the art of making estimates; cross-cultural views of knowledge about the natural world; growth laws, including the growth of money and the concept of \"constant dollars\"; radioactivity and its role in unraveling the history of the earth and solar system; the notion of randomness and basic ideas from statistics; scaling laws and why things are the size they are; the cosmic distance ladder; and the meaning of \"infinity.\" This calculator-based course is designed to help you use mathematics with some confidence in applications.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0105 Quantitative Reasoning: Elementary Statistics\nProf\n\nHanhart (Mathematics) This course examines the role in mathematics in making ``correct'' probability, game theory, division strategies, and optimization.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0109 Quantitative Reasoning: Math & Computations Using Python Prof\n\nMarateck (Computer Science) This course teaches key mathematical concepts using the new Python programming language\n\nHanhart (Mathematics) syllabus Examines the role of mathematics as the language of science through case studies selected from the natural and social sciences\n\nTopics include growth laws, including the growth of money and the concept of \"constant dollars\"; radioactivity and its role in unraveling the history of the earth and solar system; the notion of randomness and basic ideas from probability and statistics; scaling principles and trigonometry and its role in determining measurements from antiquity to today\n\nSpecial attention is devoted to quantifying the notions of \"correct,'' \"fair,'' and \"best'' and using these ideas to establish optimal decisions and algorithms to problems of incomplete information and uncertain outcomes\n\nThe mathematical tools used include a selection of topics in statistics, probability, optimization, and geometric growth.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.0109 Quantitative Reasoning: Math & Computations Using Python Prof\n\nMarateck (Computer Science) syllabus This\ncourse teaches key mathematical concepts using the new Python\nprogramming language\n\nNo prior knowledge of programming is\nrequired.\n\nNatural Science I\n\nThe prerequisite for all Natural Science I courses is completion of or exemption from Quantitative Reasoning, or completion of an approved substitute course.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0203 Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment Prof\n\nHow old is the Universe? How did galaxies, stars, and planets form? What are the fundamental constituents of matter and how do they combine to form the contents of the Universe? The course will cover measurements and chains of scientific reasoning that have allowed us to reconstruct the Big Bang by measuring little wisps of light reaching the Earth, to learn about sub-atomic particles by use of many-mile long machines, and to combine the two to understand the Universe as a whole from the sub-atomic particles of which it is composed.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0214 Natural Science I: How Things Work Prof\n\nBoth these theories are explored quantitatively, together with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy which powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the birth of the universe.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0214 Natural Science I: How Things Work Prof\n\nGrierNatural Science II\n\nThe prerequisite for all Natural Science II courses is completion of or exemption from Quantitative Reasoning, or completion of an approved substitute course\n\nWe will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon\n\nThis interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science\n\nTopics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof\n\nHawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof\n\nWe then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits\n\nWhat sort of animal were we?

Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics\n\nThroughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds\n\nd'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof\n\nMusic of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof\n\nAs it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed\n\nReading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof\n\nReadings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles;

{"text": "`exponent' in Arithmetica integra (1544); correlated the terms of an arithmetic sequence with the terms of a geometric sequence; used negative exponents John Napier (Scottish, 1550 1617) began to work on the concept of logarithms about 1590; published the first description and table of logarithms in Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio (1614); invented the word `\n\n`exponents' and discussed what we would describe as \"when you multiply the numbers, you add the exponents.\" Napier was also visited by Dr. John Craig, a member of the Scottish royal court, who met had the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1590 and seen some of Tycho's work with prosthaphaeresis. This was a long-known method of using \"product to sum\" formulas: namely, such trigonometric identities as 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x y). Whatever the impetus, in 1614 Napier published the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) and then posthumously in 1619 the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio (Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) was published. It appears as if Napier wished his work to be as widely accessible as possible, and to this end he aided in Edward Wright's translation of the Descriptio into English in 1616. In this translation he explained that his intent with logarithms was to aid in the calculations involved in multiplication, division, and the taking of roots: Seeing Napier coined the word `\n\n`exponential' function, where the variable is the exponent of some positive base. Leonhard Euler, the enormously influential mathematician of the later 18th century, formulated the relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions when he defined log a b = c to be the case if and only if a c = b; therefore, y = a x was equivalent to the statement x = log a y. This was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations. It has provided a gateway into the solutions and analysis of many types of problems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to solve otherwise. An important observation therefore can be made that despite the view of many, both in the past and in present times, mathematics is indeed a changing science. A method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings. Until fairly recently, high school students versed in math and science were given a significant exposure to the computational methods which logarithms opened up and the mechanical devices which logarithms helped create. With the advent of inexpensive hand-held calculators, the computational roots of logarithms have become obsolete, yet the concepts which logarithms have led to continue to be of great utility. We need to be cautious whenever we decide a particular method or approach has reached a dead end; the history of logarithms provides an excellent example of how mathematics grows and develops new relationships for what may appear to be concepts and techniques which have been outgrown, but which can continue to provide important mathematics. It is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined. Vistas open up which are almost unimaginable until you reach the peak, and not only the path up but the ground below takes on a very different appearance. You can marvel at the difficulties of some paths and the ease of others, but it is difficult to not appreciate the sheer\n15\neffort required along any path to make it to the top, and especially for those who pioneered a particular path. So too it is with the concepts and computations of logarithms; whether it be Napier, Brgi, Briggs, or any of the multitude who followed them, we must continue to remember and appreciate their contributions and exertions. Questions: 1. In Proposition 5 of the Constructio Napier writes \"In numbers distinguished thus by a period in their midst, whatever is written after the period is a fraction, the denominator of which is unity with as many cyphers after it as there are figures after the period.\" (Napier, p. 8) What exactly does this appear to refer to? 2. In Proposition 52 Napier states \"All sines in the proportion of ten to one will have 23025842.34 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) What exactly is Napier saying in modern terms? 3. In an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes \"Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c. [or division by 2, 3, & c.].\" (Napier, p. 51) Translate the meaning of this statement into more modern terms. 4. In 1617, Napier published the Rabdologi where he described the construction and use of what are now called `\n\n`3' indicates is of three. Also a2 is said to be the square, a3 the cube, a4 the square-square (fourth power), a5 the square-cube (fifth power), a6 the cube-cube (sixth power), a7 the square-square-cube (seventh power) and so forth. Exercises 1. Explain what \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means. 2. Is the explanation Sir Isaac Newton gave his students in the following enough for you to write terms using exponents? Give your reasons why or why not. Would you be able to evaluate a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3? \"Thus.\" 3. According to Newton what does the `\n\n`S' shape is highly suggestive of the model of logistic growth. If your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y = . Again, map this function 1 + (12224 10 50 )e ( -.060438 x ) . over the data set, and observe the fit. To get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it. Notice how the curve flattens out. What is the implication of such a graph? Now, let's consider the full range of data through the 1990 census. Include in your data the following: Year Population 1960 7,781,984 1970 7,894,862 1980 7,071,639 1990 7,322,564\nThe graph of the full set of data is in Chart 4; make sure your graph is similar. Note the strong fit of the curve through the data of 1950, and then how the curve fails to model the data, particularly in 1980 and 1990. Some conclusions: The first matter for us to consider here is the history of some of these models. The simplest concept of growth is one that results in an arithmetic pattern; early scientific consideration of population growth of crops and domesticated animals demonstrated this model was not sufficient to explain the observed growth. Thomas Malthus (1766 1834) was an English clergyman and political economist who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. In there, he wrote that \"population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio.\" When this idea was investigated mathematically, it resulted in the exponential model expressed above. Pierre Francois Verhulst (1804 1849) was a Belgian mathematician and statistician who is credited with first writing about the logistic model of growth in 1845, when he attempted to take into account factors, such as limited resources, that would also tend to slow down growth after time. (Our logistic equation is written in the form y = f(t); Verhulst wrote it in the form t = h(y). This form requires the use of logarithms, and apparently he coined the word `\n\nExponentials Logarithms\nDawn Leigh Anderson University of Georgia Athens, Georgia Ann Willis Sebrell Godwin High School Richmond, Virginia Rebecca Berg Bowie State University Bowie, Maryland Donald W.

In light of this guidance, the study of Logarithmic and Exponential functions plays a very important role in secondary education, particularly in providing a way to model some of the real world problems that students meet outside of the classroom. Such problems are found in diverse places as medicine and finance, as well as, advanced mathematics and politics. More likely than not, if one asked those who studied mathematics in secondary school 25 years ago why they studied exponentials and logarithms, other than to learn about slide rule computation, many would say it was because the topic was a chapter in their textbook that had to be covered. One wonders why something that made a major impact on mathematics four centuries ago became so meaningless to the secondary students of the latter half of the 20th century, the \"new math\" era. Fortunately, textbooks which embody the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics today reward the student with the theory of exponents and logarithms along with the study of contemporary applications giving meaning to the study. In 1989, the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, which The Principles and Standards for School Mathematics were designed to build upon, were released. The document encouraged that attention be focused \"on the need for student awareness of the interaction between mathematics and the historical situations from which it has developed and the impact that interaction has on or culture and our lives\" (p.6). There is no doubt that the study of the history of exponents and logarithms is a prime example of how \"theoretical mathematics (which) has burgeoned in its diversity and deepened in its complexity and abstraction...has become more ... vital to our technologically oriented society\" (p.6). Goals of the Module: 1. To understand the historical background leading to the development of exponents, exponentials, and logarithms and to see how mathematical concepts evolve over periods of time. 2. To provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge of exponents and logarithms to various concrete situations and problems in a historical context. 3. To show students the connection between exponential functions and logarithmic functions, that is the inverse relationship they share with one another. 4. To develop in students an appreciation of the history connected with the development of exponents and logarithms.\n4\nHow to use this module: The authors realize this module contains more material than most teachers can squeeze into an already overcrowded syllabus. It is recommended that the teacher review the material and pick and choose those topics that best fit teacher and students' needs. The material can be made to fit many different types of objectives, and it can be made to fit many different lesson plans. It may even be of interest to teachers of subjects other than mathematics. General historical material may be used for group or whole class discussion. Some quotations and biographical sketches may be more appropriate for introductory material while some are best used within activities. Students should be able to locate the places mentioned on a world map. The written assignments that are required in some of the activities could also include connections with units in social studies, science, economics, etc. If more comprehensive studies are required or desired, the authors have included a bibliography for students and teachers interested in the further study of content in the module. Time Schedule Time needed will depend on the activities and materials the individual teacher chooses to use and the level of the class. The activities may be used to introduce the topic and then further work may be accomplished using exercises found in student textbooks. The teacher is in no way obliged to ask students to perform all these activities; one is not constrained to follow the suggested sequence in which the activities are listed nor to follow the teacher hints. The authors believe that the history will enable students to understand the mathematics better. It is further suggested that the mathematics teacher team teach parts of this module with a history or social science teacher, if such an arrangement can be made. Materials Needed It is highly recommended that the teacher post a world map. Other materials which may be needed in these activities are: machine tape, straightedge, compass, ruler, lined paper, graphing paper, graphing calculator or graphing utility, computers. .Classroom Organization: When using the exploratory activities and projects of this module appears to be the appropriate time to have the class organized into cooperative groups. Using a constructivist approach, the lessons have been created with questions or hints that are designed to guide the student toward \"discovering\" the relevant results. The quotations of mathematicians may be best presented to the class as a whole on overhead transparencies; copies may be made for personal study by the students.\n5\nSuggested Courses for Using Module Activities\nActivity Exponent Notation According to Newton Properties of Exponential Functions Properties of Exponents Compound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase What Will Happen If....?

Lord Moulton, The Invention of Logarithms, Its Genesis and Growth (NTV, 21) The discovery of logarithms is attributed to the Scottish mathematician John Napier; in this section, you will be able to learn about Napier's life, how he formulated the first view of logarithms, and how they were quickly transformed during his own lifetime into something different. The temptation is severe to recast all of Napier's work through the lens of our present interpretation of logarithms, but the actual story is every bit as impressive. Moulton's quote above is useful to keep in mind when we consider the path which Napier took. John Napier was born into an influential and well-to-do family in 1550 in the family estate at Murchiston Castle near Edinburgh, Scotland as the eldest son of Archibald and Janet Napier. Before his death (also at Murchiston) in 1617, he was to become a theologian and an ardent supporter of the Protestant faith, an inventor of weaponry, and an exceptional mathematician. In mathematics, he was known for his work on spherical trigonometry, his invention of an early form of a mechanical calculator, and in particular, his discovery of and work with logarithms. It is also the case that Napier's name was spelled a variety of different ways, including by himself, among them being: Napeir, Nepeir, Neper, Nepper, Naper, Napare, and Naipper. We will adopt the spelling in ordinary usage at the present time. We really know quite little about Napier's early life. It seems he was a student at University of St. Andrews, but he never earned a degree there. He may have traveled abroad, but by 1571 he had returned to the family estates in Scotland where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Stirling in 1572, and after she died in 1579, he married Agnes Chisholm. He had a son and a daughter by his first wife and five sons and five daughters by his second. At this time in Scotland, religious strive was rampant. King James VI of Scotland had designs on the English throne, and there were rumors of the involvement of King Philip II of Spain in those plans. The issue of whether Scotland would become Catholic or Protestant became a widespread concern, and Napier came down very firmly on the side of the Protestants. Scotland suffered through a civil war in 1570-72, and in 1588 the English defeated the Spanish Armada. In 1593 Napier wrote the Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John; to gain a sense of this book, consider the following quote from a letter addressed to King James which formed the dedication: \"...let it be your Majesty's continuall study...to reforme the universall enormities of your country, and first...to begin at your Majesty's owne house, familie and court, and purge the same of all suspicion of Papists and Atheists and Newtralls...\" (NTV, 42) The book was widely read; between 1593 and 1645 there were 5 English editions, 2 Dutch editions, 5 French editions, and 3 in German. In it, among other things, Napier declared the Pope to be the Antichrist and predicted \"that the day of God's judgement appears to fall betwixt the years of Christ 1688 and 1700.\"\n10\nThere is strong evidence that probably as early as 1594, Napier had begun to investigate certain properties of calculations which would make working with the trigonometric values of sines considerably easier to do in order to facilitate the computations involved in astronomy. The German mathematician Michael Stifel wrote the Arithmetica integra in 1544, and it contained a clear statement relating the arithmetic sequence of integers (1, 2, 3...) with the corresponding geometric sequence of 2 raised to those powers ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 , ...), and this may have suggested the possibility to Napier of using sums to compute products. Stifel even called the powers `exponents' and discussed what we would describe as \"when you multiply the numbers, you add the exponents.\" Napier was also visited by Dr. John Craig, a member of the Scottish royal court, who met had the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1590 and seen some of Tycho's work with prosthaphaeresis. This was a long-known method of using \"product to sum\" formulas: namely, such trigonometric identities as 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x y). Whatever the impetus, in 1614 Napier published the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) and then posthumously in 1619 the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio (Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) was published. It appears as if Napier wished his work to be as widely accessible as possible, and to this end he aided in Edward Wright's translation of the Descriptio into English in 1616. In this translation he explained that his intent with logarithms was to aid in the calculations involved in multiplication, division, and the taking of roots: Seeing Napier coined the word `logarithm' from the Greek words logos (ratio) and arithmos (number), and his original definition takes some getting used to, compared to our present interpretation of a logarithm. Keep in mind as well that he originally was working strictly with the sines of angles. In proposition 26 in the Constructio he states: \"The logarithm of a given sine is that number which has increased arithmetically with the same velocity throughout as that with which radius began to decrease geometrically, and in the same time as radius has decreased to the given sine.\" (Napier, p. 19) T b g a S i\nIn the figure above, imagine that TS is a line segment of 10 7 units, and that bi is a ray from b. (Napier chose 10 7 for his radius so that he could use values of sines accurate to 7 decimal places but treat them as integers. It is also the case that Napier was one of the first mathematicians to widely use the decimal point as we now write it to separate the integer from the decimal fractional part of a number.) A point g starts at T and moves towards S at a rate\n11\nequal to its distance from S; at the same time that g starts at T, point a starts at b and moves towards i at the same rate as g's initial velocity. The distance from b to a is then the logarithm of the length from g to S. There are some immediate conclusions that can be reached, stressing the difference from this original view of logarithms and our present perspective. Let Nap. log stand for Napier's definition. First, if g is still at T, then the point a is still at b; therefore, Nap. log 10 7 = 0 and Nap. log is a decreasing function. Second, it can be shown that Nap. log (xy) = Nap. log x + Nap. log y Nap. log 1. Recasting Napier's description in the language of differential equations and x solving, it is possible to demonstrate that Nap. log x = 10 7 log 1 7 ; however, it is critical to 10\ne\nstress that Napier did not interpret his logarithms in anything approaching the modern sense of an exponent for some given base. It may be reassuring to us to solve a differential equation to obtain something more familiar, but Napier's vision clearly did not start there. From the top of the mountain, we can see that Napier's path and our more recent path of regarding logarithms as exponents clearly both get us to the top, but the paths themselves are very, very different. Napier regarded one of the essential properties of logarithms as \"the logarithms of similarly proportioned sines are equidifferent.\" (Napier, p. 23) In other words, for a given k, log (kx) log x = log (ky) log y. This can clearly be considered, in light of the laws of logarithms ky kx which Napier himself knew, as equivalent to log = log . In another interesting side x y note, Napier's proposition 51 states: \"All sines in the proportion of two to one have 6931469.22 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) This statement is closely related to the fact that the natural logarithm of 2 is .693147180. Henry Briggs (1561 1630) was an English mathematician and professor of geometry at Gresham House, London at the time he met Napier; he went on to become the first Savilian professor of geometry at Merton College, Oxford. After having read the Descriptio, he went to Edinburgh in 1615 to meet with Napier. It is somewhat unusual in scientific history, but the two men immediately hit it off and in fact worked with each other until Napier's death in 1617. In 1617 with the publication of Logarithmorum chilias prima and in 1624 with Arithmetica logarithmica Briggs implemented the changes in Napier's logarithmic scheme that he and Napier had considered. Quoting from the preface to the Arithmetica logarithmica: That these logarithms differ from those which that illustrious man, the Baron of Merchiston, must not surprise you...concerning that matter I wrote immediately to the author himself...I journeyed to Edinburgh, where, being most hospitably received by him, I lingered for a whole month. But as we talked over the change in the logarithms he said that he had for some time been of the same opinion and had wished to accomplish it; he had however published those he had already prepared until he could construct more convenient ones if his affairs and his health would admit of it. But he was of the opinion that the change should be effected in this manner, that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and 10000000000\n12\nthat of the whole sine; which I could not but admit was by far the most convenient. (NTV, p. 126) It seems clear that Napier had already begun to consider a more accessible approach to his logarithms, and that Briggs' suggestions helped moved him in that direction. (As Napier himself observed at the end of his table of logarithms in the Constructio: \"Nothing is perfect at birth.\" (Napier, p. 87.)) Since the logarithm of 1 becomes 0, this simplifies greatly the computational algorithms that Napier had already discovered, bringing them in line with our present theorems of logarithms. In the Constructio, an appendix was included \"On the Construction of another and better kind of Logarithms, namely one in which the Logarithm of unity is 0.\" In this, Napier suggested but in fact did not do a revision of his own system, reflecting what he and Briggs had already determined would make computations with logarithms easier. Napier also observed in the Constructio that in this case, \"if two numbers with known Logarithms be multiplied together, forming a third; the sum of their Logarithms will be the Logarithm of the third\" (Napier, p. 50) (in other words, when you multiply, you add) and went on to state all the other familiar laws of logarithms which we use. He went ahead and then observed \"whence the only difficulty is in finding the Logarithms of the prime numbers\" (Napier, p. 51). Briggs went ahead with his own work after Napier's death, and the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica contain what is for all intents and purposes the first table of common logarithms i.e., base 10 logarithms. One of the sections of this module discussed how to calculate logarithms somewhat in the method of Napier and Briggs. However, to get a sense of what they went through, consider the following. In constructing his tables, Napier started with the value of his radius 10,000,000 and began successive multiplications of that by 1-10 -7 ; in more modern terms, he generated the terms of a geometric sequence whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -7 . Moulton argues that in performing this process some 100 times, Napier became aware that decreasing a number by the same ratio each time was equivalent to repeatedly decreasing a line segment by the same proportional length, possibly giving rise to Napier's definition of a logarithm. It may have also been the case that through the sheer effort of this work, Napier eventually saw the utility of having (in modern terms) log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 1, but that he needed to go through the tremendous labor of the first construction to reach that conclusion. It is therefore tempting now to claim Napier must have therefore seen that he was constructing a system where the logarithm corresponded to the necessary power of 10 needed to obtain the given number, but that again is our view from the mountain, not Napier's. After working through the first 100 terms (his first table), Napier apparently became aware of the tremendous work left, so he changed to a geometric series whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -5 . He carried this out for 50 more terms, giving a second table. He then created two other series in a third table, one having ratio 1- 1/2000 and one having ratio 1 - 1/100. Using the data he had accumulated with his three tables, he was then able to calculate the logarithm values of numbers from 10 7 to almost exactly 5 x 10 6 . It is small wonder that Napier worked on his tables for 20 years before he published them! In the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs approached the problem differently. He began with log 10 = 1 and then began taking successive square roots, using well-known algorithms for the computations needed for the roots. (For\n13\nexample, if 10 = 3.162277, then log 3.162277 = .5.) Once Briggs obtained the logarithms of the primes, it was easy, using the laws of logarithms, to then generate the values of the logarithms of composite numbers. It may be somewhat astonishing to realize the work required by Briggs to obtain, in Arithmetica logarithmica, the logarithms of all natural numbers from 1 to 20,000 and 90,000 to 100,000, carried out to 14 places. (For example, in his calculations to obtain the logarithm of 2 he took 47 successive square roots.) Adriaan Vlacq a few years later completed Briggs' work and completed a table for all integers from 1 to 100,000 to 10 decimals places. (Until recently, these tables formed the basis of all modern logarithm tables.) Napier also used his idea to construct what were called \"Napier's bones\", a mechanical multiplication table. Within 7 years, William Oughtred used Napier's ideas to construct the first rectilinear slide rules, basically the first pocket calculator. Some two hundred years after Napier's publication, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace noted that \"by shortening the labors, (Napier) doubled the life of the astronomer.\" Logarithms also present one of the instances when a given discovery must have been in the air; it now seems clear that roughly at the same time Napier was working on his own logarithms, the same essential concept occurred to the Swiss astronomer and watchmaker Joost Brgi (1552 - 1632). While the exact timing of Brgi's work is not entirely clear, he may have in fact worked on the concept before Napier did; however, it is the case that he did not publish his own tables (actually, his were tables of anti-logarithms) until 1620 in Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen. Kepler's statement on the priority issue may be of some interest: \"...(this) led the way for Justus Byrgius to the very same logarithms many years before Napier's edition, although this man, a procrastinator and guardian of his secrets, abandoned his child at birth and did not rear it for publicity.\" (Goldstine, p. 22) Brgi generated the values in his own table by starting with 10 8 and then multiplying by 1 + 10 -4 to obtain the successive terms. The ease with which the discovery of logarithms supported the massive calculations needed for astronomy and navigation generated intense interest among mathematicians. The work of Gregory of St. Vincent and his student A. A. de Sarasa by 1647 made the connection between the natural logarithm of a number a and the area bounded by the x-axis, the vertical a 1 lines x = 1 and x = a (for any a > 0) and the curve y = 1/x, what we would now call dx . x 1 (Natural logarithms are contrasted with common, or Briggsian logarithms by their base. If we use Euler's interpretation of a logarithm as the exponent of a given base, then natural logarithms use the number e = 2.718281828... as their base, while common logarithms use 10.) The Danish mathematician Nicolaus Mercator is usually credited with discovering the formula for the x2 x3 x4 expansion of the natural logarithm of x + 1 as the power series x - + - +... by 1668. 2 3 4 As early as 1664 Newton used this same idea to compute the value of the natural logarithm of 1.1 to 68 decimal places. The ground-breaking work of Newton and Leibniz in the calculus quickly suggested applications of logarithms very far indeed from Napier's original view of the technique.\n14\nIt turned out that the method that was developed to help with computational drudgery held a vital key in the new mathematics of calculus. The logarithm took on a life of its own, separate from the astonishing levels of sheer, brute arithmetic that it both replaced and which were required to establish the first logarithm tables. The logarithm continued to play a major role in computational sciences, but it had already begun to move away from its roots. As the 18th century progressed, mathematicians became increasingly aware of the necessary changes which calculus had brought to the techniques available to them, and also to the changes which were needed in their more basic structures in order to give the methods of calculus a concrete logical base. One of the more central concepts which evolved was that of a `function', namely the ability to regard an operation as the pairing of the number which was to be operated on with the number which resulted from the operation itself. In more abstract terms, it allowed mathematicians to regard the operation as an object itself, more divorced from the immediate numerical relationships. For example, while mathematicians had worked with the numerical relationships expressed in 2 2 = 4, 2 3 = 8, and so forth, they could now consider the relationship between the variables x and y in y = 2 x . This is an example of an `exponential' function, where the variable is the exponent of some positive base. Leonhard Euler, the enormously influential mathematician of the later 18th century, formulated the relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions when he defined log a b = c to be the case if and only if a c = b; therefore, y = a x was equivalent to the statement x = log a y. This was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations. It has provided a gateway into the solutions and analysis of many types of problems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to solve otherwise. An important observation therefore can be made that despite the view of many, both in the past and in present times, mathematics is indeed a changing science. A method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings. Until fairly recently, high school students versed in math and science were given a significant exposure to the computational methods which logarithms opened up and the mechanical devices which logarithms helped create. With the advent of inexpensive hand-held calculators, the computational roots of logarithms have become obsolete, yet the concepts which logarithms have led to continue to be of great utility. We need to be cautious whenever we decide a particular method or approach has reached a dead end; the history of logarithms provides an excellent example of how mathematics grows and develops new relationships for what may appear to be concepts and techniques which have been outgrown, but which can continue to provide important mathematics. It is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined. Vistas open up which are almost unimaginable until you reach the peak, and not only the path up but the ground below takes on a very different appearance. You can marvel at the difficulties of some paths and the ease of others, but it is difficult to not appreciate the sheer\n15\neffort required along any path to make it to the top, and especially for those who pioneered a particular path. So too it is with the concepts and computations of logarithms; whether it be Napier, Brgi, Briggs, or any of the multitude who followed them, we must continue to remember and appreciate their contributions and exertions. Questions: 1. In Proposition 5 of the Constructio Napier writes \"In numbers distinguished thus by a period in their midst, whatever is written after the period is a fraction, the denominator of which is unity with as many cyphers after it as there are figures after the period.\" (Napier, p. 8) What exactly does this appear to refer to? 2. In Proposition 52 Napier states \"All sines in the proportion of ten to one will have 23025842.34 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) What exactly is Napier saying in modern terms? 3. In an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes \"Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c. [or division by 2, 3, & c.].\" (Napier, p. 51) Translate the meaning of this statement into more modern terms. 4. In 1617, Napier published the Rabdologi where he described the construction and use of what are now called `Napier's bones' or `Napier's rods'. Find out what these were and what they were used for.\n16\nJohn Napier\n17\nLesez Euler, lesez Euler, c'est notre maitre a tous. Read Euler, read Euler!

True, he was very busy and so refused flatly to give me private lessons; but he gave me much more valuable advice to start reading more difficult mathematical books on my own and to study them as diligently as I could; if I cam across some obstacle of difficulty, I was given permission to visit him freely every Saturday afternoon and he kindly explained to me everything I could not understand, which happened with such greatly desired advantage that whenever he had obviated one difficulty for me, because of that ten others disappeared right away, and this undoubtedly, is the best method to succeed in mathematical subjects.

The students may work in groups or individually. If the students need extra time to finish the problems, they could be assigned as homework. It is interesting to read the way that Newton introduced exponents and the terminology that he used. It is also interesting to note that this was part of a lecture Newton gave at Cambridge University - so your students are being exposed to the type of mathematics that was available to university students in the 1680's. An additional assignment would be to have the students write the complete passage in the background information using modern terminology.

If a is a quantity, \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means a a. There will be various answers to this. Hopefully most will find it sufficient. The solution to a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3 a2b4 = 42 x 34 = 4 4 3 3 x 3 3 = 1296 It means that the a is to multiplied together 3 times: a a a It means a a a. Since he is naming the powers, like a5 as cube-square, he is adding the powers. So a8 would be square-cube-cube or maybe square-square-square-square.\n3. 4. 5.\n24\nExponent Notation According to Newton Student Page\nHistorical Background In Sir Isaac Newton's widely read Arithmetica Universalis, many beginning algebraic topics are included. One such topic is that of exponents. This activity comes directly from one of Newton's Arithmetica Universalis, which is a collection of the material covered in his lectures at Cambridge University in England in the 1680's. The following excerpts are from the 1972 translation by D. T. Whiteside from Newton's original Latin. t From page 61: If a quantity should multiply itself, for shortness the number of factors is usually appended. Thus. Here note that a number written immediately between two variables relates always to the preceding one. Thus `3' in the quantity a3b2does not signify the b2 is to be taken 3 times, but denotes that a has twice to be multiplied into itself. Note also that these quantities are said to be of as many dimensions, powers or `dignities' as they comprise factors or quantities multiplying one another, and that the number appended is called the index of their power or dimension. Thus a2 is of two dimensions or powers, while a3, as its appended number `3' indicates is of three. Also a2 is said to be the square, a3 the cube, a4 the square-square (fourth power), a5 the square-cube (fifth power), a6 the cube-cube (sixth power), a7 the square-square-cube (seventh power) and so forth. Exercises 1. Explain what \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means. 2. Is the explanation Sir Isaac Newton gave his students in the following enough for you to write terms using exponents? Give your reasons why or why not. Would you be able to evaluate a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3? \"Thus.\" 3. According to Newton what does the `3' in the expression a3b2 mean? 4. What does the phrase \"a has twice to be multiplied into itself\" mean? 5. Using Newton's method of naming powers, how would he describe the eighth power of a, a8?\n25\nProperties of Exponential Functions Teacher Notes\nThis activity is a great way to give students the opportunity to graph and observe a variety of exponential functions and then summarize their findings.

Answers will vary, but will be similar to the ones in A through C above. Students might choose negative or zero values for a. If they do, this is a good time to discuss why these values give very strange graphs, graphs which we will usually avoid. In general, in precalculus and calculus classes we generally want to talk just about continuous functions and functions whose inverses are also functions. E. Answers will vary, but will include some of the following observations. All the graphs intersect at the point (0,1). None of the graphs has negative y-values. If a > 0, as z increases, y increases. As a gets larger, the values of y increase faster as z increases. If a < 1, as z increases, y decreases. If a = 1, then y = 1; i.e. the function is constant. If a < 0, the graph jumps back and forth between positive and negative values for y as z increases. F. Answers will vary. Many students will find that their answers include some, if not all, of Euler's observations.\n28\nProperties of Exponential Functions Student Pages\nLeonhard Euler wrote the first easy-to-read precalculus book in 1748. First, see how you might figure out properties of exponential functions; then compare your summary to his. Look at a general exponential function, y = a z , and see what happens to the graph as the value of a changes. Use the same scale for all graphs.

Compare what you have written with the description Euler writes concisely below.\n30\nEuler gives a magnificent and clear description of an exponential function in his precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite (1748). The values of the exponential a z depend primarily on the magnitude of the constant a . If a = 1 , then we always have a z = 1 , no matter what value is given z to z . If a > 1 , then a will have a greater value if the value of z is greater than it was originally and as z goes to infinity, so also a z increases to infinity. If z = 0 , then a z = 1 ; if z < 0 , then the values of a z become less than 1 and as z goes to z - , a goes to 0. On the other hand if a < 1 but still positive, then the values of a z decrease when z increases above 0. The exponential [ a z ] increases as z 1 increases in the negative direction. Since when a < 1 , we have < 1 , and if we a 1 -z z let = b , then a = b . For this reason we can examine the case when a < 1 a from the case when a > 1 .\n31\nProperties of Exponents Teacher Notes\nThis activity gives students the opportunity to look at how a master mathematician expressed several ideas about exponents in his great precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite, published in 1748.

It tells how to multiply numbers with the same base, in this case 2, by adding their denominations (meaning our exponents). 8f. Chuquet's secret is the same as our answer to 8e.\n33\nProperties of Exponents Student Pages\nWhat would happen if exponents were numbers other than natural numbers? Islamic mathematicians of the 11th century were the earliest people to use negative numbers as exponents. Nicole Oresme, a French mathematician associated with the University of Paris around 1350, had some ideas about fractional exponents and even tried to explain what it would mean to have an irrational number as an exponent. In 1655, John Wallis, an English mathematician, gave a clearer explanation of fractional exponents and a few years later, Isaac Newton was able to make use of them with ease. Here, however, we look at the explanation of exponents of various types by the prolific mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748: Let the exponential to be considered be a where a is a constant and the exponent z is a variable. Since the exponent z stands for all determined numbers, it is clear at least that all positive integers can be substituted for z to give determined 1 2 3 4 5 6 values for a , a , a , a , a , a , etc. If for z we substitute the negative integers -1, -2, -3, etc. we obtain\nz\n1 1 1 1 1 1 , , , , , , etc. If z = 0, a1 a2 a 3 a4 a5 a6 then we have a0 = 1. If we substitute a fraction for z , for instance 1 1 2 1 3 , , , , , etc., we obtain 2 3 3 4 4\nthe values more values, since the extraction of roots gives several values. However, we will consider only their primary [now called principal] values, since\n1 2 1 3 a, a 3 , a 3 , a 4 , a 4 , etc. These symbols can have two or\na a and 3 a ... In like manner we let z take irrational values, even though it is more 7 difficult to understand this concept. ... Thus a has a value which lies between 2 3 a and a ...\nfrom Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite by Leonhard Euler Some statements in that selection probably look more familiar than other statements. For example, in the first sentence Euler talks about negative exponents. In the second sentence he\n1 tells about square roots so that we understand a 2\nz\n5 2 lies between is to be thought of as a ... function. For this reason. a\n2\n= a\n1 and by implication, a 3\n= 3 a , etc.\nWe can use this to help us rewrite expressions with rational exponents as expressions with radicals instead. Complete the following using Euler's idea to rewrite the expressions using radicals.\n34\n2 1 1 2 3 = a 3 = a 2 3 = _________________ 1. a\n( )\n1 2. a 4\n= _________________\n3 3. a 4 =__________________= __________________=__________________\nThe sixth and seventh sentences refer to situations such as the fact that a given positive number has two different square roots, a positive one and a negative one. But since we want to define an exponential function, we will consider only the positive value.\n5 lies between the two 2 7 successive integers 2 and 3. Finally, Euler also suggest that one can estimate the value of a when one knows that 7 lies between the two successive integers 2 and 3.\nUse this method to estimate the following by stating the numbers between which the given number lies. Example. 4\n5 2 3 2 = _______________________________________________________________ 4. 4 2 3 = a number between 4 and 4 , that is, between 16 and 64.\n5 2 , since The next sentence suggests a method to estimate the value of a\n5. 2 6. 32\n5\n= ______________________________________________________________\n4 5 = ______________________________________________________________\n3 7. 9 2 = ________________________________________________________________\nClearly this last observation by Euler does not give very precise estimates, but it is insightful!\n8. Familiar, Yet Different, Yet Related. You are a mathematics historian; you even consider yourself a detective of sorts! As you read the selection below, think about these questions: What familiar concept is being discussed? The notation looks familiar, but wait, does it have the same meaning? Or is it a little different?\n35\nNicolas Chuquet, a mathematician who taught in Lyons, France, wrote these words sometime during the fifteenth century. He invented the notation, but its meaning has evolved somewhat since then. To understand the reason why denomination of number is added to denomination, ..., it is necessary to set down several proportional numbers beginning with 1 and arranged in a continuous sequence, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. or 3, 9, 27, etc. Numbers 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 Denomination 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nNow it is necessary to know that 1 represents and is in the place of numbers, whose denomination is 0, 2 represents [...] the first terms, whose denomination is 1. 4 holds the place of the second terms, whose denomination is 2. And 8 is in the place of the third terms, 16 holds the place of the fourth terms, 32 represents the fifth terms, and so for the others. Now whoever multiplies 1 by 1, it comes to 1, and because 1 multiplied by 1 does not change at all, neither does any other number when it is multiplied by 1 increase or diminish, and for this consideration, whoever multiplies a number by a number, it comes to a number, whose denomination is 0. And whoever adds 0 to 0 makes 0. Afterwards, whoever multiplies 2, which is the first number by 1, which is a number, the multiplication comes to 2; then afterwards, whoever adds their denominations, which are 0 and 1, it makes 1; thus the multiplication comes to 21. And from this it comes that when one multiplies numbers by first terms or vice versa, it comes to first terms. Also whoever multiplies 21 by 21, it comes to 4 which is a second number. Thus the multiplication amounts to 42. For 2 multiplied by 2 makes 4 when adding the\n36\ndenominations, that is 1 with 1, makes 2. And from this it comes that whoever multiplies first terms by first terms, it comes to second terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 21 by 42, it comes to 83. For 2 multiplied by 4 and 1 added with 2 makes 83. And thus whoever multiplies first terms by second terms, it comes to third terms. Also, whoever multiplies 42 by 42, it comes to 16 which is a fourth number, and for this reason whoever multiplies second terms by second terms, it comes to fourth terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 4 which is a second number by 8 which is a third number makes 32 which is a fifth number. And thus whoever multiplies second terms by third terms or vice versa, it comes to fifth terms. And third terms by fourth terms comes to 7th terms, and fourth terms by fourth terms, it comes to 8th terms, and so for the others. In this discussion there is manifest a secret which is in the proportional numbers. It is that whoever multiplies a proportional number by itself, it comes to the number of the double of its denomination, as, whoever multiplies 8 which is a third number by itself, it comes to 64 which is a sixth. And 16 which is a fourth number multiplied by itself should come to 256, which is an eighth. And whoever multiplies 128 which is the 7th proportional by 512 which is the 9th, it should come to 65536 which is the 16th. from N. Chuquet, pp. 144, 151-153 a.

Compound interest holds much promise for applying mathematical ideas to relatively important everyday applications, such as the amount of money an investor makes on a particular investment, a notion Americans are familiar with living in a capitalist society. The need to understand compound interest also arises in calculating the interest that accrues on credit card purchases, car, home, and boat loans, and financial investments. In the following activity, a historical example is used as a springboard to discuss compound interest. The historical context is centered on the European colonist's purchase of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Exposure to the compound interest formula is a prerequisite.) Objective: To investigate an application of exponential growth, compound interest, using an situation taken from the historical context of the Dutch \"purchase\" of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Materials: Student Page; Calculator; Graphing calculator and Internet access (optional) Time Frame: Two 45-minute class periods; extended project would be done outside of class How to Use: To begin the discussion of exponential growth and compound interest embedded in a historical context, provide students with the historical opener on an overhead transparency (see Transparency #1). Have students read and reflect on this historical situation. You might ask students to develop their own questions that arise from the historical situation presented. Be prepared to consider social and historical questions as well as mathematical related questions. A second option would be to use the guiding questions in the student activity to develop the lesson. One way to begin the lesson is to look at question 1 involving compound interest. First, it might be helpful to review the general compound interest formula. You might also show students the derivation for the general compound interest formula. It might be helpful to derive the compound interest formula using an example first. Then show the students the formal algebraic derivation for the compound interest formula. Consider the following example involving compound interest. You have $100. You want to invest your money in a fund that guarantees 8% interest compounded quarterly over six years.

Guide the students through the derivation using the above given information. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is 0.08 S1 = 100 + 100 = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is 0.08 2 S 2 = S1 + S1 = S1 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02)(1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the third compounding period is 0.08 2 3 S3 = S 2 + S2 = S 2 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 Explain to your students that we are looking for S 24 ; that is, the total amount of money we have accumulated at the end of the 24th period. Next guide students to the algebraic derivation of the general compound interest. We have the following given information: r = annual interest rate t = time in years n = number of compounding periods per year nt = total number of compounding periods P = principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods r = interest rate per compounding period n nt = total number of compounding periods. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is r r S 1 = P + P = P 1 + n n\n39\nThe total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is r r r r r r r S 2 = S1 + S1 = P1 + + P1 + = P1 + 1 + = P1 + . n n n n n n n The total amount of money we have at the end of the nt -th compounding period is S nt = P1 + r . n\nnt 2\nUsing the derivation of the general compound interest formula, lead students to the exponential equation that describes the situation described in the historical opener. Let P = 24, r = 7%, n = 1 (compounded annually) and t = 372 (the number of years since 1626 this is being calculated for the year 1998) r y = S nt = P1 + n 0.07 y = 241 + 1\nnt\n(1)( 372 )\ny = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410\nGuide your students to discover that the initial formula for y represents an exponential growth function of the form, f ( x) = ab x where a is the initial amount of money, b is the growth factor, and x is the total number of compounding periods. Stress that because b > 1 in compound interest problems, then the function is an example of exponential growth. Guide students to change a and b in f(x) = abx to see the effect on the curve. Encourage students to examine the function for a > 0, a < 0, b >1, and 0 < b < 1 and to write a complete explanation of the results they found. Have students solve additional examples of exponential growth problems either using variations on the historical opener problem or problems from a textbook. Give students an opportunity to create their own problems and to explain them to the class.\n40\nCompound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase Solutions\n1. As indicated above, y = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410 2. The 3.8 billion dollars is less than the amount found in number 1, so perhaps, Minuit paid too much, or the interest rate is too high, or the tax assessment value is too low. 3. Minuit should have paid a great deal more. Land in the Old World was dear and certainly, an equivalent amount of land, in say Holland or England, would have been very expensive. But given that the amount found in number 1 is higher than the tax valuation in number 2, find a payment that would give the tax valuation. This time solve for the initial amount given that the final amount is 3.8 billion dollars and the interest rate is 7% with 372 years (this solution is being done in 1998) with annual compounding yields: 3.8 10 = a(1.07)\n9 372\n3.8 10 9 a= .044567 or about 4.5cents.

This famous mathematics book was written by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in the middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that this problem appears in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum shows that issues of population growth were of concern to the people living in the eighteenth century. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. However, this activity is designed to solve the problem using exponential functions first. Later, when logarithms and logarithmic functions are developed in the module, you can show students how to solve this problem using logarithms. Showing students how to solve this problem using both exponential and logarithmic functions provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the inherent connection between exponential and logarithmic functions.

It helps explain why a mathematical model may need to change with the passing decades. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry (Prerequisites: Using various regression equations on a graphing utility to describe data) Objective: To study various regression equations culminating in the need for the logistic equation to model real-world data Materials: Overhead projector; transparency made from the Population Data; Graphing calculators with regression equation capabilities, including the logistic function Time Frame: One class period How to Use: This activity works very well as a teacher-guided discussion with the everexpanding data set being modeled by successive functions. It helps the students see that as more and more data is available a model may need to change in order to make better predictions. 1. Perhaps begin by asking students which statistics about New York City might be valuable and why. Lead them to realize that population trends might prove useful in city planning in such areas as number and size of schools, sewage treatment and garbage collection, road construction and maintenance. 2. Using the historical information in the lesson discuss past efforts in history to solve similar prediction problems. 3. Ask students to look at the initial data set and imagine that they are city planners for NYC after the 1820 census and that they need to predict the population for the next few decades. Have them enter the data into lists on their calculators or computers, make a scatterplot of the data and fit an appropriate regression function to the data. Then have them predict the population for the next decade. 4. Ask students to pretend that a couple decades have passed and ask if their prediction was good for 1840. Now have them add this data to their previous lists, make another scatterplot incorporating all the data from 1790 through 1880, choose an appropriate regression function and predict the population for the next decade. Some students may try a quadratic regression function. It actually appears to fit the data better than the exponential function. You may want to tell them that fitting the data is not the only criterion for choosing a particular regression equation. For example, the quadratic function would imply that at first the population of NYC would decrease during the first decade under consideration. While that is\n54\npossible, it doesn't fit the real data that is ever increasing. They may point out that the exponential function overestimates the population in the final decade of this data set. That will point the way to needing a different regression function, a suspicion that is confirmed by the next data set. 5. For the third data set, after plotting additional points, students may suggest that it is composed of several parts, such as exponential for the first third, quadratic for the second third, and logarithmic for the final third. You can then suggest that this S-shape is characteristic of the logistic function and students may use their TI-83 graphing calculators to fit a regression function to the data. 6. For the final data set, after plotting the additional points, students may decide it is best described as a cubic function, but you may want to point out that a cubic equation would have predicted a negative population for the first three decades of the 1800's. 7. A discussion of possible reasons why the population growth rate slows down in the final set is a lively finale to this activity. Students may bring up such possibilities as population density, insufficient water/sewage treatment plants, insufficient medical services for a greater population, not enough roads or public transportation, not enough schools to support a greater population.

We will also consider the entire concept of using mathematics to model a real-world situation. An important use of mathematics is its ability to take current numerical information, or data, and then make predictions of future behavior based on that data. A useful field of investigation is that of population growth, with its obvious impact on city planning, environmental concerns, allocation of resources, and many other areas. Data from previous years can indicate important trends; social scientists, economists, and many other professionals have discovered that one can also use data to predict future growth patterns. We will use data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census on the population of New York City to investigate three different predictive models. One simple possibility for population growth is that the growth is constant; in other words, that the population grows by the same amount each year. The population can then be depicted mathematically with an \"arithmetic\" sequence, a sequence of numbers where any two successive terms differ by the same amount. An example of an arithmetic sequence is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17... A more complicated model uses the premise that the growth is proportional to the present population; in other words, the larger the population, the more people are added each year. In this situation, we often say that the growth rate, say r%, is constant. The population in this case can be represented by a \"geometric\" sequence, one where any two successive terms have the same ratio. An example of a geometric sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... A third model uses the idea that the growth of the population will be proportional to two factors: the current population and also how close the population gets to some ceiling or maximal size. This model implies that initial growth may be faster, but as the constraints of resources come into play, then the growth will slow down. The full mathematical development of these three models requires techniques of calculus, and therefore we will not dwell unnecessarily on the methods used to obtain the equations. However, we can briefly summarize the central mathematical conclusions. In the first model the population y will be a linear function of time t, that is, the population y will be given by the familiar formula y = mt + b. The second model results in an exponential model of growth, in which the population y is expressed by y = y 0 e rt where y 0 is some given initial value, r is the rate, t is the time and e is the familiar 2.718... The third model results in the logistic model of c , where for the additional variables, c represents the maximal population growth, y = 1 + ae ( - bt ) which can be sustained (called the \"carrying capacity\") and a and b are constants which emerge from a particular set of data.\n56\nLet's consider the use of these three models with the same overall set of data, restricted to different time periods. The U. S. Bureau of the Census contains a myriad of information about populations of various segments of the United States from 1790 until the present. (The Constitution of the United States orders that a count of the population be held every 10 years in order to correctly apportion the seats in the House of Representatives; this raw data can then be used in variety of ways to gain interesting information about patterns of growth in the U. S.) One such set of information is the population of New York City as measured every 10 years in the Census. For the period of 1790 to 1820, the Census gives the following counts: Year Population 1790 33,131 1800 60,515 1810 96,373 1820 123,706\nUsing your graphing calculator, plot those four points using the Year as the x-coordinate and the Population as the y-coordinate and a suitable viewing rectangle; you should obtain something which resembles Chart 1. It should be pretty clear that these four data points look like they almost fall on a line; you can use the capabilities of your particular calculator to discover the regression equation line which will fit the data which gives you an answer of y = 3075.83x 5,473,441.9. Graph that equation over the set of data to observe how good a fit it is. However, you test a model by not only how well it fits given data but also how well it will predict the future. The count for 1830 was 202,589, and the count for 1840 was 312,710. According to the equation above you should expect the count for 1830 to be 155,327 and the count for 1840 to be 186,085; clearly, the mathematical model is at odds with the real data. The linear model does not account for the complexity of the information and significantly undercounts the real population. Let's consider more of the set of data next; to the data given above for 1790 to 1820, expand the data set to include the following through 1880: Year Pop. 1830 202,589 1840 312,710 1850 515,547 1860 813,669 1870 942,292 1880 1,206,299\nGraphing these in a suitable viewing rectangle should yield something resembling Chart 2. This graph should look like the graph of an exponential function, examples of which you have already seen. You can again use the capabilities of your calculator to obtain an exponential function that fits the data, yielding y = (11162 10 -27 )e .040578 x . Graph that function over the data set, and . again note the fit. Using our previous approach, the census count for 1890 was 1,515,301 and the count for 1900 was 3,437,202; our equation predicts that the figure for 1890 should be 2,265,258 and for 1900 it should be 3,398.969. The exponential equation fits the given data well, but again it is less useful when we try to expand it to cover a broader scope. Now we will consider more data; we expand the data set to include the population through 1950:\n57\n1890 1,515,301\n1900 3,437,202\n1910 4,766,883\n1920 5,620,048\n1930 6,930,446\n1940 7,454,995\n1950 7,891,957\nGraph the population from 1790 through 1950, and note how the graph initially increases very rapidly, but then levels off and increases much more slowly. Compare your graph to Chart 3. This `S' shape is highly suggestive of the model of logistic growth. If your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y = . Again, map this function 1 + (12224 10 50 )e ( -.060438 x ) . over the data set, and observe the fit. To get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it. Notice how the curve flattens out. What is the implication of such a graph? Now, let's consider the full range of data through the 1990 census. Include in your data the following: Year Population 1960 7,781,984 1970 7,894,862 1980 7,071,639 1990 7,322,564\nThe graph of the full set of data is in Chart 4; make sure your graph is similar. Note the strong fit of the curve through the data of 1950, and then how the curve fails to model the data, particularly in 1980 and 1990. Some conclusions: The first matter for us to consider here is the history of some of these models. The simplest concept of growth is one that results in an arithmetic pattern; early scientific consideration of population growth of crops and domesticated animals demonstrated this model was not sufficient to explain the observed growth. Thomas Malthus (1766 1834) was an English clergyman and political economist who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. In there, he wrote that \"population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio.\" When this idea was investigated mathematically, it resulted in the exponential model expressed above. Pierre Francois Verhulst (1804 1849) was a Belgian mathematician and statistician who is credited with first writing about the logistic model of growth in 1845, when he attempted to take into account factors, such as limited resources, that would also tend to slow down growth after time. (Our logistic equation is written in the form y = f(t); Verhulst wrote it in the form t = h(y). This form requires the use of logarithms, and apparently he coined the word `logistic' to suggest the connection between the curve and the characteristic shape of a logarithm.) Next, we need to consider the whole concept of a model in and of itself. First, one point is to recognize that while a mathematical model may fit a particular set of data, it is a somewhat dangerous perspective to feel that the model will always work. We considered three models linear, exponential, and then logistic which did a reasonable job with one set of data, but then became less accurate as the data encompassed a larger time frame. There is a danger in assuming that we can ever exactly describe a living situation with a mathematical model. There are\n58\ntechniques of chaos theory that we could call on to account for the fluctuations in the data we considered in the periods of time following 1950, but what is to say that the future data will fit this model as well? It may be that all we can ever hope for is a rough description of a living entity without ever attaining any sort of permanent exactness. Second, mathematics expands to generate more sophisticated techniques as more data is made available. Malthus had a reasonable perspective, given his time; Verhulst developed a better one, but not necessarily because he was somehow smarter he had access to more information. Complicated models require equally complicated mathematics even to obtain approximate correlation with real-world data. We can even incorporate the new field of chaos theory to further refine our model. Third, we need to be careful about assuming that just because we can describe a set of data mathematically, we have somehow discovered what is creating the data. The Americans Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed independently rediscovered Verhulst's analysis of population growth in 1920. They cautioned: \"No process of empirically graduating raw data with a curve can in and of itself demonstrate the fundamental law which causes the occurring change.\" In other words, do not mistake an ability to describe a set of data with a mathematical formula with understanding what is creating the data itself. It may be that the mathematics helps us to see some underlying principles, but the ability to extrapolate the future from a set of data is at best an inexact procedure. However, in the article which they wrote to discuss the mathematics of logistic growth and its application to population modeling, Reed and Pearl concluded: \"...the hypothesis here advanced as to the law of population growth [that of logistic growth]...so closely describes the known facts regarding the past history of that growth, as to make it potentially profitable to continue the mathematical development and refinement of the hypothesis further.\" It may still be very useful for us to study the particular model, realizing that we still do not have a full mathematical description of the phenomena being studied. In an article appearing in the March, 1998 edition of the journal Primus on the logistic curve, Bonnie Shulman warns that while the difference between the mathematics of a model and the underlying dynamics may be clear to mathematicians, \"important policy decisions are made based on the predictions arising from models.\" It is perfectly understandable that we would use mathematical models to try to predict the future, but those predictions must always be taken with a sense of caution. Biologists have studied population growth of various species extensively, and as such have repeatedly come across examples of logistic growth. Even at that, in Population Biology of Plants, John L. Harper states: \"The logistic curve remains central to population biology, not because it describes how populations behave but rather because it provides a standard base of ideal behavior against which the reality can be judged and measured.\" (Harper, p. 3.)\n59\nChart 1:\n150000 100000 50000 0 1790 1795 1800\n1790-1820\n1805 year\n1810\n1815\n1820 Series1\nChart 2:\n1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 600000 400000 200000 0 1780 1790 1800 1810 1820\n1790-1880\nSeries1\n1830 year\n1840\n1850\n1860\n1870\n1880\nChart 3:\n8000000 7000000 6000000 5000000 4000000 3000000 2000000 1000000 0 1750 1800\n1790-1950\nSeries1\n1850 year\n1900\n1950\n60\n1790 1800 1810 1820 1830 1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920\n33131 60515 96373 123706 202589 312710 515547 813669 942292 1206299 1515301 3437212 4766883 5620084\n61\nNewton's Law of Cooling Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: In this activity students read a little history behind Newton's Law of Cooling as well as using it. An experiment using the CBL to collect data and then mathematics to analyze it could be incorporated here as well; many books, such as the Texas Instruments book by Chris Brueningsen relating mathematics and science using the CBL collection device, are available. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exponential and logarithmic functions; Solving exponential and logarithmic equations; Best fit curves (optional) Objective: The goal of this activity is to give students an opportunity to learn the history behind Newton's Law of Cooling and then to use this law in several exercises. Materials: Graphing calculator; Internet access (optional) Time Frame: This activity can be completed in one class period with the exercises started in the class, the rest to be assigned as homework. The amount of time needed for this activity may be decreased or increased depending on the mathematical level of your students. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss the history of Newton's Law of Cooling with the class after the students have had time to read the information. It might be necessary to do several examples of solving exponential and logarithmic equations before assigning this activity. If additional activities are desired, the teacher should visit the cited websites (or others that may be available) to determine the appropriateness for his/her class. Additionally, if the teacher decides to run an experiment using CBL equipment, there would need to be additional preparation on the part of the teacher. Bibliography: 1. Edwards, G. H. and David E.

Substituting T0 = 340, T(1) = 100, and Tm = 70 into Newton's Law of Cooling gives: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 100 = 70 + (340 - 70)e k (1) 30 = 270e k 30 = ek 270 1 1 = e k ln = k . 9 9 1 k can be left in this form, or it can be evaluated : k = ln -2.1972 9 kt ln(1/9)t ln(1/9) t t b. First notice that e = e = (e ) = (1/9) . Now substitute the values into Newton's Law of Cooling T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 1 80 = 70 + (340 - 70) 9 1 10 = 270 9 10 1 = 270 9\nt t t\n3 1 1 1 1 = = 3 = 2t t = hours. 2 27 9 3 3 2. This time the Tm is the unknown. T0 = 200, T(10) = 150 and k = -0.05. Substituting into Newton's Law of Cooling yields: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5(10) 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5 Multiply both sides by e0.5 . 150e0.5 = Tm e0.5 + 200 - Tm\nt\n3\n2t\n63\n150e0.5 + 200 = Tm (e0.5 - 1) 150e0.5 + 200 Tm = 72.92 e0.5 - 1 3. a. Using the points (0,0) and (34,100), the slope, m, of the line is m= 100 - 0 50 = . 34 - 0 17\nThe equation of the line relating the linseed oil temperatures to the centigrade temperatures is 50 C = N 17 b. If we substitute into the previous formula, we get C = 50 (1 2 ) 3 5 .2 9 17\nThis value is lower than the 37 C that we use. c. Again, substituting the given value for N gives us 50 C= (71) 208.82 17 Newton's value is lower than the actual value. d. There are several possible explanations. One is that Newton's values were approximations; another is that the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures is not linear. A suggested additional activity would be to use the three points (0,0), (12, 37) and (34, 100) in a different model a best fit line or a quadratic equation, for example. And then see how the new model works with the melting point of tin.\n64\nNewton's Law of Cooling Student Pages\nHistory\nBesides discovering calculus, Newton experimented in chemistry and alchemy. One of the Newton results discovered is what is now called Newton's Law of Cooling. He wrote anonymously \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\" in the 1701 volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Due to Newton's fame, Roger Cotes easily deduced that Newton was the author of the anonymous paper. Using a linseed oil thermometer, because linseed oil has a high boiling point of 240 C, Newton studied the melting points of various metals and alloys. Newton devised a method for measuring temperatures of up to 1000 C. his law of cooling. Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate at which the temperature T(t) changes in a cooling body is proportional to the difference between the temperature in the body and constant temperature Tm of the surrounding medium. If one writes this statement as a differential equation and solves, one gets Newton's Law of Cooling in the form T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)ekt where T0 is the initial temperature of the heated body at time t = 0 and where k is a constant which depends on the item being cooled. Notice that this equation is an example of exponential decay decay since k turns out to be negative because the body's temperature is decreasing.\n65\nExercises: 1. When a cake is removed from the oven, it is 340. One hour later, it has cooled to 100. If the temperature of the room is 70, a. find the constant k in Newton's Law of Cooling; b. find how long will it take for the cake to cool to 80? 2. Suppose the constant k Newton's Law of Cooling -0.05. If the temperature of a cup of coffee is 200 when it is poured and 150 10 minutes later, how warm is the room? 3. According to Newton's paper, \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\", he chose the following temperatures using his linseed oil thermometer: the freezing temperature of water was 0 and the boiling point of water was 34. The Celsius temperature for the freezing of water is 0 and the boiling point of water is 100. a. Find the linear equation that represents the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures. Let the linseed oil temperatures be the independent variable. b. Newton said that body temperature using his linseed oil thermometer was 12. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for body temperature. How does this compare with the 37 C that we use? c. Newton found that the melting point of tin was 71. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for the melting point of tin. According to the Smithsonian Physical Tables, the melting point of tin is 232 C. How does this compare with Newton's value? d. From the two examples you just did, how would you explain the discrepancies between the linseed oil thermometer values that Newton obtained, and the Celsius values that we use?\n66\nEuler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: This activity highlights a mathematical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum of 1748. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objective: To develop students' understanding of exponential functions by using a problem taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator; Graphing calculator (optional) Time Frame: One 45-minute class period How to Use: Consider using cooperative groups to do this activity. At the very least, consider pairing up students to work on this activity. If students have not had much work with exponential functions, you might need to help them find the Have students consider the following historical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's highly influential pre-calculus book, Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, written in 1748: If the progression 2, 4, 16, 256, ... is formed by letting each term be the square of the preceding term, find the value of the twenty-fifth term. This example comes from Chapter VI: On Exponentials and Logarithms of Euler's book.. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. We simply want to graph the curve that models this progression. It is preferable to have students graph this curve using a graphing calculator. If there is no access to graphing calculators, have students make a table of values and graph the exponential function on graph paper. A suggested window for graphing is x: (0, 10) and y: (0, 300). Students must first determine the function that models this progression. The students should arrive at\ny = f ( x) = 2 2 .\nx\n67\nA sample table the students may make is as follows:\nx 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7At this time, students should find the twenty-fifth term is\n) f (25 = 22 = 216,777,216.\nStudents will quickly discover this expression cannot be evaluated on a calculator. It is important to stress that Euler solved the problem using logarithms--a topic that will be discussed later and connected with exponential functions. This example is a prelude to logarithmic functions--the inverse of exponential functions. Once the students have discovered the function and curve that modeled Euler's original problem, you can discuss the relationship between this function and the standard exponential function\n24\ny = f ( x) = 2 x.\nThen have the students make a comparison between the two functions. Note: Euler's original solution with logarithms to this example is provided (See Logarithmic Functions: Euler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Revisited). Later in the unit when you introduce logarithms, it would be appropriate to revisit this problem and show students its connection to logarithms and Euler's logarithmic solution. This will make students aware of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard, translated. by John D. Blanton.

Level: Precalculus. A prerequisite is the Binomial Theorem and the calculation of e as in the section \"What Will Happen If...\" Objective: To show how to calculate the power series for ex Time Frame: One or two class periods, with a homework assignment at the end. How to Use: This is a teacher-directed lesson. The Student Pages should be given to the students, but the teacher will need to present this material and answer questions about it.\n73\nCalculating ex Student Pages\nWe present here a method of calculating ex by means of a power series, a polynomial of \"infinite degree.\" We first recall the Binomial Theorem: (a + b) n = a n + na n -1b + n(n - 1) n- 2 2 n(n - 1)n - 2) n -3 3 a b + a b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nYou should make up several examples of this for practice. In particular, note that the formula is somewhat simpler when a = 1. We then have (1 + b) n = 1 + nb + n(n - 1) 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2) 3 b + b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nNext, recall the result, discussed in an earlier section of this module, that e can be found by considering the expression 1 1 + n\nn\nand letting n get larger and larger. Today, we generally write this as 1 e = lim 1 + . n n This means simply that as we let n get larger and larger, the given expression gets closer and closer to a particular number, which we have called e. Euler, however, writing before the notion of limit had been explained, would simply write 1 e = 1 + , n where n is an infinitely large number. Today, we do not generally use such concepts, and probably Euler himself knew that such numbers did not really exist. But what he meant by the phrase \"infinitely large number\" was simply a very very very large number; he used his intuition then to determine what properties such very very very large numbers would have. We will see some of these properties as we work through his argument.\nn n\n74\n1 Since e = 1 + , where n is infinitely large, we can also calculate e r . First, we note n that if n is infinitely large and r is a finite quantity, then n/r is also infinitely large. We can therefore rewrite e as 1 e = 1 + n/r It follows that\nn/r 1 . e = 1 + n / r r r n/r\nn\n.\nBy one of the basic rules for exponents, we can rewrite this in the form 1 e = 1 + . n/r\nr n\nBut we know that\n1 r = .. We therefore have, finally, n/r n r er = 1 + , n\nn\nagain where n is infinitely large. r . Of n course, we know that the binomial theorem is only valid for finite values of n, but we will assume that it is also true when n is infinitely large. After all, we are thinking of such values n simply as very very very large positive integers. However, since we do not know how large n actually is, we will only calculate the first few terms of the binomial expansion and use dots to indicate that this expression simply goes on for a long long time. Technically, this \"infinite polynomial\" is called a power series. We now apply the binomial theorem to this last expression, taking a = 1 and b = We get\n75\nr e = 1 + n\nr\nn\nr n(n - 1) r n(n - 1)(n - 2) r n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) r = 1+ n + + + + 1 2 n 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 n n n = 1+ r + n(n - 1)r 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2)r 3 n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)r 4 + + + 1 2n 2 1 2 3n3 1 2 3 4n 4\n2\n3\n4\nWe want to simplify the various terms of this expression. So we have to use a property of ``infinitely large numbers.'' In particular, we note that if n is infinitely large, subtracting 1 n -1 from n will have no appreciable result. Thus = 1 . Similarly, if we subtract 2 or 3 or indeed n any finite number from n, this will not really change that infinitely large number. We therefore n-k = 1 for any finite number k. What this means, then, is that in the expression above, have n the quantities n, n 1, n 2, n 3, ... in the numerators always \"cancel\" the factors of n in the denominators. It follows that our expression reduces to er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ( k - 1) k is usually called\nYou may know that if k is any integer, the expression 1 2 3\nr\nk factorial and is written k! Thus, our expression for e , usually called its power series expansion, is written as er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 2! 3! 4!\nThe value of the power series expansion for Euler was that it enabled him to calculate values for e r . In particular, he could calculate the value for e1 = e . We can do it as well, by substituting r = 1 into the series. We get e = 1+1+ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + + + + 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = 1+1+ + + + + + + + 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.166666667 + 0.041666667 + 0.008333333 + 0.001388889 + 0.000198413 + 0.000024802 + 2.718278771 2.71828\n76\nYour calculator can, of course, calculate e as well as e r , for any r in a fraction of a second. You may wonder how it does it. Although different calculators use different procedures for doing this, one of the ways your calculator may work is, in fact, by using the series for e r ,. Your calculator is basically hard-wired to perform additions and multiplications; since calculating with a power series just involves these operations, all that has to happen is that the calculator must perform very many of these operations very quickly. And that is precisely what it can do. Although a normal graphing calculator can probably only calculate e to 10 decimal places, it has been calculated to far more places by a computer. The first 100 decimal places are as follows: e 2.71828 18284 59045 23535 02874 71352 66249 77572 47093 69995 95749 66967 62772 40766 30353 54759 45713 82178 52516 64274 Like another important number , the number e is irrational and even transcendental. The first statement was proved by Euler in 1737. That e is transcendental, that is, that it cannot be a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, was proved in 1873 by Charles Hermite. Interestingly, these two important numbers are closely related, as we will see in the next activity. Exercises: 1. Use your calculator to determine the decimal form of the next three terms in the series for e, namely, 1/9, 1/10, and 1/11. Add these values to the value already calculated and check that you now have e calculated correctly to 8 decimal places. 2. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1. Namely, replace r by 0.1 in that series and evaluate using your calculator. Check that using the terms through the fifth power term gives you accuracy to 8 decimal places. 3. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. 4. Use the power series for e r to calculate e1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. How many terms do you need to use to get e1 to 8-place accuracy?\n77\nEquations using e Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: Students are intrigued by e and want to know more about where it is used.

Many students will answer parabola. 2. e is the basis of natural logarithms and is used in many real-life applications, such as population growth or radioactive decay. i is the -1 which is used for complex numbers and in many real-life applications, such as electricity. is used, for example, in the area formula for a circle and volume formulas for cylinders, cones and circles. 1 is the identity element for multiplication, just to name one reason it is special. 0 is a place holder, just to name one reason it is special.\n79\nEquations using e Student Pages\n1. Hanging link chains and two brothers Imagine a chain made of identical links, hanging from the two endpoints. You've probably seen such a curve as a barrier around a grassy plot or the wire suspended from telephone poles along a highway. Sketch below the shape of the curve formed by the chain. What shape does the curve look like? ________________________________\nYou are not alone in thinking about this. Over three hundred years ago two brothers of the famous Bernoulli family of mathematicians tried to figure out the equation that described it. In May, 1691, Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem in a scientific journal, Acta Eruditorum. A year later his younger brother Johann as well as two other famous mathematicians, Christian Huygens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, correctly solved this problem. In fact Jakob Bernoulli was not able to solve it; he and his brother Johann had a strong rivalry as shown in this letter from Johann to a friend. \"You say that my brother proposed this problem; that is true, but does it follow that he had a solution of it then? Not at all. When he proposed this problem at my suggestion (for I was the first to think of it), neither the one nor the other of us was able to solve it; we despaired of it as insoluble, until Mr. Leibniz gave notice to the public in the Leipzig journal of 1690, p. 360, that he had solved the problem but did not publish his solution, so as to give time to other analysts, and it was this that encouraged us, my brother and me, to apply ourselves afresh. The efforts of my brother were without success; for my part, I was more fortunate, for I found the skill (I say it without boasting, why should I conceal the truth?) to solve it in full.... The next morning, filled with Joy, I ran to my brother, who was still struggling miserably with this Gordian knot without getting anywhere, always thinking like Galileo that the catenary was a parabola. Stop! Stop! I say to him, don't torture yourself anymore to try to prove the identity of the catenary with the parabola, since it is entirely false.\" quoted from e the Story of a Number, p. 141 Actually this curve is called a catenary from the Latin word catena meaning chain. The equation e ax + e - ax that describes the catenary is y = where a is a constant that is determined by the 2a density of the chain and the tension as it is held. Calculus is required to prove that this is correct.\n80\n2. The Most Beautiful Equation\ne i + 1 = 0\nMany consider this to be one of the most beautiful equations ever discovered since it incorporates five of the special numbers of mathematics. It was discovered by Leonhard Euler, a mathematician who studied and contributed to many different branches of mathematics. Why is each of the five numbers special in mathematics?\ne _______________________________________________________________ i _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________\n1________________________________________________________________ 0________________________________________________________________ To Benjamin Pierce, one of Harvard's leading mathematicians in the nineteenth century, this formula of Euler came as something of a revelation. Having discovered it one day, he turned to his students and said: \"Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means. But we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.\" (Kasner and Newman, pp. 103-104)\n81\nIntroduction to Logarithms Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry properties of exponents) (Prerequisites: Properties of logarithms,\nObjective: To use original sources dealing with logarithms Materials: Transparency of Napier's justification for logarithms.

Be sure to find out if the students think that this is a sufficient amount of explanation for understanding. In the student Activity that follows, the students will read and then do examples demonstrating Euler's explanations on logarithms. It would be good after the students finish the activity to point out that there probably is enough information about logarithms here for mastering the basics of logarithmic functions. You may want to use each separate paragraph of the Student Activity on different days, depending on your planned lesson, or the whole Student Activity after you have completed logarithms.

(There are other explanations.) loga 1/a = loga a-1 and by the definition of logarithms, loga a-1 = y ay = a-1. Therefore, y = -1 = loga a-1. The same argument holds for the other logarithms. Part 3 8. Power rule: log yn = nz Product rule: log vy = x + y = log v + log y Quotient rule: log (y/v) = z x = log y log v 9. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. vy = axaz = ax+z so log vy = x + y. It follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. 10. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. v/y = ax /az = ax-z so log v/y = x - y. It follows that log v/y = x - y = log v - log y. Hence, the logarithm of the quotient of two numbers is equal to the difference of the logarithms of the factors.\n84\n11. If you know the logarithm of 2 and the logarithm of 3, you know the logarithms of 6 = (2)(3), 9 = 32, 27 = 33,... , 4 = 22, 8 = 23, ..., 1.5 = 3/2, 2/3, ... 36 = 2232,...and an infinite number of other examples using just these two values. See the Student Activity Calculation of Logarithms - Using the Method of Napier and Briggs for more examples. Part 4 12. The only way for the value of a logarithm to be rational is if the number is a power of the base. There are many examples: log4 8 = 3/2 (since 8 = 43/2, i.e. 8 is a power of the base 4). 13. A surd is the square root of a number that is not a perfect square such as 2 , 5 , 7 ,...\n14 Part 5 15. The rule usually looks like this: log a n = 16. loga n = p ap = n logb n = q bq = n log10 n log10 a ap = bq a = bq/p\nSince b, p and q are all constant, a is also a constant and this value has nothing to do with n, the number whose logarithm we are evaluating. 17. Looking for log2 n = q, log10 n = p (we would know this value, since it is a base 10 logarithm) log102 = 0.3010300, also log2 2 = 1 Then p/q= 0.3010300 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277p. So, if every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2. Note that this is equivalent to the usual method you gave in number 15: log10 n log10 n = = (3.3219277) log10 n log 2 n = log10 2 .3010300\n85\nIntroduction to Logarithms Student Pages\nPart 1 Read paragraph 102.

On Exponentials and Logarithms\n102. Just as, given a number a, for any value of z, we can find the value of y [= az], so, in turn, given a positive value for y, we would like to give a value for z, such that az = y. This value of z, insofar as it is viewed as a function of y, it is called the LOGARITHM of y. The discussion about logarithms supposes that there is some fixed constant to be substituted for a, and this number is the base for the logarithm. Having assumed this base, we say the logarithm of y is the exponent in the power az such that az = y. It has been customary to designate the logarithm of y by the symbol log y. If az = y, then z = log y. From this we understand that the base of the logarithms, although it depends on our choice, still it should be a number greater than 1. Furthermore, it is only of positive numbers that we can represent the logarithm with a real number. 103. Whatever logarithmic base we choose we always have log1 = 0, since in the equation az = y, which corresponds to z = log y, when we let y = 1 we have z = 0. From this it follows that the logarithm of a number greater than 1 will be positive, depending on the base a. Thus log a = 1, log a2 = 2, log a3 = 3, log a4 = 4, etc. and, after the fact, we know what base has been chosen, that is the number whose logarithm is equal to 1 is the logarithmic base. The logarithm of a positive number less than 1 will be negative. Notice that log 1/a = -1, log 1/a2 = -2, log 1/a3 = -3, etc., but the logarithms of negative numbers will not be real, but complex, as we have already noted. 104. In like manner if log y = z, then log y2 = 2z, log y3 = 3z, etc., and in general log yn = nz or log yn = n log y, since z = log y. If follows that the logarithm of any power of y is equal to the product of the exponent and the logarithm of y. For example logy = (z) = (log y), log1/y = log y-1/2 = -(log y), and so forth. It follows that if we know the logarithms of any number, we can find the logarithms of any power of that number. If we already know the logarithms of two numbers, for example log y = z and log v = x, since y = az and v = ax, it follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. In like manner log (y/v) = z x = log y log v, that is, the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished by the logarithm of the denominator. These rules can be used to find the logarithms of many numbers from a knowledge of the logarithms of a few. 105. From what we have seen, it follows that the logarithm of a number will not be a rational number unless the given number is a power of the base a. That is, unless the number b is a power of the base a, the logarithm of b cannot be expressed as a rational number. In case b is a power of the base a, then the logarithm of b cannot be an irrational number. If, indeed, log b =\n90\nn, then an = b, but this is impossible if both a and b are rational. It is especially desirable to know the logarithms of rational numbers, since from these it is possible to find the logarithms of fractions and also surds 107. There are as many different systems of logarithms as there are different numbers which can be taken as the base a. It follows that there are an infinite number of systems of logarithms. Given two different systems of logarithms, there is a constant which relates the logarithms of the same number. If. If the logarithms of all numbers have been computed in one system, then it is an easy task, by means of this golden rule for logarithms, to find the logarithms in any other system. For example, we have logarithms for the base 10. From these we can find the logarithms with any other base, for instance the base 2. We look for the logarithm of a number n for base 2, which will be q, while the logarithm with base 10 of the same number n will be p. Since for base 10, log 2 = 0.3010300 and for base 2, log 2 = 1, then p/q = 0.3010300/1 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277. If every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2.\n91\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: The students should be familiar with the properties of logarithms and exponents and have at least an intuitive understanding of sequences.) Objective: In this activity, the students will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. Materials/Resources: Student Pages for each student; calculator (optional) Time Frame: This entire activity will probably take the equivalent of three class periods, with part of the activity sheet assigned as homework. Part 4 is the most difficult part and may be omitted if necessary. How to Use: An important thing to keep in mind as you work through this is that John Napier, the inventor of logarithms, was looking for a tool that would simplify complex mathematical calculations which were done laboriously by hand. In this project, you will explore the ideas and background of the historical invention of the logarithm. This is an easy-to-follow activity that provides an excellent development of the meaning of logarithms. The teacher may need to do some of the exercises as guided practice to provide a direction for student answers.

S2: 2 4 8 16 32 S2: 21 22 23 24 25 64 128 26 27 256 28 512 29 1024 210 2048 211 4096 212 8192 213\nThe sequence S1 gives the power of 2 for the number in S2. 2. (8)(32) = 256 (512)(16) = 2924 = 213 = 8192 (128)( 4) = 2722 = 29 = 512\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe product is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the product of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 3. 8 in S2 corresponds to 3 in S1; 32 in S2 corresponds to 5 in S1; the product 256 corresponds to 8 = 3 + 5 in S1. In the second example, 512 corresponds to 9, 16 corresponds to 4, and the product, 8192, corresponds to 13 = 9 + 4. In the third example, 128 corresponds to 7, 4 corresponds to 2, and the product, 512, corresponds to 7 + 2 = 9. When multiplying the elements of S2, the product will always be an element of S2. This is because 2n2m = 2n+m. In words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. 32/8 = 25/23 = 25-3 = 22 = 8 512/16 = 29/24 = 29-4 = 25= 32 128/4 = 27/22 = 27-2 = 25= 32\n4. 5.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe quotient is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the quotient of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 6. Any two terms in S2 can be divided by considering the exponents, that is, the corresponding numbers in S1, subtracting these numbers, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. 322= (25)2 = 210 = 1026 84 = (23)4 = 212 = 4096 163 = (24)3 = 212 = 4096\n7.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe power of a term in S2 is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the power of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2.\n93\n8.\nAny term in S2 can be raised to a power by finding its exponent, that is, the corresponding number in S1, multiplying this number by the power, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. The easiest way would be to rewrite the number or numbers in S2 as powers of 2 and use the rules of exponents to evaluate the answer. When multiplying the numbers, add the exponents; when dividing the numbers, subtract the exponents; when raising to a power, multiply the exponent by the power.\n9.\nPart 2 Extending the Results 10. Yes the results from part 1 hold here also. The rules of exponents hold no matter what the base is. Let u = bn and v = bm in each of the following: L(u) + L(v) = L(bn) + L(bm) =n+m = L(bn+m ) = L(bn bm ) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(bn)/L(bm) = n/m = L(bn/m ) = L(bn /bm ) = L(u/v) L(uk) = L((bn)k) = L(bnk) = nk definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u rules of exponents definition of the function l\n11.\n94\n= k L(bn ) = k L(u)\ndefinition of the function l definition of u\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier 12. If we read sequence S3 from right to left, each number is 1 smaller than the one to its right. Thus we can extend it to the left by putting 0 to the left of 1 and then the negative integers to the left of 0. If we read sequence S4 from right to left, we see that each number comes from the one to its right by dividing by b. Since the number in S4 under 1 is b, the number to be put under 0 must be b/b = 1. Similarly, the number to be put under -1 must be 1/b. The number under -2 is then (1/b)/b = 1/b2, and so on. Yes the results from number 10 still hold. The rules of exponents hold for all integers. There are many examples that would be appropriate. We write 1/b as b-1; then 1/b2 = b-2. In general, we have 1/bn = b-n, because 1/bn in S4 is under -n in S3. The 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 can be written as 1 = b0. So a 0 exponent always means 1, while a negative exponent means 1 over the corresponding positive power of the base b. log 31 = __0_ log381 = __4_ log33 = _1__ log31/3 = _-1__ log39 = __2_ log3 1/243 = __-5_ log327 = _3__ log31/2187 = _-7\n13. 14.\n15.\nPart 4: Filling up the sequences 16. 1.0000001 1.0000002 1.0000003 1.0000004 1.0000005\nRaising 1.0000001 to a small power seems just to be 1 with 6 decimal places after the 0 and then the small power, although with more decimal places, we would find more distinctions between the numbers. In any case, these numbers are very close together, differing by only .0000001. To get to 3, however, we would need to find n such that (1.0000001)n = 3. The calculator shows that n needs to be something near 11,000,000. It is therefore not very feasible to continue the sequence in this way. 17. We must have tt = 2 because the 1 (from + ) in S1 corresponds to 2 in S2. The solution to the equation t2 = 2 is t = 2. The calculator shows that this is equal approximately to 1.414. And since we use exponents of 2 to designate numbers in S2, we also have t = 21/2. That is, 21/2 = 2. Then log2 t = log2 2 = . Since u3 = 2, we have u = 3 2 = 1.260 = 21/3. Since v3 = 4, because 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 2 and 2 in S1 corresponds to 4 in S2, we get v = 3 4 = 1.587 = 22/3. We could also find v by\n18.\n95\nnoting that v = u2, because 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. It follows that v = ( 3 2 )2. So there are two different ways of expressing v in radical form. Also, log2 u = 1/3 and log2 v = 2/3. 19. The number corresponding to is 4 2 = 1.189 = 21/4. The number corresponding to is 4 8 = ( 4 2 )3 = 1.682 = 23/4. The number corresponding to 3/2 is 8 = (2)3 = 2.828 = 23/2. The number corresponding to 4/3 is 3 16 = ( 3 2 )4 = 2.520 = 24/3 and the number corresponding to 5/4 is 4 32 = ( 4 2 )5 = 2.378 = 25/4. The logarithms to the base 2 of these numbers are, in each case, the fraction that we began with. The number in S2 which corresponds to the fraction m/n in S1 is 2m/n. Since the nth power of this number is 2m, corresponding to the fact that the product of m/n by n is m, we can write this number as n 2 . Also, since m/n is m times 1/n, we know that 2m/n is 21/n raised to the power m. Since 21/n is equal to n 2 , we can also write 2m/n as ( n 2 )m. The calculator shows that 2317/200 = 3 (to three decimal places) and also that 2306/109 = 7 (also to three decimal places). The sum of 317/200 and 306/109 is 95753/21800 and 2 raised to that power is equal to 21, again to three decimal places. Thus 95753/21800 in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. Answers may vary.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n96\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Student Pages\nPart I: Relationships Consider the two following sequences: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\n1. Rewrite the numbers in sequence S2 as powers of a single number. How are the sequences related? 2. Note that when two terms of S2 are multiplied, such as 64 and 128, their product, (64)(128) = 8192, is another term of S2. Pick a few pairs of your own to multiply. Is the product always another term of S2? You may have to extend the terms in each sequence to verify your observations. 3. Note that the number in S1 corresponding to 64 is 6, while the number in S1 corresponding to 128 is 7. The number corresponding to their product, 8192, is 13, the sum of 6 and 7. In other words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. Check that this holds for the other pairs you picked in exercise 2. 4. In a brief paragraph, summarize what you have observed. Most importantly, give a justification for your results using rules of exponents. We will now see if similar laws hold for other mathematical operations. In particular, we will examine the operations of division and taking powers. 5. Take any two terms in S2 and divide the smaller one into the larger. Do at least three cases. In each case, check the corresponding numbers in S1 of your two terms as well as their quotient. 6. After trying several pairs of terms in S2, describe how you could divide any two terms in S2 without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand. 7. Take any term in S2 and raise it to a positive integer power. Do at least three cases. Again, observe the corresponding numbers in S1 of the terms you choose and calculate. 8. After trying several cases, describe how you could raise any term in S2 to a positive integral power without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand.\n97\n9. From the previous problems, we have seen how to multiply, divide and raise to powers by relating terms in S1 and S2 in appropriate ways. Assume that you had no calculator or computer device at your disposal. How would these relationships help you to make complex computations? Explain! Part 2 Extending the Results At this point, we should try to generalize our findings and describe them with some more general mathematical symbols or notation. To do this, let's look at the two following sequences where b > 0. S3: S4: 1 b 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 b5 6 b6 7 b7 8 b8 9 ... b9 ... n bn\nWe begin by defining a function, L(x), which has as its domain the elements of S4. The \"value\" of L(x) is its corresponding term in S3. For example L(b6)=6. In general, L(bn)=n for any positive integer n. 10. Review your results from Part 1 of the project. Do you think they hold here? In particular, use the general terms of S3 and S4 to check if the properties hold. Use algebra only to show that they are true. (Do not plug in values for b. That way, you will be showing the general relationships hold.) 11. Verify that your conclusions in number 10 are actually the following in function notation. Let u and v be terms in S4. Use algebra to show the following three properties hold. L(u) + L(v) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(u/v) L(uk) = k L(u)\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier Now extend the Sequence S3 and S4 to the left as follows: S3 ... -5 -4 5 S4 ... 1/b 1/b4 -3 1/b3 -2 1/b2 -1 1/b 0 1 1 b1 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 ... b5 ...\n12. Why is it reasonable to extend S4 to the left in the way we did? In particular, why should the number in S4 under 0 in S3 be 1? And why should the numbers in S4 under the negative values in S3 be 1 divided by powers of b? Your explanation may well be by analogy to the development of the sequences initially.\n98\n13. Do the general results from number 11 still hold? Test them out by trying a few terms in S3 and S4. Show your examples. Move on when you're convinced that the rules hold for the extended sequences. 14. How can you write the quotients at the left side of S4 in exponential notation? How would you write the 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 in exponential notation? Give a brief definition of what a negative exponent means and what a 0 exponent means. At this point, recall our original sequences, S1 and S2: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\nJohn Napier, the Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms, called the terms of the sequence S1 the \"logarithm\" of the corresponding terms of the sequence S2. The word \"logarithm\" is a translation of the Greek word logarithmos which comes from the Greek words meaning ratio and number; it therefore means \"the number that counts the ratios.\" For example, he called 7 the logarithm of 128. This example shows how many ratios are required for the term 128 to be found. (Note that Napier did not use base b = 2 as in S2, but the ideas are the same.) The function developed in number 11 above is a logarithmic function for base b = 2. We now replace our L notation relating numbers in S1 to those in S2 by the new notation \"log2\" (read as logarithm to the base 2). Thus we have the following results: log21 = 0, log22 = 1, log24 = 2 , log28 = 3, etc.\n15. Use this \"log\" notation above to associate the corresponding terms of the following two sequences: S5 S6 0 1 1 3 2 9 3 27 4 81 5 243 6 729 7 2187\nFind the following... log 31 = ___ log381 = ___ In general, log33 = ___ log31/3 = ___ log39 = ___ log3 1/243 = ___ log327 = ___ log31/2187 = ___\nlogba = c if and only if bc = a.\nThis is the classic modern definition of a logarithm.\n99\nAt this point it is very important to remember that Napier did not use this kind of notation! What we are doing here is trying to see the link between our modern logarithms and the theoretical ideas behind Napier's logarithms. Again, Napier started with two related sequences and then went in a very different direction than we do. Part 4 Filling up the sequences Recall that Napier's original motivation for developing logarithms was to replace multiplication and division by addition and subtraction. The use of these sequences enable us to do this on a very limited scale. We can, for example, by the use of sequences S1 and S2 replace the multiplication 16 times 32 by the addition 4 plus 5. And we can replace the division of 256 by 64 by the subtraction of 6 from 8. But what happens if we want to multiply 3 by 7? Neither of these numbers is in S2 and will not be even if we extend the row further to the left or right. What can we do about this? What we need is to have more numbers in S2. One way to accomplish this and this is essentially Napier's idea is to use a base much closer to 1 than our base of 2. Napier, in fact, used 1.0000001. So the first few terms of his sequences, which we will label S7 and S8 looked like the following: S7 S8 1 1.0000001 2 (1.0000001)2 3 (1.0000001)3 4 (1.0000001)4 5 (1.0000001)5\n16. Use your calculator to rewrite the numbers in S8 in decimal form. What do you notice about these numbers? Given that we wanted to multiply 3 by 7, about how many numbers would we need to take in the sequence S8 in order for 3 (or even a number very close to 3) to appear? Is this feasible? Napier used some very clever ideas to shorten what looks like an impossible task. Yet he nevertheless worked over twenty years on his table. We will look a somewhat different method for putting more numbers in S2. We will first fill in S1 and then try to figure out the appropriate correspondences. We begin by putting in between the 0 and the 1. We now must determine what the corresponding number in S2 must be. We will call it t. S1 S2 0 1 1 t 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64\n17. To determine t, we need to use the properties of these sequences. In particular, we know that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2. Therefore, since + = 1 in S1, we must have tt = 2. (Why?) We can rewrite this equation as t2 = 2. What is t? Write the answer in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. In terms of the log2 notation, what is log2 t? 18. Now put 1/3 and 2/3 in their appropriate positions in S1. Let u be the number in S2 corresponding to 1/3 and v be the number corresponding to 2/3. Again using the property\n100\nthat addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, write an equation which u must satisfy. Solve the equation to determine u in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Then determine v similarly. (Note that instead of using the property that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, you may wish to use the property that multiplication in S1 corresponds to taking powers in S2.) What are log2 u and log2 v? 19. Now put and in their appropriate positions in S1. As in question 18, determine the corresponding numbers in S2 in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Do the same for the numbers 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 in S1. Determine the logarithm to the base 2 of each of the numbers you have now found in S2. 20. By analogy to your solutions to problems 17, 18, and 19, determine in exponential form and in radical form the number in S2 corresponding to the fraction m/n in S1. Use explicitly one or more of the properties relating S1 to S2. Since we have now filled in S1 with as many fractions as we like, we have also filled in S2 with lots of numbers. If we want to multiply 3 by 7, we now need to determine the numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 in S2. 21. The numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 are log2 3 and log2 7, respectively. Show that log2 3 is approximately equal to 317/200 and that log2 7 is approximately 306/109. You will need to use your calculator and the general definition of a logarithm. Find the sum of 317/200 and 306/109. Show that this number in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. 22. Find two other numbers to multiply by the method of exercise 21. You may have to experiment a bit with your calculator to do this. 23. Consult at least two reliable sources (other than the Internet) in the library and write a short biography of John Napier. Your account should include information not contained in this document. Also, find at least one major application of logarithms (not discussed in class) and briefly describe it. Your write up must be typed and be no more than two pages doublespaced.

Materials: Student Pages; Calculator (optional) Time Frame: One class period with homework assigned to finish the student activity. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss briefly the included Historical Background with the class. The teacher may also want to review the definitions and properties of logarithms and exponents. It would be a beneficial for the teacher to work the activity before presenting it to the class especially to think about different ways to get the solutions, since some of the methods of solution are not unique. Additionally, the order in which to calculate the logarithms is not necessarily the numerical order, so the teacher will want to warn the students of this fact and perhaps give some hints about what to do when. Also note that these are base 10 logarithms that are being calculated. Bibliography Katz, Victor J., A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, Addison Wesley, 1998.\n102\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Solutions\nPart I: log 1 log 1 = y 10y = 1 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 1 y = 0. Therefore log 1 = 0 (this is true for logarithms of any base) At this point it might be best to find log 10 next since it is also easy to calculate: log 10 = y 10y = 10 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 10 y = 1. Therefore log 10 = 1 log 2 Consider the following relationship: 210 = 1024 1000 = 103 210 103 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 210 log 103 Now use the power property of logarithms: 10 log 2 3 log 10 And solve for log 2: log 2 (3 log 10)/10 = (3 1) / 10 = 0.3 So log 2 0.30 log 3 Consider the following relationship: 37 2187 2 1093 2 103 37 2 103\nTake the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 37 log (2 103) Now use the sum property of logarithms: log 37 log 2 + log 103\n103\nNow use the power property of logarithms: 7log 3 log 2 + 3log 10 Solve for log 3: log 3 (log 2 + 3 log 10)/7 (0.30 + 31)/7 = 3.3/7 = 0.47 So log 3 0.47 log 4 Since 4 = 22, So log 4 0.6 log 5 Since 5 = 10/2, log 5 = log (10/2) = log 10 log 2 (by the difference property of logarithms.) 1 0.30 = 0.70 So log 5 0.70 log 6 Since 6 = 23 , log 6 = log (23) = log 2 + log 3 (by the sum property of logarithms.) 0.3 + 0.47 = 0.77 So log 6 0.77 log 7 Consider the following relationship: 72 = 49 50 = 102/2 72 102/2 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 72 log 102/2 Now use the difference property of logarithms: log 72 log 102 log 2 Now use the power property of logarithms: 2 log 7 2 log 10 log 2 Solve for log 7: log 7 (2 log 10 log 2)/ 2 (21 0.30 )/2 = 1.70/2 = 0.85 So log 7 0.85 log 4 = log 22 = 2 log 2 2(0.3) = 0.6\n104\nlog 8 Since 8 = 23, So log 8 0.90 log 9 Since 9 = 32, So log 9 0.94 log 10 log 10 = 1 (see above) Solutions for Part 2: 1. 2. Since log 1 and log 10 are exact values, an equal sign is used and since the other values are approximations, the approximately equal sign is used. Since the other numbers, such as 4, 6 and 8 are products of these prime numbers, we are able to use the approximate values for the logarithms of 2, 3 and 7. Another reason would be that there is no easy way to use the definition of logarithm to find, say log 2 since by the definition, log 2 = y 10y = 2. (Suggestion for additional activity using a graphing calculator, find the intersection of the graphs of y1 = 10x and y2 = 2, to find a value for log 2.) The values are not the same because of the approximations used in the calculations in the project. The values are not exact since approximations were used for log 2, log 3 and log 7. As an example, log 6 was found using both of the approximations for log 3 and log 2. Using a calculator, log 6 = 0.7781513, while the approximation is 0.77. The difference in values is more than 0.008. Using the calculator, log 3 = 0.4771213 and log 2 = 0.30103 while the approximations were log 3 0.47 and log 2 0.30. Both of these approximations were closer to the calculator values than that of log 6. There are many examples of other relationships such as 72 = 49 = 5 10 and so on. 5. The estimate for log 2 is too large because 210 is larger than 103 log 9 = log 32 = 2 log 3 2(0.47) = 0.94 log 8 = log 23 = 3 log 2 3(0.30) = 0.90\n3. 4.\n105\nThe estimate for log 5 is too small because the approximation for log 2 is too large and this value is subtracted from an exact value resulting in an approximation that is too small. 6. There are many approaches. One possible solution is that 112 = 121 120 = 456 Taking the log of both sides gives : 2 log 11 = log 456 = log 4 + log 5 + log 6 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.77 = 2.07 So log 11 2.07/2 log 11 1.035 (the calculator value is 1.0413927)\n106\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Student Pages\nHistorical Background Briggs and Napier each spent many years in doing lengthy computations to determine logarithms. Since Napier did not use base 10 for his logarithms, but Briggs did, this project will demonstrate Briggs' approach. Keep in mind though, that we will be finding approximations for only a few common logarithms and will not have nearly the accuracy that Briggs found when he was developing his logarithm tables. Recall the definitions and properties that you know for logarithms: Definition: logb x = y by = x Sum Property of logarithms: logb(xy) = logb x + logb y Difference Property of logarithms: logb(x/y) = logb x - logb y Power Property of logarithms: logb xn = n logb x Part 1: Find approximations for the common logarithms for the positive integers 1 through 10. Recall that common logarithms are base 10 logarithms. To help get started, there are several hints of approaches to use for finding the logarithms of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 7. log 1 = _________ log 2 __________ log 2\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem (Part 2)Let f (x) be continuous and nonnegative on [a, b] and let A(x) be the area under the graph of y = f (x) over the interval [a, x].

A point g starts at T and moves towards S at a rate\n11\nequal to its distance from S; at the same time that g starts at T, point a starts at b and moves towards i at the same rate as g's initial velocity\n\nThe distance from b to a is then the logarithm of the length from g to S\n\nThere are some immediate conclusions that can be reached, stressing the difference from this original view of logarithms and our present perspective\n\nFrom the top of the mountain, we can see that Napier's path and our more recent path of regarding logarithms as exponents clearly both get us to the top, but the paths themselves are very, very different\n\nQuoting from the preface to the Arithmetica logarithmica: That these logarithms differ from those which that illustrious man, the Baron of Merchiston, must not surprise you...concerning that matter I wrote immediately to the author himself...I journeyed to Edinburgh, where, being most hospitably received by him, I lingered for a whole month\n\nHowever, to get a sense of what they went through, consider the following\n\nIt is therefore tempting now to claim Napier must have therefore seen that he was constructing a system where the logarithm corresponded to the necessary power of 10 needed to obtain the given number, but that again is our view from the mountain, not Napier's\n\nUsing the data he had accumulated with his three tables, he was then able to calculate the logarithm values of numbers from 10 7 to almost exactly 5 x 10 6\n\nHe began with log 10 = 1 and then began taking successive square roots, using well-known algorithms for the computations needed for the roots\n\n(For\n13\nexample, if 10 = 3.162277, then log 3.162277 = .5.) Once Briggs obtained the logarithms of the primes, it was easy, using the laws of logarithms, to then generate the values of the logarithms of composite numbers\n\nIt may be somewhat astonishing to realize the work required by Briggs to obtain, in Arithmetica logarithmica, the logarithms of all natural numbers from 1 to 20,000 and 90,000 to 100,000, carried out to 14 places\n\n(For example, in his calculations to obtain the logarithm of 2 he took 47 successive square roots.) Adriaan Vlacq a few years later completed Briggs' work and completed a table for all integers from 1 to 100,000 to 10 decimals places\n\nThe ground-breaking work of Newton and Leibniz in the calculus quickly suggested applications of logarithms very far indeed from Napier's original view of the technique.\n14\nIt turned out that the method that was developed to help with computational drudgery held a vital key in the new mathematics of calculus\n\nThe logarithm took on a life of its own, separate from the astonishing levels of sheer, brute arithmetic that it both replaced and which were required to establish the first logarithm tables\n\nThe logarithm continued to play a major role in computational sciences, but it had already begun to move away from its roots\n\nOne of the more central concepts which evolved was that of a `function', namely the ability to regard an operation as the pairing of the number which was to be operated on with the number which resulted from the operation itself\n\nIn more abstract terms, it allowed mathematicians to regard the operation as an object itself, more divorced from the immediate numerical relationships\n\nThis was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations\n\nA method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings\n\nIt is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined\n\nIn an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes \"Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c\n\nRead Euler, read Euler!

social scientists, economists, and many other professionals have discovered that one can also use data to predict future growth patterns\n\nWe will use data from the U\n\nThe third model results in the logistic model of c , where for the additional variables, c represents the maximal population growth, y = 1 + ae ( - bt ) which can be sustained (called the \"carrying capacity\") and a and b are constants which emerge from a particular set of data.\n56\nLet's consider the use of these three models with the same overall set of data, restricted to different time periods\n\nBureau of the Census contains a myriad of information about populations of various segments of the United States from 1790 until the present\n\nFor the period of 1790 to 1820, the Census gives the following counts: Year Population 1790 33,131 1800 60,515 1810 96,373 1820 123,706\nUsing your graphing calculator, plot those four points using the Year as the x-coordinate and the Population as the y-coordinate and a suitable viewing rectangle;

we expand the data set to include the population through 1950:\n57\n1890 1,515,301\n1900 3,437,202\n1910 4,766,883\n1920 5,620,048\n1930 6,930,446\n1940 7,454,995\n1950 7,891,957\nGraph the population from 1790 through 1950, and note how the graph initially increases very rapidly, but then levels off and increases much more slowly\n\nIf your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y =\n\nTo get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it\n\nComplicated models require equally complicated mathematics even to obtain approximate correlation with real-world data\n\nIt may be that the mathematics helps us to see some underlying principles, but the ability to extrapolate the future from a set of data is at best an inexact procedure\n\nIn an article appearing in the March, 1998 edition of the journal Primus on the logistic curve, Bonnie Shulman warns that while the difference between the mathematics of a model and the underlying dynamics may be clear to mathematicians, \"important policy decisions are made based on the predictions arising from models.\" It is perfectly understandable that we would use mathematical models to try to predict the future, but those predictions must always be taken with a sense of caution\n\n3.)\n59\nChart 1:\n150000 100000 50000 0 1790 1795 1800\n1790-1820\n1805 year\n1810\n1815\n1820 Series1\nChart 2:\n1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 600000 400000 200000 0 1780 1790 1800 1810 1820\n1790-1880\nSeries1\n1830 year\n1840\n1850\n1860\n1870\n1880\nChart 3:\n8000000 7000000 6000000 5000000 4000000 3000000 2000000 1000000 0 1750 1800\n1790-1950\nSeries1\n1850 year\n1900\n1950\n60\n1790 1800 1810 1820 1830 1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920\n33131 60515 96373 123706 202589 312710 515547 813669 942292 1206299 1515301 3437212 4766883 5620084\n61\nNewton's Law of Cooling Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: In this activity students read a little history behind Newton's Law of Cooling as well as using it\n\nAn experiment using the CBL to collect data and then mathematics to analyze it could be incorporated here as well; many books, such as the Texas Instruments book by Chris Brueningsen relating mathematics and science using the CBL collection device, are available\n\nAdditionally, if the teacher decides to run an experiment using CBL equipment, there would need to be additional preparation on the part of the teacher\n\nSubstituting into Newton's Law of Cooling yields: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5(10) 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5 Multiply both sides by e0.5\n\nUsing the points (0,0) and (34,100), the slope, m, of the line is m= 100 - 0 50 =\n\nIf we substitute into the previous formula, we get C = 50 (1 2 ) 3 5 .2 9 17\nThis value is lower than the 37 C that we use\n\nUsing a linseed oil thermometer, because linseed oil has a high boiling point of 240 C, Newton studied the melting points of various metals and alloys\n\nWhen a cake is removed from the oven, it is 340\n\nAccording to Newton's paper, \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\", he chose the following temperatures using his linseed oil thermometer: the freezing temperature of water was 0 and the boiling point of water was 34\n\nNewton said that body temperature using his linseed oil thermometer was 12\n\nUsing the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for body temperature\n\nUsing the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for the melting point of tin\n\nFrom the two examples you just did, how would you explain the discrepancies between the linseed oil thermometer values that Newton obtained, and the Celsius values that we use?\n66\nEuler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: This activity highlights a mathematical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum of 1748\n\nLevel: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exposure to exponential functions and their graphs) Objective: To develop students' understanding of exponential functions by using a problem taken from one of Euler's most famous works, Introductio in analysin infinitorum\n\nMaterials: Student Pages;

Test them out by trying a few terms in S3 and S4\n\nThe word \"logarithm\" is a translation of the Greek word logarithmos which comes from the Greek words meaning ratio and number; it therefore means \"the number that counts the ratios.\" For example, he called 7 the logarithm of 128\n\nAnd we can replace the division of 256 by 64 by the subtraction of 6 from 8\n\nNow put 1/3 and 2/3 in their appropriate positions in S1\n\nAgain using the property\n100\nthat addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, write an equation which u must satisfy\n\n(Note that instead of using the property that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, you may wish to use the property that multiplication in S1 corresponds to taking powers in S2.)

The values are not the same because of the approximations used in the calculations in the project\n\nAs an example, log 6 was found using both of the approximations for log 3 and log 2\n\nUsing a calculator, log 6 = 0.7781513, while the approximation is 0.77\n\nUsing the calculator, log 3 = 0.4771213 and log 2 = 0.30103 while the approximations were log 3 0.47 and log 2 0.30\n\n4.\n105\nThe estimate for log 5 is too small because the approximation for log 2 is too large and this value is subtracted from an exact value resulting in an approximation that is too small\n\nOne possible solution is that 112 = 121 120 = 456 Taking the log of both sides gives : 2 log 11 = log 456 = log 4 + log 5 + log 6 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.77 = 2.07 So log 11 2.07/2 log 11 1.035 (the calculator value is 1.0413927)\n106\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Student Pages\nHistorical Background Briggs and Napier each spent many years in doing lengthy computations to determine logarithms\n\nTo help get started, there are several hints of approaches to use for finding the logarithms of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 7\n\nThis vision is synthesized from the thinking of a larg", "programming_score": 25.333288332377062, "segments_extracted": 193, "original_length": 148145, "compressed_length": 191839}

{"text": "Frustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word \"Math\"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.\n\nBecause most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nComplete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.\n\nAvoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.\n\nWrite all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.\n\nSpaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.\n\nFind out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!\n\n• Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:\n\n• Compile a list of questions about the previous assignments to ask the instructor\n\nSimilarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nTime Management\n\nComplete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible\n\nDo your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nCalculator\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time\n\nGet in the habit of carrying the calculator with you\n\nThis is a good habit to get into with your math homework\n\nUsing the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot", "programming_score": 40.83797401219836, "segments_extracted": 15, "original_length": 3771, "compressed_length": 3728}

In the prologue, she writes that \"lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college.\" Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.\n\nAnd it's not just fear. Girls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school. Testimonials in Kiss My Math fight this. Stephanie Perry, the finance director for Essence magazine, explains how she uses algebraic formulas to stay on top of the magazine's financial performance. Jane Davis, financial strategist at Polo Ralph Lauren, was hired as an assistant buyer because of her facility with math. She describes determining inventory over time by finding the mean of a list of numbers.\n\nMcKellar -- famous for playing Winnie Cooper in the \"The Wonder Years\" but also a summa cum laude math graduate from UCLA -- uses simple language and lots of illustrations to teach pre-algebra. Each chapter covers a single topic, such as the distributive property or exponents. She clearly explains each topic, and includes problems for the reader to solve (answers are in the back). The author is generous with helpful notes and shortcuts.\n\nA lively, breezy writing style makes it seem as if McKellar is sitting next to the reader.

My daughter is starting high school this month.)\n\nEspecially good are the entries called Danica's Diary, which are true stories from the author's life as a student, actress and mathematician. One is titled: Dumbing Ourselves Down for Guys: Why is it so Tempting? McKellar gives practical advice on how girls can avoid this common pitfall.\n\nHere's the chapter list:\n\nPart 2: Variable Stuff Chapter 6: The Blind Date. Getting Cozy with Variables.

Intro to Variables with Exponents. You Said: Well... That Didn't Work! Do You Sudoku?\n\nI am a mother that went back to college later in life. One of my classes was algebra. I had math anxiety and tried to find way to wiggle my way out of this class. The algebra class was very difficult for me. I could not understand the instructor or the book. I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both). So I had a six week break before I had to take the algebra class again. I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!\n\nDanica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school.\n\nIn the prologue, she writes that \"lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college.\" Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.\n\nAnd it's not just fear\n\nGirls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school\n\nShe describes determining inventory over time by finding the mean of a list of numbers.\n\nMcKellar -- famous for playing Winnie Cooper in the \"The Wonder Years\" but also a summa cum laude math graduate from UCLA -- uses simple language and lots of illustrations to teach pre-algebra\n\nMy daughter is starting high school this month.)\n\nEspecially good are the entries called Danica's Diary, which are true stories from the author's life as a student, actress and mathematician\n\nChapter 11: Didn't That Guy Say He Was Going to Call?

Sections of the text being covered in\nlecture should be read prior to coming to class. Lectures will not cover all\ntopics from each section, but students will be responsible for all topics in the\nsection.\n\nSupplies:\nIn addition to the textbook, each student must have a scientific calculator,\nseveral colored pencils, and 1/4-inch graph paper. These should be brought to\nclass with you each day.\n\nReadings:\nThe student is responsible for reading at least twice each section of the book\ncovered in class: Before and after the lecture. The student will be told in\nadvance what sections of the book are to read. If you are not able to\nunderstand something in the book, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates\nwill be grateful.\n\nQuizzes:\nThere will be seven\nquizzes, each of them administered most Thursdays at 10:35 pm; the student will\nbe able to drop the lowest score. Quizzes may not be made-up. If you miss a\nquiz you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any quizearly with the instructor's permission. Problems will be similar to those in\nthe homework or in the preceding activity. The primary purpose of these quizzesis to provide you with frequent evaluation of your content acquisition and\nto help you to reduce math anxiety. Quiz work is individual, see Note 2\nbelow.\n\nActivities:\nSeven activity\nassignments will be collected; the student will be able to drop the lowest\nscore. Activity attendance is required: Most Thursdays 10:50-12:30.\nThe student should work in groups of at least 3 people and 4 at most. During\nactivity sessions the student will work on an activity sheet and each member\nof his/her group should hand in a report at the beginning of next Thursday at\nthe latest. Activity work must be turned in on the activity pages from the\npacket. Late reports and reports from students absent from even one meeting\nwill not be accepted. A report should be neat and readable; solutions should\nfollow an increasing numerical sequence. Each member of a group will receive the\nsame number of points, so it is your responsibility to write down in each report\nonly the names of those who substantially contributed to the activity.\n\nExams:\nThere will be two Midterm exams and a cumulative final. Questions and problems\nwill deal with concepts discussed in lectures, homework, textbook, and\nactivities. Exchange of information, calculators, and supplies is absolutely\nprohibited during exams! To clarify a particular situation, the instructor\nreserves the right to a further examination, written or oral. Exam work is\nindividual, see Note 2 below. Midterm exams may not be made-up. If you miss\nan exam you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any exam\nearly with the instructor's permission.\n\nPartial\nCredit: Only substantial\ncontributions to the solution of a problem will count for partial credit. Mere\nrestating of a problem or the quoting of an incorrect fact, for example, will\nnot make you eligible for it. Students must watch out for logical mistakes, and\nmust make sure that all the hypotheses are met before recalling a particular\ntheorem.\n\nGrades:\nYour final grade is a function of the total of points awarded on the activities\nindicated above. Group homework is very helpful and greatly promoted in this\ncourse. However, it is necessary for college graduates to demonstrate individual\ncompetency on the subject. Therefore, regardless of your total of points, in\norder to get a D- or better in this course all of the following should be\nfulfilled at least:\n\nIf\nyou entered the liberal studies program on Fall 2011, you are required to get a\nC or better in all classes that you are taking for your major - this includes\nMath 320.\n\n1)\nIt is the student's responsibility\nto find out what (s)he missed if (s)he did not attend class.

{"text": "Math and Science Magnet Prepares Students for Algebra and Beyond Algebra is an important foundation for building the critical thinking skills we need for solving everyday problems. Picture yourself at the local video rental store getting ready to pay for your selection. The clerk tells you that you have a choice of paying a $25 annual membership fee, plus $1.50 per rental, or paying no membership fee and $2.75 per rental. Would you have imagined that an understanding of algebra and linear equations could help you decide which is the better deal? Or perhaps you have a job offer that requires you to move across the country from Buffalo, N.Y. to San Francisco, Calif., but you would have to cover the cost of gas for approximately 2600 miles in a moving van. If the national average for gasoline is $3.25 per gallon, how much money would you need to save to cover the cost of the move? Would you have believed that when you learned to solve algebraic expressions it would help you find the answer to this unknown variable, too?\n\nTo compete in the 21st century global economy, proficiency in mathematics is crucial. To help ensure our nation's future competitiveness and economic viability, President George W. Bush created the National Mathematics Advisory Panel in April 2006. The Panel was charged with making recommendations on the best use of scientifically based research to advance the teaching and learning of mathematics. During the past two years, the Panel held meetings around the country, reviewed more than 16,000 research studies, received public testimony from 110 individuals, and considered written commentary from numerous organizations and individuals. In addition, the Math Panel conducted, in partnership with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), a national survey of Algebra I teachers to determine what practices will best prepare American students to succeed in algebra. On March 13, 2008, the 24 expert panelists, including educators, cognitive psychologists, and leading mathematicians, released a report with actionable steps, containing 45 findings and recommendations on numerous topics. Some of these topics included instructional practices, materials, professional development for teachers, learning processes, assessments and research policies, and mechanisms. The report calls for students to attain a strong foundation in basic mathematical skills and for Americans to redefine how they view mathematics, shifting from a belief that particular people cannot learn mathematics to a belief that hard work and effort can pay dividends in achievement.\n\nSome of the report's key findings include: 1.) there should be a systematic progression in mathematics curricula from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with an emphasis on student mastery of each step; 2.) it is critical to understand and be able to work with fractions (including decimals, percents, and negative fractions), for such proficiency is foundational for algebra; 3.) it is crucial for students to demonstrate quick recall of computational facts if they are to be successful in mathematics; 4.) a student's effort in the learning process is an important factor to ensuring achievement; and 5.) teachers must have a strong understanding of mathematics both prior to and beyond the level they instruct, if students are to succeed.\n\nThe K J Clark Middle School of Mathematics, Science & Technology in Chickasaw, Ala., is a magnet school that provides a curriculum rich with many of these recommendations, and the school is producing impressive results for its students. Clark offers a rigorous and relevant mathematics curriculum with a multitude of hands-on activities to get students excited about learning. As the National Math Panel report recommends, the school's approach is systematic and emphasizes conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and problem-solving skills.\n\nUnder the leadership of Principal Dianne McWain, a 2007 U.S. Department of Education Terrell H. Bell award recipient, fourth through eighth grade students throughout the Mobile County are being prepared to succeed in mathematics and science in high school and beyond. McWain notes, \"We accelerated learning a few years ago. Now our students are so much better prepared. We integrate mathematics into the curriculum everyday and in every class.\"\n\nThe mathematics program allows students to see what is important, according to Math Department Chair Julie Boren. For example, in one algebra class, the students work in groups as they tackle a question involving which one of three candidates won the school's student council election, and by how many votes. \"They know we are not going to skip the word problems just because they are difficult. We meet challenges head-on,\" she said.\n\nThe school prepares students for algebra by providing a \"core plus\" curriculum. The \"core plus\" takes place in grades four through six, during which time the mathematics instructors teach the grade level county curriculum but add skills from the next grade level as well. By accelerating instruction, all seventh grade students are prepared for the foundations of algebra and all eighth grade students are taught Algebra I for high school credit. Clark also offers geometry for more advanced eighth graders. \"We add skills in the sixth and seventh grade that students may need to ensure they take and pass Algebra I in eighth grade,\" said Boren.\n\nClark also offers an after-school tutoring program, an in-house tutoring program that removes students from their scheduled classes to obtain extra help, and one-on-one sessions during class with the teacher to ensure that all students, even those who are struggling initially, succeed in the rigorous math program. \"It is critical that our students be competitive - it opens doors for them so they can take calculus and upper level math in high school,\" Boren asserts.\n\nStudent enrollment at Clark is determined by a lottery in which there are no academic requirements for admission other than passing the grade the student is in at the time of application. Students come to Clark from parochial or private schools and as many as 60 public elementary schools across the county. The students also arrive with very different backgrounds and levels of academic ability. Teachers work collaboratively to bridge the gap between students' initial levels of knowledge and experience and Clark's standards of proficiency required for promotion.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education named Clark a No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Blue Ribbon School in 2007 in part because it is a high achieving school regardless of its student demographic. Although 58 percent of Clark's student population consists of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, all students have improved their performance on state assessments. Beginning in 2003, Clark began disaggregating information on student performance, in alignment with NCLB's accountability measures and focus on data to drive instruction. By looking at the data on student performance, Clark was able to identify subgroups of students that were not performing as well as the school average and implemented strategies detailed in its Title I School Improvement Plan to close the achievement gap. The data showed that the subgroups that needed more attention were their black students and students eligible for free and reduced-priced lunch. Clark faculty members worked diligently to address the educational needs of those students, and data from the 2006 SAT-10 and Alabama Reading and Mathematics Test (ARMT) showed the progress students had made; on those tests there was little difference between the scores of students in the \"black\" and \"free and reduced-priced lunch\" subgroups and students in any other subgroup. In some instances, students in the \"free/reduced lunch\" subgroup outperformed students in the \"paid lunch\" group and black students outperformed non-black students.\n\nClark aims to increase their students' knowledge with each grade level. A good example of early work with the foundations of algebra is apparent in fourth grade when students study fractions. The fourth grade goal is to expose students to equivalent fractions and basic operations with fractions of like denominators. Some of the activities in the classroom might include making fraction bars and grids, and the elementary teachers use different colors with the bars and grids to help students \"see\" the fractions.\n\nTypical classrooms use a hands-on approach to help students understand key concepts. All of the teachers use games with fractions and white boards in the classroom to encourage students to be proficient. Sixth grade math teacher Angela Rocker said that her students enjoy \"Fraction Face-Off,\" in which a small group of students will be given a fraction problem and race to get the correct answer. The winner of the game will face a new group of challengers. Students use white boards to check for understanding. All of the students in the class are required to do a specific problem and hold up their answer on the boards. According to Boren, \"This is a quick way to make sure that all students are focused and understand how to complete the problem. Our students enjoy using these boards!\"\n\nParents also see the advantage of Clark's approach to math. As one parent remarked, \"My daughter doesn't even realize she's learning math. They integrate it throughout all the subjects and it's important because we can use it at home in real situations, like sewing skirts for our theater group and determining the circumference of the waists without a pattern. They also have everything a parent needs for the tools to help their child and for the child to work and get whatever they want in life.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings announced a new pilot program under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) aimed at helping states differentiate between underperforming schools in need of dramatic interventions and those that are closer to meeting the goals of NCLB. As part of the new pilot program, states that meet the four eligibility criteria may propose a differentiated accountability model. These eligibility criteria are based on the \"bright line\" principles of NCLB. (March 18)\n\nSecretary Spellings joined Intel Chairman Craig Barrett to honor Intel Science Talent Search (STS) finalists. STS is America's oldest and most prestigious high school science competition. The top prize this year went to Shivani Sud of Durham, N.C, who developed a model that analyzed the specific \"molecular signatures\" of tumors from patients with Stage II colon cancer. She used this information to identify patients at higher risk for tumor recurrence and propose potentially effective drugs for treatment. (March 13)\n\nFollowing a visit to Van Duyn Elementary School in Syracuse, N.Y., where Secretary Spellings highlighted progress toward NCLB goals in New York and across the nation, she joined Representative Jim Walsh (R-NY) and school officials at an education roundtable to discuss the state's accountability plan, standards, and assessments. She also discussed the new tool recently released by the Department known as Mapping New York's Educational Progress 2008. (March 10)\n\nSecretary Spellings continued her national tour to discuss No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in North Carolina, where she addressed the North Carolina State Board of Education in Raleigh and discussed how the federal government can support and facilitate further academic gains made by the state's students under the law. She also participated in a roundtable with educators and school administrators. (March 5)\n\nSecretary Spellings delivered remarks at the Reading First State Directors Conference and declared that with the help of the Reading First program, there have been dramatic gains in student and school achievement. She called on Congress to restore funding for the program to $1 billion, as requested in the President's fiscal year 2009 budget. (March 6)\n\nApplications for the Teaching Ambassador Fellowship positions at the Department are due April 7, 2008. These positions offer highly motivated and innovative public school teachers the opportunity to contribute their knowledge and experience to the national dialogue on education.

To obtain additional information or to submit resumes, contact the program at FSCS@ed.gov, using the subject \"Reviewer Information.\"\n\nThe Art of Collaboration: Promising Practices for Integrating the Arts and School ReformPDF (1.53 MB) is a new research and policy brief from the Arts Education Partnership. The brief describes promising practices for building community partnerships that integrate the arts into urban education systems. The publication resulted from a roundtable discussion among the directors of eight demonstration sites that are participating in The Ford Foundation's Integrating the Arts and Education Reform Initiative. (March 24)\n\nFindings from studies by neuroscientists and psychologists at seven universities are helping scientists understand how arts instruction might improve general thinking skills. Learning, Arts, and the Brain, a Dana Consortium report on arts and cognition, does not provide definitive answers to the \"arts-makes-you-smarter\" question, but it does dispute the theory that students are either right- or left-brained learners. It also offers hints on how arts learning might relate to learning in other academic disciplines. (March 2008)\n\nPublicschoolinsights.org is a new online resource aimed at building a sense of community among individuals who are working at the local level to strengthen their public schools. The site also features a variety of success stories from U.S. schools and districts that have adopted effective strategies for addressing key challenges in education. (March 2008)\n\nNearly three out of five U.S. teens (59 percent) do not believe their high school is preparing them adequately for careers in technology or engineering, according to the 2008 Lemelson-MIT Invention Index, an annual survey that gauges Americans' attitudes toward invention and innovation. The good news is that 72 percent believe technological inventions or innovations can solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as global warming and water pollution. Sixty-four percent of those surveyed are confident that they could invent the solutions. (Jan. 16)\n\nA nonprofit organization has launched a national campaign called \"Ready by 21\" that will work to help youth become better prepared for college, work, and life. Run by the Forum for Youth Investment, the initiative is intended to help state and local leaders improve education and social services during the first two decades of children's lives. The initiative urges leaders to work together on interrelated problems such as drug use, teenage pregnancy, and school dropouts. (March 2008)\n\nLegislation under consideration in Maryland and many other states is intended to ease the transition for students whose parents serve in the military. These students change schools an average of six to nine times between kindergarten and 12th grade. A proposed PDF (341 KB) multi-state compact supported by the Pentagon is intended to reduce the complications involved with these school transfers. (March 2008)\n\nCalifornia students who fail to earn a high school diploma before they turn 20 years old cost the state $46.4 billion over the course of their lives. Each year, about 120,000 students in the state drop out. The high cost associated with these dropouts is related to greater rates of unemployment, crime, and dependence upon welfare and state-funded medical care, as well as lost tax-revenues, according to a report from the California Dropout Research Project. (February 2008)\n\nAttrition would be lessened if schools offered new teachers more support and guidance, according to an Alliance for Excellent Education PDF (93.9 KB) issue brief. The report found that teachers who graduated from very selective colleges, or who had high SAT scores, were more likely to leave the teaching profession before retirement or transfer to higher-performing schools. (February 2008)\n\nThe proposition that teacher quality is a more important variable than class size and other factors will be put to the test next school year, when the Equity Project, a new charter middle school in New York City, is slated to open. Its creator and first principal, Zeke Vanderhoek, plans to pay the school's expected teachers $125,000 annually, plus potential bonuses based on school-wide achievement. Because that is nearly twice as much as the average teacher in the city earns, the experiment will no doubt garner more than just local attention. For their high salaries, Equity Project teachers will work a longer day and year and will accept some duties that fall to administrators in other schools.\n[More—The New York Times] (March 7) (free registration required)\n\nMathematics and Science Two members of the USA Today's 2007 All-USA Teacher Team find ways to inspire their high school students in economics and mathematics. An economics teacher at the California Academy of Math and Science, where many students are the children of Asian or Hispanic immigrants, taps into students' creativity. The teacher uses techniques such as student playwriting to illustrate economic principles to semester-long assignments in which students develop a proposed start-up company. In College Park, Ga., at Benjamin Banneker High School, 63 percent of students are eligible for free- or reduced-priced meals, and many students already have children of their own or wear ankle bracelets that allow law enforcement officials to monitor their movements. It is at this school that one teacher has inspired his students to learn advanced mathematics and use education as a tool to improve their lives. The school's pass rate on the state graduation exam has jumped from 85 percent to 95 percent between 2005 and 2006.\n[More—USA Today] (Feb. 25) and [USA Today] (March 3)\n\nInterest in an international robotics competition among Minneapolis schools and the community's technology sector has flourished over the past two years, from two student teams competing in 2006 to 54 teams this year. For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) is a catalyst for both public and private investments in science and technology programs in high schools, not only in Minneapolis, but across the state of Minnesota. Driving the investment among such private-sector contributors as Medtronic, Boston Scientific, and the 3M Foundation is a desire to encourage future engineers. The Minnesota Department of Education has increased its funding for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) initiatives statewide as well, providing more than $4 million to school districts between 2006 and 2008.\n[More—Minneapolis Star-Tribune] (March 4)\n\nRaising Student Achievement An analysis of recently released College Board data on Advanced Placement tests by Education Week found that while more students are taking the exams, the \"percentage of exams that received [the passing score of at least] a three…has slipped from about 60 percent to 57 percent.\" College Board spokesperson Jennifer Topiel, while noting that test scores often decline with increases in the number of test takers, observed, \"Students should not be placed into AP classes without better preparation.\" The analysis also revealed a widening gap over the past four years between black and white students earning at least a three on the exams.\n[More—Education Week] (Feb. 14) (paid subscription required)\n\nFirst-year results of a federally supported study of two reading interventions for struggling adolescent readers indicate increases in proficiency, but not enough to get students to grade level in a single year. Research firm MDRC conducted the study of the Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy and Xtreme Reading programs, with support from the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Science. It is the first of three reports under the Enhanced Reading Opportunities Study. Researchers plan to follow the 9th grade students involved in the two interventions through 11th grade.\n[More—Education Week] (Feb. 14) (paid subscription required)\n\nMore than 10,000 preschool-aged youngsters in Dallas are expected to benefit from a city-sponsored early reading preparation program that is modeled on Ready to Read. With support from an $8 million grant from the Wallace Foundation, the Dallas Public Library will manage the \"Every Child Ready to Read @ Dallas\" program, which will focus on parents, teachers, day-care providers, and others in the city who work with young children. In announcing the new program, Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert said, \"Everything revolves around reading,\" and indicated the city's annual costs for the new program will be less than $600,000, with the Wallace Foundation grant helping for the next three years.\n[More—The Dallas Morning News] (Feb. 22)\n\nResearchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believe that physical education may be linked to academic achievement. This belief is based on a national study of students' reading and mathematics test scores and the students' degree of involvement in physical education between kindergarten and fifth grade. According to the CDC researchers, the connection was most notable for girls receiving the highest levels of physical education (more than 70 minutes per week), who scored consistently higher on the tests than those who received less than 35 minutes a week in physical education. The study is available online in the Journal of American Public Health.\n[More—USA Today] (March 5)\n\nSchool Improvement Standards for school leaders, originally drafted in the mid-1990s and used or adapted by more than 40 states, have been revisited and revised by a panel of experts convened by the National Policy Board for Educational Administration and managed by the Council of Chief State School Officers.

The National Center on Performance Incentives released its study of the Texas Educator Excellence Grant program, the largest merit-pay plan in the nation. Texas education department officials were reportedly pleased with the first year's results and the study's findings. An examination of The Teacher Advancement Program (TAP), launched six years ago by the Milken Foundation and with 180 participating schools nationwide produced uneven results, with TAP elementary schools doing better than comparison schools in test-score gains, but those at the middle and high school levels lagging behind their non-TAP counterparts.\n[More— The Dallas Morning News] (Feb. 29) [Education Week] (March 3) (paid subscription required)\n\nFor more than two decades, Project STAR, a study of class size in Tennessee, has informed thinking about the policy issue of class-size reduction.

research studies, received public testimony from 110 individuals, and considered written commentary from numerous organizations and individuals\n\nThe report calls for students to attain a strong foundation in basic mathematical skills and for Americans to redefine how they view mathematics, shifting from a belief that particular people cannot learn mathematics to a belief that hard work and effort can pay dividends in achievement.\n\nSome of the report's key findings include: 1.) there should be a systematic progression in mathematics curricula from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with an emphasis on student mastery of each step; 2.) it is critical to understand and be able to work with fractions (including decimals, percents, and negative fractions), for such proficiency is foundational for algebra; 3.) it is crucial for students to demonstrate quick recall of computational facts if they are to be successful in mathematics; 4.) a student's effort in the learning process is an important factor to ensuring achievement; and 5.) teachers must have a strong understanding of mathematics both prior to and beyond the level they instruct, if students are to succeed.\n\nThe K J Clark Middle School of Mathematics, Science & Technology in Chickasaw, Ala., is a magnet school that provides a curriculum rich with many of these recommendations, and the school is producing impressive results for its students\n\nClark offers a rigorous and relevant mathematics curriculum with a multitude of hands-on activities to get students excited about learning\n\nThe \"core plus\" takes place in grades four through six, during which time the mathematics instructors teach the grade level county curriculum but add skills from the next grade level as well\n\n\"We add skills in the sixth and seventh grade that students may need to ensure they take and pass Algebra I in eighth grade,\" said Boren.\n\nClark also offers an after-school tutoring program, an in-house tutoring program that removes students from their scheduled classes to obtain extra help, and one-on-one sessions during class with the teacher to ensure that all students, even those who are struggling initially, succeed in the rigorous math program\n\nStudents come to Clark from parochial or private schools and as many as 60 public elementary schools across the county\n\nAlthough 58 percent of Clark's student population consists of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, all students have improved their performance on state assessments\n\nClark faculty members worked diligently to address the educational needs of those students, and data from the 2006 SAT-10 and Alabama Reading and Mathematics Test (ARMT) showed the progress students had made; on those tests there was little difference between the

I still have one more quarter of calculus entitled \"Vector analysis.\" I'm wondering if my poor performance (and poor understanding of the material) is going to negatively affect me later on. Will I have a chance to relearn some of the material in my other classes, or should I self study to get myself up to par? Just so you know, as of right now I'm leaning towards a Mechanical Engineering major, but I may switch into Civil (though highly unlikely.)

You then use DEs to describe all kinds of physical phenomena. So, the basic calculus skills are very important to understanding engineering.\n\nThanks HPuck.

Or should I learn other things like Taylor Polynomials and Convergence/Divergence (the stuff that tripped me up most)?\n\nCalculus is one of the few subjects you really need to put in the effort to learn well. Study all of it until you have a strong conceptual understanding of it. Bad grades are bad grades, but calculus is important.\n\nCalculus will be used in physics. Multivariable calculus will become important when you take the physics course with electricity and magnetism. Differential equations will become important in many places.\n\nTry and improve on basic integration/misc techniques (integration by parts, partial fraction decomp, trig int, partial derivations, etc) because these will be very important in DE. A lot of questions will have a lot of nested integrals/nasty integrals and you don't want to get stuck in the middle of the question. Freshen up on Taylor and Maclaurin series.

{"text": "Andrius Kulikauskas is since childhood a lifelong learner on a quest to know everything and apply that knowledge usefully. At the University of California at San Diego, he studied mathematics as a tool for conceptual thinking. He was appointed senior teaching assistant, responsible for training the first year teaching assistants. He earned his Ph.D. in 1993 for this thesis \"Symmetric Functions of the Eigenvalues of a Matrix\".\n\nAndrius taught a Precalculus class at UCSD for students who were ill prepared for Calculus. He knew the dismal state of mathematics teaching. High school teachers generally don't think mathematically. Truly, mathematics should be a tool for thinking, where the point is first to understand the relevance of various models, and only then to calculate. Unfortunately, textbooks are full of contrived, irrelevant problems which hinder mathematical intuition. Andrius taught from his own notes:  He identified the key ideas leading up to Calculus, and surveyed them all in thirty one-hour lessons. His students did very well!\n\nIn 2008, Andrius taught algebra as a Professor at American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He taught 90 business students, many of whom were unmotivated because they thought math was irrelevant, and yet they rated him an outstanding teacher. He concentrated on teaching them a few dozen classic problems which were difficult but insightful. For example, suppose that the price of a barrel of oil goes up by one-third this week, but then goes down by one-third next week. What is the overall change in price? Many people suppose that the two changes cancel out and the price is the same. But actually, if the barrel of oil costs $90, then it goes up to $120, but down to $80! And, in general, it goes up from X to 4/3 X and then down to 8/9 X. This is a very thoughtful problem and it illustrates a very deep idea, which is that algebra is the study of thinking step-by-step. If you don't think step-by-step, you can't solve this problem, because you won't know what \"one-third\" means. Most books and teachers don't and can't teach step-by-step thinking because it's a lot of work to grade. But if the problem is truly relevant, then the effort is worth it!\n\nImagine if people could use such materials without restriction! Ours will be in the Public Domain so they might be shared, adapted and improved! A teacher in Africa might print out one lesson at a time, think up a game that teaches the concept, and then write a letter how it went. People could share examples and applications from around the world!\n\nIndeed, we can set up a wiki to collect classic problems, ideas and examples in math and other subjects. A wiki is an online tool with which individual problems could be easily edited and linked together into a pattern language, as in Christopher Alexander's \"A Timeless Way of Building\". Yet each lesson can also stand on its own.\n\nAndrius will start by identifying noteworthy math problems from his own notes, from websites, from discussion groups, from colleagues online and from mathematics textbooks, especially intuitive books such as \"Applying Arithmetic: A Handbook of Applications of Arithmetic\" by Zalman Usiskin and Max Bell and \"How to Lie with Statistics\" by Darrell Huff. He will continuously look for new problems and invite others to contribute them. He will relate each problem with a deep idea that it illustrates. He will select what he thinks are the thirty or so pairs of problems and ideas which most completely and profoundly present mathematics. He will write an essay for each problem/idea.\n\nEarly in our project, Andrius will travel to Tampere, Finland to work for one month with filmmaker Teemu Takatalo at the Hirvitalo community centre. Andrius will work with activists to understand what math ideas might be relevant for their campaigns. Teemu will coach them on using video to communicate these ideas.\n\nMidway into our project, Andrius will start publishing individual lessons online. Miksike's adult learners will test the lessons and help create related worksheets. Andrius will return to work with them.\n\nAs the videos are completed, they will be published online and also made available through our wiki. Didzis Veinbergs will promote them and the activist's campaigns along with the upcoming book. Andrius Kulikauskas will visit him in Latvia and they will publish and promote a short paperback of \"Classic Math Problems\".\n\nWe will adapt the book and translate it from English into Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian and publish and promote electronic versions.\n\nOur project includes four partners from Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Finland.\n\nPispalan kulttuuriyhdistys ry (Pispala Cultural Association) runs the Hirvitalo center of contemporary art in Tampere, Finland. Hirvitalo is a base for artistic and cultural activists, including gardens and permaculture. Markus Petz is now the European Voluntary Service coordinator there. He first met Andrius on a road trip they took together to visit UK independent thinkers. Markus organized a video bridge from Hirvitalo in 2008 with Andrius about his paper \"An Economy for Giving Everything Away\".\n\nŪdenszīmes (Signs of Water) is an NGO from Jēkabpils, Latvia, that is working towards improving the possibilities of education for children and young people in Latvia, thus helping create an educated, ethical and responsible society. It was founded in 2007, and its founding members have been active in other NGOs since 1997. Ūdenszīmes will host Didzis Veinbergs's work to publish our Classic Math Problems as a paperback in the Public Domain. Didzis and Andrius met in 2008 at BarCamp Baltics. Andrius invited Didzis to Vilnius for the workshop \"Ethical Public Domain: Debate of Questionable Practices\" which Minciu Sodas organized for COMMUNIA, the European Union's thematic network for the Public Domain.

Didzis will publish, promote and distribute Andrius's book as well as provide designers and/or illustrators for related websites.\n\nWe will create worksheets for use through Miksike and other venues. In particular, we will create one-page worksheets, each dedicated to one lesson, so that a teacher can print them out on-demand when they prepare for their class.\n\nWe will distribute our printed book to at least 500 people around the world who will help promote the printed and/or online versions, bring attention to them and open up business opportunity.

We expect 100,000 people around the world to download the English version and another 100,000 people to learn from it through the One Laptop Per Child program with which we have links through Edward Cherlin's Earth Treasury, a working group of Minciu Sodas.\n\nHow will you evaluate that your project has met its objectives\n\nWe would like to see one or more of our lessons receive attention in the press thanks to its significance for some activist campaign. We would like one or more of our videos to be popular at YouTube. We will make up for each lesson a \"tag\" (like \"halfrectangle\") which can be used on YouTube, Flickr and other sites to note the uses of our classic math problems that all are encouraged to share. We would be excited to see people using such a tag system.\n\nWe wish to encourage a growing number of people that math's deep ideas and classic problems are truly relevant for thinkers and activists, especially for global issues such as climate change.

{"text": "Because algebra involves a new way of thinking, many students find it especially challenging. Many parents also find it to be the area where they have the most trouble helping their high-school-age children. With 36 half-hour lessons, Algebra I is an entirely new course developed to meet both these concerns, teaching students and parents the concepts and procedures of first-year algebra in an easily accessible way. Indeed, anyone wanting to learn algebra from the beginning or needing a thorough review will find this course an ideal tutor.\n\nDrawing on extensive research, The Great Courses and Dr. Sellers have identified the biggest challenges for high school students in mastering Algebra I, which are specifically addressed in this course.\n\nAlgebra I includes a mini-textbook with detailed summaries of each lesson, a multitude of additional problems to supplement those presented in the on-screen lessons, guided instructions for solving the problems, and important formulas and definitions of terms.\n\nProfessor Sellers takes the fear out of learning algebra by approaching it in a friendly and reassuring spirit. Most students won't have a teacher as unhurried and as attentive to detail as Dr. Sellers, who explains everything clearly and, whenever possible, in more than one way so that the most important concepts sink in.\n\nAfter taking this course, students will be familiar with the terminology and symbolic nature of first-year algebra and will understand how to represent various types of functions (linear, quadratic, rational, and radical) using algebraic rules, tables of data, and graphs. In the process, they will also become acquainted with the types of problems that can be solved using such functions, with a particular eye toward solving various types of equations and inequalities.\n\nUsing multiple techniques to solve problems\n\nAlgebra is a rich and complex subject, in which seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome, often with ease, if one knows how to approach them. Professor Sellers is an experienced guide in this terrain and a treasure trove of practical advice—from the simple (make sure that you master the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to the more demanding (memorize the algebraic formulas that you use most often). Here are some other examples of his tips for success:\n\nKnow your variables: It's easy to make a mistake when writing an algebraic expression if you don't understand what each variable represents. Choose letters that you can remember; for example, d for distance and t for time. If you have sloppy handwriting, avoid letters that look like numbers (b, l, o, s, and z).\n\nDon't mix units: If you are using seconds and are given a time in minutes, make sure to convert the units so they are all the same.\n\nSimplify: Straighten out the clutter in an equation by putting like terms together. Constants, such as 7, -2, 28, group together, as do terms with the same variable, such as 3x, x, -10x. Then combine the like terms. Often you'll find that the equation practically solves itself.\n\nAbove all, check your work! When you have finished a problem, ask yourself, \"Does this answer make sense?\" Plug your solution into the original equation to see if it does. Checking your work is the number one insurance policy for accurate work—the step that separates good students from superstar students.\n\nExamine the distinctive graphs formed by rational functions, which may form vertical or horizontal curves that aren't even connected on a graph. Learn to identify the intercepts and the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of these fascinating curves.\nPattern recognition is an important and fascinating mathematical skill. Investigate two types of number patterns: geometric sequences and arithmetic sequences. Learn how to analyze such patterns and work out a formula that predicts any term in the sequence\nThe Pennsylvania State University\nPh.D., The Pennsylvania State University\n\nDr. James A. Sellers is Professor of Mathematics and Director of Undergraduate Mathematics at The Pennsylvania State University. He earned his B.S. in Mathematics from The University of Texas at San Antonio and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Penn State.\n\nIn the past few years, Professor Sellers has received the Teresa Cohen Mathematics Service Award from the Penn State Department of Mathematics and the Mathematical Association of America Allegheny Mountain Section Mentoring Award.\n\nIndeed, anyone wanting to learn algebra from the beginning or needing a thorough review will find this course an ideal tutor.\n\nConquer the Challenges of Learning Algebra\n\nTaught by Professor James A\n\nThroughout, he presents a carefully crafted series of gradually more challenging problems, building the student's confidence and mastery.\n\nAfter taking this course, students will be familiar with the terminology and symbolic nature of first-year algebra and will understand how to represent various types of functions (linear, quadratic, rational, and radical) using algebraic rules, tables of data, and graphs\n\nIn the process, they will also become acquainted with the types of problems that can be solved using such functions, with a particular eye toward solving various types of equations and inequalities.\n\nThroughout the course, Professor Sellers emphasizes the following skills:\n\nUsing multiple techniques to solve problems\n\nUnderstanding when a given technique can be used\n\nKnowing how to translate word problems into mathematical expressions\n\nRecognizing numerical patterns\n\nTips for Success\n\nAlgebra is a rich and complex subject, in which seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome, often with ease, if one knows how to approach them\n\nProfessor Sellers is an experienced guide in this terrain and a treasure trove of practical advice—from the simple (make sure that you master the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to the more demanding (memorize the algebraic formulas that you use most often)\n\nA misplaced plus or minus sign will give you the wrong answer.\n\nDon't mix units: If you are using seconds and are given a time in minutes, make sure to convert the units so they are all the same.\n\nSimplify: Straighten out the clutter in an equation by putting like terms together\n\nChecking your work is the number one insurance policy for accurate work—the step that separates good students from superstar students.\n\nBy developing habits such as these, you will discover that solving algebra problems becomes a pleasure and not a chore—just as in a sport in which you have mastered the rudiments and are ready to face a competitor\n\nin Mathematics from The University of Texas at San Antonio and his Ph.D\n\nin Mathematics from Penn State.\n\nIn the past few years, Professor Sellers has received the Teresa Cohen Mathematics Service Award from the Penn State Department of Mathematics and the Mathematical Association of America Allegheny Mountain Section Mentoring Award.\n\nMore than 60 of Professor Sellers's research articles on partitions and related topics have been published in a wide variety of peer-reviewed journals", "programming_score": 17.43752331219694, "segments_extracted": 22, "original_length": 10724, "compressed_length": 7120}

You can visit my store and leave a comment if you wish! hugs and Happy Easter! Hernan\n\nThis lesson is the introduction to a unit on Functions for Algebra 2 Honors students. The lesson is taught at the beginning of the school year when students may not be quite prepared for the rigor of Algebra 2 Honors. It is just a general review of the basic vocabulary that will be needed throughout the unit. While we may think the lesson is touching only at the surface, students continue to struggle throughout the school year with domain, range, and function notation.\nIt is interesting to discuss the ideas of continous domains and discrete domains for Example #3 and the idea that function notation indicates the coordinate. Both of these ideas are introduced to students in this textbook here and the understanding continues to grow through the next two courses. I would be glad to send you another lesson for your dissatisfaction. Contact me at jean.adams@ocps.net\n\nno, you can teach the lesson by just placing the Foldable under a document camera.

Their system would now read2Z+B=9 and Z-B=3. When students use substitution method or elimination method, they will get Z=6 and B=3 for the answer if their algebra is correct. Hope this helps.\n\nI recently bought the Families of Functions Foldable book and am having a hard time figuring out how to put it together correctly. Do you have any suggestions?

This leaves an additional\n18-27 hours per week to study outside of class.\n\nGrading:\nThere will be daily reading and homework, but your grade will only\nbe based upon your score on the 4 tests. No make-ups will be given\nfor any of these tests. If you miss a test for any reason, you will\nget a 0 on that test. There will be an optional cumulative\ntest on the last day of class which can replace the lowest of your\n4 test scores. There will be no final exam.\n\nMy instructions\nwill predominantly be for TI-83 which is the preferred calculator for this\ncourse.\n\nOverview:\nOne of the main objectives of this course is for you to understand the basic\nconcepts of calculus well enough to know when, how, and why to apply them in\nreal-world situations and to be able to interpret and communicate the results.\nTo achieve this goal will require practice at a variety of numerical,\ngraphical, and algebraic methods.\n\nThe preface of the book provides additional detail and insight into the\nmethods you will encounter in this course\n\nIf you miss a test for any reason, you will\nget a 0 on that test", "programming_score": 22.77777777777778, "segments_extracted": 7, "original_length": 1800, "compressed_length": 2036}

{"text": "It is often convenient to represent functions as Fourier series. However, the convergence of such series is a delicate issue closely related to the theory of integration. A standard approach to integration on the real line, formalised by Riemann, is based on partitioning the domain into smaller intervals.

Lebesgue produced a better theory in which the key idea is to extend the notion of length from intervals to more complicated subsets of R. This started an area of mathematics it its own right, called Measure Theory. Most generally, this is about how one may sensibly assign a size to members of a collection of sets.

{"text": "Discrete mathematics and finite mathematics differ in a number of ways. First, finite mathematics has a longer history and is therefore more stable in terms of course content. Finite mathematics courses emphasize certain particular mathematical tools which are useful in solving the problems of business and the social sciences. Discrete mathematics courses, on the other hand, emphasize a particular guiding principle for all mathematical inquiry, namely the \"algorithmic viewpoint.\" Discrete mathematics emphasizes mathematical induction and proofs, while finite mathematics avoids proofs and emphasizes applications and intuitive understanding. Because of this, finite mathematics is a terminal math course for many students, whereas discrete mathematics is an introductory course for its constituency. In spite of differences, courses in discrete and finite mathematics have similar prerequisites and cover a number of the same topics. The main difference between the two is the clientele served. Discrete mathematics courses serve mainly computer science students, and finite mathematics courses serve students from commerce and social science backgrounds. Therefore, and unfortunately, finite mathematics courses tend to be less rigorous.

Find the height of the building in meters and then in feet, rounded off to the nearest whole number. The formula for distance fallen is y= L 2 gt\nwhere t= time in seconds, and g=gravitational acceleration (9.80665 meters per second-squared). We measure the y coordinate from the position where the brick began its fall, and we specify that y is positive upwards.\n\nThe TI-36X performs numerical integration using Simpsons Rule. To prepare for an integral, store the lower limit in memory variable A, the upper limit in memory B, and the number of intervals (from 1 to 99) in memory C. Press 0 and enter the expression, using memory variable A as the independent variable. Then press V. While the calculator is processing the data, CALC displays. When the calculation is successfully completed, the TI-36X will return the numerical value to the result line. In addition, the calculator will clear memory variable C; A and B will be equal to the upper limit. If A>B, or if C is not an integer 1-99, or if A, B, or C is undefined, Integrate Error will display, and A, B, and C will be cleared. If you want to solve a given problem again using a different number of intervals or different limits, enter values to store in memory variables A, B, and C. Then scroll to the integration problem in history and press V; the calculator will solve the same problem with the new data. The time the calculator takes to solve the problem depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of intervals. You can abort the calculation by pressing and holding T until Integrate Error is displayed. With polynomials up to the third degree, Simpsons rule yields the exact answer, so increasing the number of intervals will not change the results. However, with polynomials of higher degree and equations containing more complicated functions (such as trigonometry), increasing the number of intervals will improve the precision of the results. Note: When you perform integration with trigonometric functions, the calculator must be in radian mode. 30\n\nYou can enter up to 42 points or data pairs. When using the LN regression, you do not need to find the natural logarithms of the numbers. Enter the data directly, and the TI-36X makes the transformation. Similarly, when you want to make a prediction with the LN regression equation, you enter the value of x directly (and not ln x), and the calculator returns the predicted value of y (and not ln y).\nTi36eng1.doc TI-36X II Manual Linda Bower Revised: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Printed: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Page 34 of 48\nTo set up the problem and perform the analysis: 1.

You can change or delete data points by scrolling to the desired point and editing or pressing '. If you are in 2-VAR mode, you must delete both the data point and the frequency. You can add new points by scrolling to the last point and pressing $; the calculator will prompt you for the new data. If you add or delete data points, the TI-36X automatically reorders the list. 6. When all points and frequencies are entered: Press 8 to display the menu of variables (see table for definitions) and their current values. Or, Press 7 to return to the blank STAT screen. You can perform calculations with data variables (, , etc.). After such calculations, you can return to the display of variables by pressing 8 again. You can return to the data entries again by pressing 7.\n\nNumber system modes are second functions of keys. %| Selects decimal mode (default). When the calculator is in another number mode, press %| to return the calculator to decimal mode. Note: Normally you should keep the calculator in the decimal mode, because some of the calculators operating features are limited or nonexistent in the other modes. Selects octal mode. You can enter positive octal numbers as large as 3777777777. Numbers beyond this are interpreted as negative. Selects hexadecimal mode. You can enter positive hexadecimal numbers as large as 7FFFFFFFFF. Numbers beyond this are interpreted as negative.\nTo enter the hexadecimal digits A through F, press % and then the appropriate key shown below.\nTi36eng1.doc TI-36X II Manual Linda Bower Revised: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Printed: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Page 40 of 48\nProblem Add 456+125 in base 8 and in hexadecimal.

{"text": "the only conceptual demand that is somewhat independent of the context is manipulating the algebraic expression to yield simpler algebraic expressions. That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to \"demonstrate further\" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. \"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.\n\nThe evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem\n\nThus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A\n\nInstead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments\n\n\"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers", "programming_score": 30.830612985128763, "segments_extracted": 7, "original_length": 2757, "compressed_length": 3584}

Complex analysis?\n\nI've learned some things in data structures, algorithms, numerical analysis, combinatorics, and computability theory, mostly as a result of reading about computer programming. That stuff is awesome to me but I don't even know how you'd get there from a \"general mathematics\" background. If you want computer math I recommend those topics though, I doubt you can do much with computers unless you have at least data structures, algorithms, and computability theory - but for \"more discrete\" tasks combinatorics is a must, and for \"more continuous\" tasks you really need numerical analysis. Might even want to study some more programming-related stuff too, knowing how floating-point types are implemented would be awfully valuable if you ever want to do math-related code.\n\nI'll use 'How to Think Like a Mathematician' by Kevin Houston and skip 'The Princeton Companion' for now. Proofs seem to be very important and indeed in high-school we focused on computations.\n\nThat's just the high-school algebra I see often mentioned together with trigonometry as a prereq. for a course in calculus.\n\nI've already refreshed some high-school stuff. I think the free ebooks from CK12.org are good? Problems with exercercises or questions I can post on several fora.\n\nThe 4 MIT OCW courses are 'Scholar' math-courses, specifically designed for self-study. I've already gone through some lectures on Calculus I and I think it's all pretty good organised (recitation videos, worked examples, exams (+solutions), ... ).\nI also read when you're a Math Major (General Option) those 4 courses are required while the rest is flexible.\nThis is probably indeed far from a 'decent general background' but I guess I need to start somewhere.\n\nThanks. I think the information in your thread is going to be very helpful once I finish my 4 OCW Scholar courses. Right now I just finished Unit 1 (Differentiation) of Calculus 1, still a long way to go.\n\nUnfortunately, it's been crazy easy so far. They are still adding the units for the statistics, so I'm assuming it will get more relevant (it's supposed to be university level).\n\nIt's the sort of book that you would use to explore new topics that you might not have seen before.\n\nQuote:\n\nAm I missing some more general topics or good resources?\n\nIf you're interested in getting deeper into math, you'll probably want to find a book that helps you to transition from computation into proof-based mathematics\n\nMaybe a standard book on it, or just a questions and answer book.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"algebra\" though, as algebra is quite broad.\n\nBut yeah, work through a million questions, get used to things..\n\nI don't know how you'd get a good general overview, because there are dozens or hundreds of mathematical fields, often with overlap, but I know calculus and ODEs and I wouldn't say I \"know math\" even remotely.\n\nIt seems like abstract algebra is a good starting place since people who do \"know math\" seem to reference it a lot - set theory and number theory maybe?

{"text": "John Foradori's Math Blog\nTips to survive the mathematics journey!Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000en-UShourly1 algebra classes\n 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000John Foradori have fallen in love with the function-approach to algebra, and if I were teaching algebra 1, or even below that (as the CCSSM allows), everything would be taught from the perspective of a function.\n\nStarting with functions from day one, you can reinforce everything about the functions, domains, ranges, families, etc with each and every lesson (just about!).\n\noperations on expressions? Yep, start with a function that has the expressions you want. You can get so much more out of it. This can lead to so much more understanding. In class right now, students are dealing with rational functions in the form f(x)=a/(x-h) +k, finding the characteristics, then rewriting it as a quotient of two polynomials and comparing the graphs. Good stuff, and can be done with every type of function. I think it gives meaning to algebraic manipulation, why do we do it, what happens when we do it, and how does it really change the original function. These are powerful questions whose answers give real depth and meaning to the algebra classes.\n\nI went through the EMATHS training, but the classes I taught never really let me explore the shifts that strongly (namely statistics and AP Calculus). I had a feeling that the function-based approach was, in my opinion, stronger and more flexible than the other way, but since I never had a chance to really explore it, it wasn't cemented.\n\nIt is now. Everything that can be done in a math class can be done from a function perspective and so much more. I will never go back!\n\nThere have been questions about learning procedures, the rigor of some of the algebraic skills like \"simplifying\" expressions, applying properties, etc. It's all there, all of it. It's just a different way of getting there.\n\nI will leave this with a story. Since we were converting a rational function from one form to another, and to get the students thinking about what is going on, I took a piece of paper and told them this was a function. We can do a lot with a function in this form, and we came up with a lot of uses for it. Then I crumpled up the paper and asked how I changed the paper. Did I add anything? Did I take anything away? Is it still that original piece of paper, just dressed up differently? Then I asked about the uses of my crumpled up piece of paper. Can I do the same things? Can I do different things? I highlighted the different uses of the wad of paper by playfully tossing it around the room. When we discuss this as a group, hopefully we will get to the point that even if a function is in a different form, it really hasn't changed (check the graphs), but the uses for it have.\n\nThese students are solving the equations graphically and then algebraically, which is all I can ask for right now. They are getting more and more comfortable with the tech and with the content, which will lead to next week and more group work on some exploration activities. They are making pretty good progress!\n\n]]> Summer School Adventure! #1\n 30 Jun 2012 13:56:48 +0000John Foradori all (anyone that is taking time from their summer vacation to read this!)\n\n1. Set-up\nSetting up the technology was a bit of an issue. The biggest thing was getting the Ti-Navigator set up and running. I had to upgrade the operating systems first and do a lot of the hardware upgrades. Not a big deal, and not unexpected, but it took a few days to get them started. Finally, on Wednesday, I got the bugs worked out of the navigator, the class set up, and everything working. More on that later!\n\n3. The Students\nIt took a while to get them into the swing of things as well. Summer school is an interesting experience, and can be a very dry, extremely oppressive atmosphere (in my opinion) for the students. Since it is credit recovery, they are there because of past failures, and their attitudes about math and math classes are very negative. Put them in a room that is high stakes, for five hours a day, and this could lead to a very negative atmosphere. So far, though, the students have been really good and have been participating, especially in the last couple of days. In fact, they are very engaged, and I think I've found the reason for it:\n\nOnce I got this thing up and running, and once I got used to it (it took me a couple of days, and I think the class slowed a bit because of it), things started to roll! For example, yesterday we were dealing with exponential functions. We had a whole class discussion of what exponential growth was (I use The Matrix as an example, when Agent Smith, the bad program, develops the power to copy himself, and we discuss how long it takes him to take over a world with 8 billion people in it). With some guidance on my part, we developed the function f(x)=1*2^x, and what all the parts of the function were. I expanded it to f(x)= initial value * (growth factor)^x. We worked through some examples of finding the parts of the function, the initial value and growth factor. ( f(x)=a*(1+r)^x )\n\nInstead of the typical \"give the students a couple of minutes, let the brave one give the answer and move on,\" way of trying to tell if the students get the answer, I sent out a quick poll. It is amazing that when there is an accountability on the screen showing how many people have or haven't answered, how fast the answers come in.\n\nEvery student had an answer, and we had a discussion about the answers, about every student's answers. There were about 3 misconceptions that came up that we were able to address immediately. Every student saw their answer on the screen, and I was able to give instantaneous feedback, and students got instantaneous feedback.\n\nThis is a form of formative assessment (FA), and I've used it a lot over the last couple of days. It is amazing how effective FA's are at clearing up misconceptions fast and moving the class forward. I was trying to use them before I left the classroom, but I don't think I fully \"got it\" then. I get it now. Granted, I have a great tool to use, the navigator, and not all the math teachers have them. There are other ways to get them going. More on that in the future.\n\nI am rambling, too much coffee. I will discuss more of my views and experiences as we go through the summer.\n\nHighlights:\n—I love the technology!\n—Formative Assessments are a huge key to moving a class forward. (and you don't need the tech to do it, you just need some creativity)\n—Get the students engaged, working, and hold them to it!\n—These students, who hate math, are showing improvement!\n—Give them hope that they can do it, give them tasks that they can succeed on, and build on that success.\n\n]]> Wormeli on Differentiation\n 06 Jan 2012 18:50:10 +0000John Foradori is an excellent source on Differentiated Instruction.

{"text": "Few would argue that, through its development of science and technology, the human species has been more successful than any other in taking control of the environment and using the resources of the earth to its own advantage. It is probably equally clear that this dramatic development of science and technology is only possible because of our ability to think creatively, consistently and logically. Indeed, there seems to be a parallelism, a consistency, between the rules that govern logical thought and the rules that govern the functions of the physical universe. The physical universe is quite logical and consistent. It reveals its secrets to those who study it using creative, consistent and logical thought. And for the development of one's ability to exercise this very useful way of thinking there is probably no better approach than through the study of mathematics.\n\nSo welcome to the Department of Mathematics where you will have the opportunity to hone your thinking skills by taking some of our twenty four courses in algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus and differential equations. In addition to improving your ability to think clearly, you will also learn about many of the astounding mathematical discoveries that have been made throughout the centuries and how they can be used for practical applications in science, engineering, business and the health fields.\n\nI encourage you to humbly and enthusiastically place yourself in the hands of our experienced and capable faculty who are fully devoted to teaching you mathematics. If you do this, you will be taken on an intellectual journey to fascinating places that you cannot easily imagine. You will come away not only well prepared with the technical knowledge you need for your chosen career or field of study, but with an enhanced ability to think more clearly, more deeply, more rigorously, more analytically and more precisely about yourself and everything you encounter.

{"text": "CHAPTER 12: SETS, RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n\nA \"set\" is a collection of \"objects.\" Each object in the set is called an \"element of the set.\" The elements usually have something in common.\n\nFor example, the following, {monkey, bear, lion, giraffe, zebra}, is called a set of elements. What do these elements have in common? One answer might be that they are animals in a local zoo.\n\nNotice the symbols \"{\" and \"}\". We will call theses symbols \"set enclosures.\"\"{\" is the \"left set enclosure\" and \"}\" is the \"right set enclosure.\"\n\nThe following set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...} is a collection of objects that are numbers. The elements are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and what these elements have in common is that they are positive even numbers. Notice that the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...} has 3 periods after the number 10. These three periods, called \"ellipsis,\" mean \"and so forth\" or suggest that the elements in a set continue on forever or as mathematicians say \"continue on to infinity.\"\n\nWhen we need to represent some \"recognizable pattern\" mathematicans often use ellipsis. Consider the following set: {3, 6, 9,..., 90, 93, 96}. I have left out many numbers from this set but the ellipses suggest I am incrementing each subsequent number by 3 and the set contains all the numbers incremented by 3, starting at 3, going to the number 96.\n\nCan you see the pattern in the following? {...1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...} If you take any number in this set and multiply it by 2 you will get the next number in the set. Pattern recognition skills are very important in the world of mathematics!\n\nLet's look at this set: { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } This is a set of ordered pairs which can be used to represent points in the Cartesian Coordinate System. The points below can be represented by our set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }.\n\nans: The domain is {5, 4, 3, 6} and the range is {–3, 6, –1, 3} Comment: Notice that the x coordinate, 5, occurs twice in {(5, –3), (4, 6), (3, –1), (6, 6), (5, 3)}. Mathematicians have agreed to write an x value in the domain once even though it may occur more than once in the relation. The same goes for the range: notice the y coordinate 6 occurs twice in the relation but is written only once in the range.\n\nThere is a very special \"relation\" called a \"function.\" Functions are very powerful in the world of applications as we will see in Chapter 16 of this manual.\n\nIf each x-value of a relation has one unique y-value assigned to it, then the relation is named a \"function.\"\n\nex. 1) { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function! Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. Note the ordered pairs in blue. The x-value 1 has two different y-values, 3 and 5.\nHence, we say { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function.\n\nex. 2) { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is called a function.\nWhy? Because each x-value has only 1 y value.\n\nex. 3) { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function. Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. The x-value -7 has three different y-values 5,4,and -2. Hence, we say { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function.\n\nex. 4) { (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) } is a function.\nWhy? Because each unique x-value has only 1 y-value.\n\nCOMMENT: All functions are relations but not all relations are functions. Remember, a relation is nothing more than a set of ordered pairs.\n\n12.4 GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS VERSES NON-FUNCTIONS\n\nA set of ordered pairs that is a function will have more than one point falling on a vertical line. Let's compare the graph of a function to a graph of a non function.\n\nWe will be looking at functions in greater depth in chapter 16. This was a brief introduction.\n\nI have left out many numbers from this set but the ellipses suggest I am incrementing each subsequent number by 3 and the set contains all the numbers incremented by 3, starting at 3, going to the number 96.\n\nCan you see the pattern in the following? {...1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...} If you take any number in this set and multiply it by 2 you will get the next number in the set", "programming_score": 12.434998869545558, "segments_extracted": 20, "original_length": 4423, "compressed_length": 4113}

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \"algebra\" broadly, defining it as a \"method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance\". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is \"the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge\" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

{"text": "CalcPlot3D, an Exploration Environment for Multivariable Calculus\n\nUsing CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus\n\nOne way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures. I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments. Before giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board. Once students have seen one example using the applet, most have little trouble completing the exercise on their own.\n\nCalcPlot3D, an Exploration Environment for Multivariable Calculus\n\nUsing CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus\n\nOne way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures\n\nI often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet\n\nUsing these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves\n\nAt this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own\n\nOnce they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments\n\nBefore giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board\n\nOnce students have seen one example using the applet, most have little trouble completing the exercise on their own.\n\nWithout further discussion, let's look at some examples of how this can be done!

{"text": "(where γ = 1/√(1-v2/c2) and c is the speed of light), which relate the position and time of an observer O at rest and a moving observer O'. The novel idea of this slim, succinct book is to seek to replace reliance on these equations with geometric reasoning. Of course the \"geometry\" here is not the ordinary Euclidean geometry we all learned in high school, and which is based on circles in the sense that the set of all points at distance 1 from the origin is a circle. Here, instead, the geometry is based on hyperbolas: the squared distance of a point (x, y) from the origin is defined to be x2 – y2, so the \"unit circle\" in this geometry is really a hyperbola. The ordinary trigonometric functions are then replaced by the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh, applied to angles that show up in spacetime diagrams. (Such a diagram plots the position x and time t of an object, with t running up the vertical axis and x moving along the horizontal one; thus, for example, a vertical line depicts an object that stays motionless as time passes.)\n\nThe book starts with two introductory chapters, the first of which (very) rapidly contrasts Newton's and Einstein's physics and the second of which functions as a quick overview of the physics of special relativity, including the derivation of the Lorentz equations from the two basic postulates of special relativity (that the laws of physics apply in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers). This is followed by two chapters on Euclidean \"circle geometry\" and the non-Euclidean \"hyperbola geometry\" that will be used throughout the book, introducing the hyperbolic trigonometric functions from several different (but equivalent) points of view.\n\nThe geometry of special relativity begins in earnest with the next chapter, which introduces spacetime diagrams and a particular angle in them called the rapidity, which turns out to be the angle between a worldline and the vertical (ct) axis (ct, rather than t, because we want to measure time and space in the same units). The ideas developed here are exploited in two subsequent chapters (\"Applications\" and \"Paradoxes\") which discuss the geometric ideas behind such topics as length contraction, time dilation, the twins paradox, and others.\n\nThe book concludes with two chapters that are really just straight mathematics, no physics: one chapter (\"Hyperbolic Geometry\") discusses various models for hyperbolic geometry, and the other (\"Calculus\") offers a geometric derivation of the trigonometric and exponential functions.\n\nThe question then arises, of course, whether \"novel\" necessarily means \"better\". I found that the geometric discussions did shed some light on the underlying ideas, but I also thought at times that the calculations used in them were just disguised versions of the calculations used from a more traditional approach (which, I think, any serious student of special relativity should be familiar with, since these ideas appear so frequently in the literature). So, while I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned from it, I tend to think that it would serve best as a supplemental text for a course in special relativity rather than as a main text. (The very succinct writing style, and the total lack of homework exercises, also influenced this opinion.) The author himself may think this, because he writes in the preface that the book \"is not intended as a replacement for any of the excellent textbooks on special relativity\" but is intended as an introduction \"to a particularly beautiful way of looking at special relativity… encouraging students to see beyond the formulas to the deeper structure.\" This goal, I think, has been met: on more than one occasion as I read this book I found myself looking at other texts to compare discussions, and I generally found that the process seemed to have a synergistic effect: I got more out of both books by doing this. This is unquestionably a book that anybody who teaches special relativity will want to look at.\n\nOf course the \"geometry\" here is not the ordinary Euclidean geometry we all learned in high school, and which is based on circles in the sense that the set of all points at distance 1 from the origin is a circle\n\nHere, instead, the geometry is based on hyperbolas: the squared distance of a point (x, y) from the origin is defined to be x2 – y2, so the \"unit circle\" in this geometry is really a hyperbola\n\n(Such a diagram plots the position x and time t of an object, with t running up the vertical axis and x moving along the horizontal one; thus, for example, a vertical line depicts an object that stays motionless as time passes.)\n\nThe book starts with two introductory chapters, the first of which (very) rapidly contrasts Newton's and Einstein's physics and the second of which functions as a quick overview of the physics of special relativity, including the derivation of the Lorentz equations from the two basic postulates of special relativity (that the laws of physics apply in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers)\n\nThis is followed by two chapters on Euclidean \"circle geometry\" and the non-Euclidean \"hyperbola geometry\" that will be used throughout the book, introducing the hyperbolic trigonometric functions from several different (but equivalent) points of view.\n\nThe geometry of special relativity begins in earnest with the next chapter, which introduces spacetime diagrams and a particular angle in them called the rapidity, which turns out to be the angle between a worldline and the vertical (ct) axis (ct, rather than t, because we want to measure time and space in the same units)\n\nI found that the geometric discussions did shed some light on the underlying ideas, but I also thought at times that the calculations used in them were just disguised versions of the calculations used from a more traditional approach (which, I think, any serious student of special relativity should be familiar with, since these ideas appear so frequently in the literature)\n\nSo, while I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned from it, I tend to think that it would serve best as a supplemental text for a course in special relativity rather than as a main text", "programming_score": 17.3545282193379, "segments_extracted": 11, "original_length": 6857, "compressed_length": 6301}

{"text": "The grading scheme from the student guide is reproduced below.\nThere are three components to the student's grade.\nAs the instructor, you are responsible for the determining the\nsection component and how you will\nuse it to adjust the student's final course grade.\n\nEvaluating the section component. Since we consider cooperative\nlearning to be an essential feature of the introductory program, we\nrequire that team homework count for at least 40% of the section component.\nAside from that, it is up to you how to determine the section component\nof the grade. For example, you may choose to give weekly individual or\ngroup quizzes and/or\ndaily reading quizzes; you may choose to collect individual homework;\nyou may choose to give credit for in-class work, presentations, extra\ncredit, good team evaluations, etc. It helps to choose a system\nthat encourages study habits that you believe will contribute to\nstudent learning.\n\nInforming the students.\nIt is important that you explain your system for evaluating the section component clearly\nand carefully in your first day handout\nso that your students know how they will be evaluated.\nIt is also important to ensure that the feedback you give students on their\nsection work accurately reflects the impact it will have on their\ngrade. There are many simple ways to achieve this. One is to\ngrade section work with a median of approximately 70%. If that does\nnot suit your class, or your grading, an alternative is\nto announce the median score each time you return graded work.\n\nThe Grading System: Reproduced from the Student Guide\n\n1. The uniform component.\nThere are two uniform midterm exams and a uniform final exam.\nEach of these exams will be taken by all students\nin all sections at the same time, and are graded by all the instructors\nworking together.\nYour uniform component score will be determined from your scores on each exam as follows:\n\nAfter each exam, a letter grade will be assigned to your uniform component score using\na scale determined\nby the course director specifically for that exam.\nWe do not use the \"10-point scale\" often seen in high school\ncourses in which scores in the 90's get an A,\nin the 80's get a B, and so forth;\nthe level of difficulty of the exams will be considered.\nThe scale for the uniform component score will apply to all students in all sections.\n\n2. The section component. To help you learn the material,\nyou will be given a variety of reading assignments, team homework,\nindividual homework, quizzes and other in-class activities. Your instructor will decide how the section component is determined for your particular section and grade the section work to determine your section score.\nThe section component has the potential to increase your final grade above the baseline grade by one third of a letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to an A-, etc.); and, assuming that the assigned work is completed, this component cannot lower your final grade below the baseline grade by more than one third of a letter grade. So, if you are keeping up with the course and doing well\nin your section work,\nit will not only help you to do well in the uniform exams, but may also\nadd to your baseline grade. Similarly, if you\nfall behind in your section work, it may reduce your baseline grade.\n\n3. The gateway component. There will be one or two (depending\non the course you are taking)\nonline basic skills gateway test(s) which you need to pass by the\ndeadline announced in the course schedule. These routine tests are repeatable,\nand in general do not pose a problem for students who are keeping up with the course work.\nYou may practice each test online\nas many times as you like, and you may take\na test for a score as often as twice per day\nuntil the deadline. The gateway tests do not have the potential to raise your baseline\ngrade, but if they are not passed by the deadline, the gateway component will\nautomatically reduce your final grade in the course. Deadlines and grade penalties\nwill be announced in your class. All sections of your course have the same deadlines\nand penalties assigned to the gateway component.\n\nSection averages.\nCourse policy is that a section's average final letter grade cannot differ\ntoo much from that section's average baseline letter grades.\nThis means that the better your entire section does on the uniform exams,\nthe higher average letter grade your instructor can assign in your section.\nIt is therefore in your best interest to help your fellow students in\nyour section do well in this course.\nIn other words, cooperation counts!\n\nGrades at the university.\nMany students who come to the University of Michigan have to adjust\nthemselves to college grading standards.\nThe mean high school grade point average\n(recalculated using only strictly academic classes)\nof our entering students is around 3.6,\nso many of you were accustomed to getting \"straight A's\"\nin high school.\nStudents' first reaction to college grades is often,\n\"I've never gotten grades like these.\"\nHowever, a grade of 15/20 on a team homework assignment\n(which you might previously have converted to 75% - a high school C)\nmay well be a good score in a college math course.\nYour own instructor is your best source of information on\nyour progress in the class.\n\nDescribing the grading system to students. You should state\nexplicitly how you plan to arrive at semester grades - what exams will be\ngiven, approximately what weight they will have in the overall assessment of\nthe student's work, how team homework is counted, how much quizzes will\ncount, etc. The in-class component of the grade can be based on quiz\nscores, individual homework, class participation, or whatever you find\nappropriate. It is important to not to assign letter grades to the\nin-class component of the grade because the grades you award at the end of\nthe term will have to be in alignment with the performance of your class on\nthe uniform exams.\n\nGrade books and records. Keep a good, clear record of your\ngrades in a secure place. Don't lose it. Record all scores which\nwill count towards students' grades. Many grades complaints can be\nprevented by keeping accurate records. It's easy to forget to record\ngrades before returning papers, so record everything, including all grade\nchanges, immediately. Students are very serious about their grades and\nexpect them to be treated as a strictly private matter. You do not\nneed to keep a record of students' attendance unless you choose to, however,\nyou may want to note any extended absences.\n\nComplaints about your grading. From the point of view of\nUniversity of Michigan students, a great deal hinges on getting the high\ngrades they are accustomed to getting in high school. Many first term\nfreshman have never had a grade lower than an A! They will often\nargue persistently over one or two points. This is not a sign that they\ndon't respect you. Of course, you should treat all student\ncomplaints about grading mistakes or unfairness in a serious manner.\n\nThe Grading System: Instructor Notes\n\nThe grading scheme from the student guide is reproduced below.\nThere are three components to the student's grade.\nAs the instructor, you are responsible for the determining the\nsection component and how you will\nuse it to adjust the student's final course grade.\n\nEvaluating the section component\n\nSince we consider cooperative\nlearning to be an essential feature of the introductory program, we\nrequire that team homework count for at least 40% of the section component.\nAside from that, it is up to you how to determine the section component\nof the grade\n\nIf that does\nnot suit your class, or your grading, an alternative is\nto announce the median score each time you return graded work.\n\nThe Grading System: Reproduced from the Student Guide\n\nGrades in this math course.\nAll sections of this course use the same grading guidelines\nto standardize the evaluation process.\nYour final letter grade in the course will be based on three components:\n\nThe uniform component.\n\nThe section component.\n\nThe gateway component.\n\nYour uniform component will determine your baseline letter\ngrade for the course\n\nThe uniform component.\nThere are two uniform midterm exams and a uniform final exam.\nEach of these exams will be taken by all students\nin all sections at the same time, and are graded by all the instructors\nworking together.\nYour uniform component score will be determined from your scores on each exam as follows:\n\nMidterm Exam 1\n\n25% of uniform component score\n\nMidterm Exam 2\n\n35% of uniform component score\n\nFinal Exam\n\n40% of uniform component score\n\nAfter each exam, a letter grade will be assigned to your uniform component score using\na scale determined\nby the course director specifically for that exam.\nWe do not use the \"10-point scale\" often seen in high school\ncourses in which scores in the 90's get an A,\nin the 80's get a B, and so forth;\nthe level of difficulty of the exams will be considered.\nThe scale for the uniform component score will apply to all students in all sections.\n\n2\n\nYour instructor will decide how the section component is determined for your particular section and grade the section work to determine your section score.\nThe section component has the potential to increase your final grade above the baseline grade by one third of a letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to an A-, etc.); and, assuming that the assigned work is completed, this component cannot lower your final grade below the baseline grade by more than one third of a letter grade\n\nThere will be one or two (depending\non the course you are taking)\nonline basic skills gateway test(s) which you need to pass by the\ndeadline announced in the course schedule\n\nAll sections of your course have the same deadlines\nand penalties assigned to the gateway component.\n\nSection averages.\nCourse policy is that a section's average final letter grade cannot differ\ntoo much from that section's average baseline letter grades.\nThis means that the better your entire section does on the uniform exams,\nthe higher average letter grade your instructor can assign in your section.\nIt is therefore in your best interest to help your fellow students in\nyour section do well in this course.\nIn other words, cooperation counts!\n\nGrades at the university.\nMany students who come to the University of Michigan have to adjust\nthemselves to college grading standards.\nThe mean high school grade point average\n(recalculated using only strictly academic classes)\nof our entering students is around 3.6,\nso many of you were accustomed to getting \"straight A's\"\nin high school.\nStudents' first reaction to college grades is often,\n\"I've never gotten grades like these.\"\nHowever, a grade of 15/20 on a team homework assignment\n(which you might previously have converted to 75% - a high school C)\nmay well be a good score in a college math course.\nYour own instructor is your best source of information on\nyour progress in the class.\n\nDescribing the grading system to students\n\nFrom the point of view of\nUniversity of Michigan students, a great deal hinges on getting the high\ngrades they are accustomed to getting in high school", "programming_score": 27.009646302250804, "segments_extracted": 21, "original_length": 7775, "compressed_length": 11103}

{"text": "It always shocks me to see high school students struggling to solve simple arithmetic problems. I happened to casually glance at the algebra homework of a ninth grader one day and saw \"3×7 =\" written next to a graphing question. Evidently, he did not immediately know the answer and was probably looking for a calculator. I later learned that this student was almost failing the algebra course, but I also could not help but wonder how much trouble the actually failing students were having. It simply seemed inefficient to me that these students were trying tolearn high school math, which is best learned with a solid foundation of fundamental concepts,when they couldn't remember the math they were supposed to have mastered six years ago.\n\nThe United States is one of the world's most technologically advanced countries, yet our mathematics program, especially at the secondary level, lags behind those of other industrialized countries [1][2]. Without a solid math background from grade school, the majority of adults in the US lack basic number sense skills – according to a poll conducted by the Center for Economic and Entrepreneurial Literacy almost 80% of adults interviewed did not understand the magnitude of a trillion [3]. These people may not completely understand the true size of the US's national debt or deficit, since for them, the figures may just seem like any big number.\n\nGiven American students' poor performance in math compared to other countries, it is unsurprising to find that the US tried a series math reforms throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Until 1960's, the predominant way of teaching math, often known as the \"traditional\" approach, emphasized memorization of basic facts and standard algorithms at the elementary level, followed by an endless array of exercises to reinforce the information. The rote memorization mindset continued through high school, and even into college; it was not uncommon to see a college calculus class that mainly focused on integration formulas and differentiation rules rather than on the fundamental meaning and purpose of derivatives and integrals [4]. Textbooks presented few problems that went beyond substituting into given algorithms, and teachers rarely explained or even mentioned the reasons and principles behind these algorithms. Consequently, math often appeared as a random collection of formulas to students. Critics have called this traditional method \"parrot math\" to stress that while students\n\nUnfortunately, it was extremely difficult for students to process the abstract concepts, especially since they had very little concrete math background to build upon. For example, without a clear understanding of basic addition facts, ideas such as the Commutative Property of Addition seemed strange and unnecessary to students. According to Piaget's theory from developmental psychology, children generally do not develop the ability to perform abstract reasoning until adolescence, so the \"new math\" essentially tried to teach concepts that most children were not cognitively ready to learn [7].\n\nThe traditional approach continued to be the method of choice in schools across the US for another twenty years, and before long, arguments about students' shallow understanding of math formulas again emerged. A new movement came into focus in the late 1980's when the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) introduced a different set of standards that emphasized mathematical inquiry over routine calculations. Memorization of algorithms was nearly eliminated, calculators were encouraged, and students were asked to \"discover\" their own methods of doing basic operations. This \"constructivist\" proposal gave rise to many new textbooks in the 1990's, and it became popular as several large school districts adopted these new curriculum reforms [8].\n\nUnfortunately, students and teachers were shortly faced with a new problem. To make the curriculum seem more modern, many programs encouraged heavy calculator use and did not require students to memorize basic facts. However, without adequate practice in these essential\n\ncomputational skills, students began to have trouble with even basic arithmetic, and were rarely able to do even slightly complicated problems without technology. Also, without a methodical way to add fractions, multiply two-digit numbers together, convert between percents and decimals, or carry out other similar operations, students usually ended elementary school mathematics unable to perform these essential operations. Visualizing two fractions being added, for example, was preferred over more algorithmic approaches but only works practically for simple cases; with a problem like 2/13 + 5/16, intuition quickly breaks down and one must use more general methods [9]. While calculators have made tedious arithmetic unnecessary, basic computations show up frequently in numerous subjects that students may pursue later on, and in any case, it would be highly inconvenient for people to rely on a calculator for calculations that could be quickly done mentally with adequate practice.\n\nFurthermore, perhaps as an attempt to avoid traditional methods, books commonly used variants of the standard algorithms for operations such as multiplication, division, and fraction addition. Besides being usually longer and more time-consuming, these \"new\" algorithms also misunderstood the NCTM reform's main objective: the goal was to help students understand math by finding alternatives to the traditional approach, not to replace existing algorithms. Incorporating an antiquated, inefficient \"lattice\" system for multiplying instead of the standard algorithm, for example, neither sped up the computation nor helped the student understand multiplication [10].\n\nWith all these unsuccessful changes in math programs over the past 50 years, it is not surprising that American students are behind their international counterparts in mathematics. But we rarely think about why students from other countries can learn math more thoroughly. A\n\nlengthy study done by Ginsberg and colleagues followed the math education system in Singapore, which uses a system that would be undoubtedly classified as \"traditional\", yet is consistently ranked at the top among other countries by several international tests [11]. An internationally recognized program, \"Singapore Math\", is based on the Singapore curriculum and has also found much success by the schools that have tried it [12]. By investigating the principles behind the Singapore math curriculum, the authors found numerous flaws in our own math education system that makes our methods weaker, even though they are based on the same \"traditional\" approach as those of Singapore's system [11].\n\nThe first problem in our math curriculum is its lack of specific and unified standards. Each state is free to make its own curricula, and the NCTM guidelines are vague at best; they define objectives for a range of grade levels, and therefore different states vary greatly in suggesting when basic concepts are introduced. The inconsistent structure hinders textbook companies' efforts of developing effective programs. It also becomes harder to determine the quality of new programs because the states have distinct assessment methods that influence the results of pilot- program studies. Singapore's curriculum, on the other hand, is easy to describe because it is nationalized and unified. It is therefore much easier to produce learning materials that work for all schools and to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall curriculum [11]. While a completely standardized system is less feasible in the US because of its large size and diversity, there should be more specific national standards that prevent states from producing greatly differing curricula.\n\nThe second issue with American math education lies with the textbooks' contents. Most basic math textbooks have exercises that require little thought from the student, such as one-step formula plug-ins. Students thus cannot readily apply the principles they learn to more\n\nA related problem is that American curricula try to cover too many concepts in a single year. Partially, this is the result of the textbook publishers' attempts to satisfy as many standards and teacher demands as possible, which ultimately stems from the lack of curriculum centralization. While Singapore's standards only require about 15 topics per grade level, some state curricula contain over 50 topics to be covered in a school year [12]. Chapters and lessons therefore tend to be shorter and less in-depth. Although exposure to a diverse range of topics can arguably be beneficial, such a wide array of topics prevents deep comprehension of any specific topic. Therefore there is no time to develop the problem solving skills needed to tackle more complicated problems [11]. Middle and high school curricula tend to be similar in terms of their lack of depth. For example, Lockhart describes precalculus as a \"senseless bouillabaisse of disconnected topics\", many of which are glossed over because they are not introduced in a meaningful context [4].\n\nschool would be able to produce competent math students. Singapore teachers also undergo a rigorous professional development program in addition to extensive annual training in new skills. Meanwhile, US teachers only attend short workshops, despite the fact that these workshops are \"widely admitted to be ineffective for changing practice\", and teachers are not required to pass very stringent exams. In fact, the exam for certifying 6th grade teachers is easier than the exams given to Singapore sixth graders [11].\n\nTailoring the curriculum to students of different abilities, commonly called \"tracking\", is also important to ensure that all students master the material, not just the most able ones. A study showed that programs that offered more comprehensive tracking systems scored higher on math achievement tests, even after adjusting for student backgrounds [13]. Singapore addresses this problem by providing a complete alternative program for struggling students that focuses more on repetition and is taught by well-qualified teachers. By contrast, while the US provides resources for less able students, most special programs for slower math students in the US follow no real framework; students who fall behind are generally put into unofficial \"extra-help\" classes that are taught by aides who often have not earned a college degree. If all citizens are to have good basic math skills, then the needs of all students must be addressed and equal attention should be given to those who require more time or a different approach to grasp the material [11].\n\nNewly implementing the program for first-grade students is not much more straightforward. Although students may yet not be accustomed to the \"American way\" like older students are, there are still other differences that prevent a smooth transition. As similar as the resources may be, the quality teachers will still differ between the two countries. The Singapore program presumes training in important methods used throughout the program, which in turn presumes a level of mathematical competence that may be higher than that of many US teachers. A lengthy professional program to train teachers in the US is conceivable but would be extremely expensive and require a large commitment that teachers' unions may resist [11]. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on math and science in school is vastly different between the two countries. Not only is the average school day in Asian countries longer, but also the proportion of time spent on math in school is also much greater in Asian schools. Unless more drastic reforms like lengthening the school day are considered, schools that plan to adopt a Singaporean math program must find ways to accommodate the greater required time commitment without significantly affecting the normal structure of the school day [14].\n\nOver the past 30 or so years I have been following calls for educational (K-12) reform, math and science educational reform, saw oh so many task forces, blue ribbon commissions, expensive consultant-produced studies, thousands comments of hopeful or confused and off-target members of the public, all the way from Adm. Rickover commission to Bush's No Child Left behind etc.\n\nThis country, i.e. the middle class and its hopes for maintaining standard of living or at least preventing its further erosion, needs to have its education-industrial complex, it (in essence non-existing, globally really competitive) workforce training, some of its corporate priorities, globally proven governmental economic policies and somehow revised social contract aligned toward EXPORT-oriented business and societal mindset.\n\nAlong these lines we (again, the middle class hopes for reasonable standard of living) also radically change our value system and instead having so many students majoring in business, marketing, communication, creative writing, etc. etc. down to law believe in, appreciate, build export based job and career future for graduates of engineering, math, hard science fields.\n\nIs this going to happen?\n\nUnfortunately not, as cultural habits and preferences we share and keep so dear, along with our model of individualistic-at-any cost of capitalism (compared to say a continental/German/Scandinavian/Japanese version of capitalism) are – along with legislative bodies being bought by the top 1% will prevent any REAL, bona fide chance of such fundamental reform.\n\nObama's daughters will not also study engineering or science but might do law or something \"soft\" as the middle class will not start sending their kids to study science, math, engineering.\n\nOur pride, inertia, ideology will continue to prevent us from adopting system such as in Germany, demonstrating, year after year, that yes, it is i possible to \"spoil\" workers with high wages, give them 6 weeks of annual paid vacation, universal health care, strong labor and environmental regulations, even strong euro (yes) and have the economy make so many HIGH-VALUE-added TANGIBLE products that the rest of the world is willing to buy to have export surpluses so large that only in 2009 another export-oriented giant, 15-times larger Peoples Republic of China took over as #1 exporter.\n\nTo close: math education at K-12 levels is outrage as I know, as MS in engineering, parent of six children (with top SAT scores and successful professional careers) and someone who have kept my hopes that it will get better. Sorry to say, also feminization of our K-12 system doesn't help either while it seems to \"help\" obsessive emphasis on writing, creative/persuasive writing as we have been increasingly trying to sell each other services with increasingly \"sophisticated\" spiel, while export-oriented countries flood our market with their tangible products.\n\nFirst, thanks for the history lesson above in this article! But did you ever stop to think as we are getting closer to how the brain really works and the technology of brain scans we can do are showing the different areas of how and what the brain can do and can not do. So, my question for all of you who think it is because, \" Oh they need to try harder\" and \"they are just lazy\" or \" they just do not have the right tutor\" How sadly wrong you are and how many students fall through the cracks of the educational system that makes students fit a certain system that needed up grading years ago!\n\nSecondly, it is simple logical answer, students may have a severe math disorder that will not allow them to go as far as their school program requires them too. What I mean by math disorder it is one that neurologically can not be helped by a tutor or taking a pill either! So, you say that student shouldn't go into that program! I know a student who is in a PhD program but yet can only do 9th grade level math! This student is exceptional in all areas of the program but the math. The math isn't really needed in the program since in the \"real world\" they use computers to compute the math problems.\n\nThirdly, all of those who have gone through the educational system of the universities and jumped through their hoops will good for you and I mean it! You are the few lucky ones that can actually do it. But that is ONLY because your genetic make-up doesn't have any faulty neurological problems that will interfere with your educational endeavors. However, I bet those that have been through the educational system may have Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis later in their late years of life and other elements that we can all see. I needed to bring this up in my post here is these individuals who have passed their educational programs feel they are \"privileged\" and that everyone else should go through the same thing they went through especially attorneys when they have to take the seditious bar exam as one example. These same individuals really have a problem with others who can not do what they just accomplished. All I can say to those who do not and have not had to deal with neurological set backs in the educational system you are very fortunate and very lucky too I might add! You are not any more special than the rest of us and all of us humans have some sort of element that we have to deal with in our life we are ALL fallibly creatures!\n\nAnd lastly, here is a list of famous people who were/are very successful without math! They all had something in common too they had some kind of math/educational disability. Here is the list: Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, George Washington, Leonardo da Vinci. Of course this list can go on and on but yet it has been talked about over and over the gifted really do not fit the molds these universities so make it to be the only way to succeed. I'm not surprised that Yale University originally wrote this article they are one of many universities that perpetuate this way of thinking. May the creative and the intelligence people rise above oppression ..like the late Steve Jobs!\n\nAs I have struggled to help kids learn, I am struck by *how many* kids seem unable to memorize multiplication facts–even after repeated coaching and drills. I have tried having the kids write out the tables, quizzing them orally, having them listen to CDS and even after months of work, they still fail. It is not a lack of effort on their part or mine, it is something else. Keep in mind that these kids do not have diagnosed learning disabilities, are not struggling to learn in a second language, and are not from America's most impoverished regions.\nI can't shake the gut feeling that something is seriously wrong with many of America's children, although I don't have a clue what it is. Bad diet? Too much electronic entertainment that has destroyed their ability to focus? Has cell phone radiation impaired their memory? (Don't laugh. It seems to impair learning in lab rats.)\nMaybe I was clueless as a kid, but it seems to me that 40 years ago, nearly all kids knew their multiplication tables by the end of third grade. Of course, teachers reviewed it every year to be sure, but most of us knew.\nI would appreciate comments from other teachers on this phenomenon.\n\nWithout a solid math background from grade school, the majority of adults in the US lack basic number sense skills – according to a poll conducted by the Center for Economic and Entrepreneurial Literacy almost 80% of adults interviewed did not understand the magnitude of a trillion [3]\n\nAccording to Piaget's theory from developmental psychology, children generally do not develop the ability to perform abstract reasoning until adolescence, so the \"new math\" essentially tried to teach concepts that most children were not cognitively ready to learn [7].\n\nAs in the traditional approach, students had weak math foundations because they did not completely understand the ideas of the \"new math\"\n\nTo make the curriculum seem more modern, many programs encouraged heavy calculator use and did not require students to memorize basic facts\n\nBut we rarely think about why students from other countries can learn math more thoroughly\n\nWhile a completely standardized system is less feasible in the US because of its large size and diversity, there should be more specific national standards that prevent states from producing greatly differing curricula.\n\nThe second issue with American math education lies with the textbooks' contents\n\nMost basic math textbooks have exercises that require little thought from the student, such as one-step formula plug-ins\n\nPartially, this is the result of the textbook publishers' attempts to satisfy as many standards and teacher demands as possible, which ultimately stems from the lack of curriculum centralization\n\nWhile Singapore's standards only require about 15 topics per grade level, some state curricula contain over 50 topics to be covered in a school year [12]\n\nBy contrast, while the US provides resources for less able students, most special programs for slower math students in the US follow no real framework;

Figure 1\nshows a vector in R3R3, drawn as an arrow from the origin to the point xx.\nOur geometric intuition begins to fail above three dimensions, but the linear\nalgebra is completely general.\n\nThe difference between the vector x=111x=111 and the\nvector y=001y=001 is the vector z=x-y=110z=x-y=110. These vectors are illustrated in Figure 2. You can see that this result is consistent with the definition of\nvector subtraction in Equation 3. You can also picture the subtraction in\nFigure 2 by mentally reversing the direction of vector yy to get -y-y and then\nadding it to xx by sliding it to the position where its tail coincides with the\nhead of vector xx. (The head is the end with the arrow.) When you slide a\nvector to a new position for adding to another vector, you must not change\nits length or direction.\n\nScalar Product. Several different kinds of vector multiplication are\ndefined.2 We begin with the scalar product. Scalar multiplication is defined\nfor scalar aa and vector xx as\n\nFigure 3: The Scalar Product axax\n\nCompute and plot the scalar product axax when x=11/2l/4x=11/2l/4 for\neach of the following scalars:\n\nGiven vectors x,y,z∈Rnx,y,z∈Rn and the scalar a∈Ra∈R, prove the\nfollowing identities:\n\nIn a formal development of linear algebra, the abstract concept of a\nvector space plays a fundamental role. We will leave such concepts to a\ncomplete course in linear algebra and introduce only the functional techniques\nnecessary to solve the problems at hand.\n\nThe division of two vectors is undefined, although three different \"divisions\" are defined\n\nA real number by itself is called a scalar, in distinction from\na vector or a matrix\n\nFigure 1\nshows a vector in R3R3, drawn as an arrow from the origin to the point xx.\nOur geometric intuition begins to fail above three dimensions, but the linear\nalgebra is completely general.\n\nFigure 1: A Vector in R3\n\nWe sometimes find it useful to sketch vectors with more than three\ndimensions in the same way as the three-dimensional vector of Figure 1\n\nYou can also picture the subtraction in\nFigure 2 by mentally reversing the direction of vector yy to get -y-y and then\nadding it to xx by sliding it to the position where its tail coincides with the\nhead of vector xx", "programming_score": 17.103448275862068, "segments_extracted": 13, "original_length": 3625, "compressed_length": 3048}

{"text": "Number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., and related objects that arise in their study. It is tempting to assume that something as simple as the counting numbers must be rather well understood. But this is far from the case! Indeed, number theory owes much of its charm to the wealth of easily-stated problems -- possible to explain to middle-school age children -- which have so far defied solution, despite hundreds of years of effort by great mathematicians.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the foundational results, with particular attention paid to some the pathbreaking accomplishments of the 18th and 19th centuries. We will start with the basic theory (factorization into primes) before turning to Gauss's theory of congruences. The theory of congruences culminates with a proof of Gauss's Aureum Theorema (golden theorem), the law of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nMore advanced topics will be discussed later in the course. Possibilities include theorems about sums of squares, results on arithmetic functions, and results on the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nNumber theory, more than some other areas of mathematics, is largely an experimental science. It is recommended (but not required) that you download software that allows you to play with very large numbers. This is a great way to get an intuitive handle on the results we discuss.\nCommercial packages of this sort include Maple and Mathematica, but there are also free (even open source!) options, such as gp/PARI.\n\nYou are expected to participate in class. In particular, attendance in this course is\nrequired. More than four unexcused absences may result in you receiving a WF. Keep me posted whenever you have a conflict that requires you to miss class and this should not be an issue.\n\nAll exams are in-class, closed book and closed notes.\n\nHomework will be collected in class, about once each week. Late homework will not be accepted. (If you have a need to turn in HW early, that can be arranged.) Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the term.\n\nOn homework, collaboration is allowed and in fact is very much encouraged. Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently. Keep in mind that by entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA Honor code described in detail at <URL:\n\nIn practice, what this means that you may discuss homework problems and their solutions with your classmates, but you may not turn in a solution unless you understand it yourself. A reasonable rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain your solutions verbally to me (in all their gory detail) if requested to do so.\n\nThe withdrawal policy for this course is that if you withdraw within a week of the date the first midterm is handed back, you automatically qualify for a WP (assuming you are eligible by UGA's standards). After that point, it is at the discretion of the instructor (i.e., me) who will take your performance in the class to-date into account.\n\nBut this is far from the case!

It need not be able to graph or be programmed.\n\nNote that cell phones and laptops are not allowed during exams, so if\nyour only calculator is a calculator program on your cell phone or\nlaptop, you will want to get a stand-alone calculator, or you will not\nhave one during the exams.

I realize that the\nrange of math classes taken by students in math 102 varies widely, and\nthis includes the extent to which students remember various facts.\nThis course, however, is not in sequence with the standard math sequence,\nand so mastery of past math subjects is not as relevant in this class\nas compared to what you might be used to.\n\nMost of the course is based on concepts rather than specific skills,\nthough some skill will come in handy at some points. Though these\ntimes are relatively rare, the strong reaction some students feel when\nthey do not know the relevant skils may make it loom large in their\nminds. Most of these skills, when they come up, are at the\npre-algebra and algebra level: using variables, understanding\nalgebraic expressions, and sometimes solving simple equations. It is\nassumed that students have had exposure to algebra and geometry at\nsome point, but it is not assumed that they have a strong mastery of\neither subject.\n\nIf you find you need some review on some topic like this that is used\nin class, come by my office hours or use the tutoring service mentioned\nabove.\n\nThe Idea of this class: This is most likely a very different kind\nof math class than you have ever had.

This is something\nthat many students don't see in high school courses, or even some\ncollege level courses. Once you see math from this point of view, I\nhope you will be able to see why mathematicians feel that mathematics\nis beautiful, or how creativity, imagination, and logical thinking can\nwork together in mathematics. I hope you will see how mathematics is\npart of what our civilization is all about: where we have been and\nwhere we are going, and why, to be a truly educated person, one must have some\nfacility with mathematics.\n\nGoals: The student should develop:\n\nan ability to approach problems in life analytically.\n\nObjectives: The specific objectives of this course will partly\nbe determined by the students in one of the first assignments.

When you obtain permission to turn in an\nassignment late, we will discuss a new due date for that homework.\n\nComments: You should include comments about the class at the top\nof your homework assignments. These comments can be ``This class is\ngoing too fast'', ``I like this section'', ``This is too easy/hard'',\n``Can we have more connections to music'', ``Everything's\nokay'', and so on. You will not be graded on these comments, but they\nwill affect how I teach the class, and may make the class more\nenjoyable for you.\n\nClass participation: You are expected to actively participate in\nclass. Many students view learning as a passive act, where the\nteacher takes the only active role, and the student simply listens, or\nat most takes notes. This view is not advisable in this class. Here,\nyou will need to take an active role in learning the material. {\\em\nYou} are in charge of your education, and {\\em you} should take\nresponsibility to learn the material as thoroughly as you can.\n\nThis is especially true in this class. As you will discover, this\nclass is not a lecture-style class, where I simply proclaim information\nto you and you record the information in your notes. Rather, we will\nbe engaged in mathematics discovery together.\n\nTen percent of your grade is based on my estimate of your class\nparticipation throughout the term. Mostly this is easy points: you\ndon't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged\nin the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make.\nIn fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this\ncourse, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for\nwaiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.\n\nAttendance: Attendance is important. The whole point of the\nclass is for us to discover mathematics together, and you cannot do\nthat if you are not here. Skipping even a single class will mean you\nwill not likely be able to do the work or know what is happening in\nthe next class period. This is not the sort of class where just\nreading the material in the book will allow you to do the work. And, of\ncourse, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points. In\nshort, skip class at your peril.\n\nExams: There will be three midterms, and one final. Each\nmidterm counts for 16% of your grade, and the final counts for 22%.\nHomework counts for 20% and class participation for 10%. the final\nexam grade will substitute for your lowest midterm grade if this is to\nyour advantage. Borderline grades could go either way, depending on\nthe effort I see you put into the class.\n\nMidterms will be during the normal class period. Both midterms and\nfinal will occur in the normal classroom for the class. Dates for\nthese tests are as follows:\n\nI will hold review sessions before each, at a time that is popular with the\nclass.\n\nGrading: A grade of C indicates an ability to do homework-like\nproblems, and memorization of all techniques and definitions. In\norder to receive a B, a student must demonstrate a deeper knowledge of\nthe material, being able to apply the course material to new\ncircumstances where applicable. An A student must demonstrate this\nkind of deep understanding in all of the covered topics, as well as be\nable to draw new conclusions from known facts in a logical manner, and\nmust also demonstrate persistence and dilligence. In the other\ndirection, a grade of D shows only superficial understanding of the material,\nand shows inconsistency to do straightforward problems. An F\ngrade indicates that the student has severe gaps in even superficial\nunderstanding of the material in the course.\n\nChristian attitude: Although not part of the grading for this\ncourse, you are expected to approach this class with a Christian\nattitude, being willing to help your fellow classmates to understand\nthe material outside of class, being willing to be corrected by your\nfellow classmates when you see they are right, but firm in your\nconviction otherwise, being bold to ask questions without feeling\nashamed of looking foolish, encouraging one another in love, being\npatient with those who are asking questions, and preferring a grasp of\nthe material, which is enduring and becomes part of you, over a grade,\nwhich is transient, external, and shallow. You should diligently\ndevote the time you spend on this class as to the Lord. As cheating\nharms both the cheater and the rest of the class (though in different\nways), you should not cheat, nor should you provide temptations for\nothers to cheat.\n\nFor my part, I commit to approaching this class with a Christian\nattitude, viewing my role as that of a servant, being concerned first\nfor your personal, especially intellectual, development. I\nwill also seek to produce an environment of encouragement and love,\nthat fosters a sense of community and understanding. I commit to reporting\ngrades that accurately and honestly reflect the level of work done in the\nclass, as described in the paragraphs above. I also commit the time I\nspend preparing for this class as to the Lord, and I will pray for all\nindividuals in the class on a regular basis, understanding that even as I\nmay seek to educate, God provides the true transformation.\n\nCalculator: Calculators may come in handy during class or in\nyour homework from time to time, but I will not require you to have\none\n\nIt need not be able to graph or be programmed.\n\nNote that cell phones and laptops are not allowed during exams, so if\nyour only calculator is a calculator program on your cell phone or\nlaptop, you will want to get a stand-alone calculator, or you will not\nhave one during the exams\n\nMost of these skills, when they come up, are at the\npre-algebra and algebra level: using variables, understanding\nalgebraic expressions, and sometimes solving simple equations\n\nOnce you see math from this point of view, I\nhope you will be able to see why mathematicians feel that mathematics\nis beautiful, or how creativity, imagination, and logical thinking can\nwork together in mathematics\n\nStudents\nwill select topics from the book that are of greatest interest to them,\nand the course will be based on what topics are most popular.\n\nThe point is that these subjects are merely a vehicle to introduce the student\nto mathematics: logical thinking, quantitative sense, great and profound\nideas, and creative problem-solving\n\nMostly this is easy points: you\ndon't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged\nin the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make.\nIn fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this\ncourse, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for\nwaiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.\n\nAttendance: Attendance is important\n\nAnd, of\ncourse, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points\n\nBorderline grades could go either way, depending on\nthe effort I see you put into the class.\n\nThere are no make up exams\n\nAn A student must demonstrate this\nkind of deep understanding in all of the covered topics, as well as be\nable to draw new conclusions from known facts in a logical manner, and\nmust also demonstrate persistence and dilligence", "programming_score": 15.932446427148887, "segments_extracted": 34, "original_length": 12553, "compressed_length": 11377}

Three students were invited from every teacher training area; in return they brought exhibition materials about their own education. Special seminars were built into the programme for the exchange of experiences between 170 students from different universities, and between students and the NCM. A Research conference for 130 participants in collaboration with the Swedish Association for Mathematics Education Research, SMDF and NCM started. International researchers from 16 different countries participated and took part later in the biennial. The documentation is produced by SMDF with support from NCM. Ten discussion groups with a total of 500 participants were initiated within chosen problem areas where the possibilities for improvement are considerable. The conference site on the NCM web site will be available. The discussions will hopefully lead to a mapping of the needs of competence development and development work within the respective areas.\n\nStudies at different ages are described - from six-year-olds to trainee teachers\n\nThree students were invited from every teacher training area; in return they brought exhibition materials about their own education\n\nSpecial seminars were built into the programme for the exchange of experiences between 170 students from different universities, and between students and the NCM\n\nInternational researchers from 16 different countries participated and took part later in the biennial\n\nThe documentation is produced by SMDF with support from NCM", "programming_score": 26.23261694058154, "segments_extracted": 7, "original_length": 3164, "compressed_length": 2522}

{"text": "Math anxiety has been defined as a feeling of tension and apprehension that arises when someone is faced with manipulating numbers and solving mathematical problems. It is not just associated with academic settings. It can show its ugly head in many ordinary life situations.\n\nIn academic settings, though, math anxiety can cause students to perform poorly on math tests, homework, and just in class generally. Very often, a studentís poor performance in a mathematics class is not just the result of a lack of knowledge. It can be tied to math anxiety as well. Someone with math anxiety is not mentally deficient. But, it can cause a student to lose focus and to lose confidence in mathematical situations, thus impacting future success in mathematical requirements.\n\nMath is linear in nature. In most classes it is possible to skip one chapter and still understand the other material covered. Not so with mathematics. In this discipline a student must learn and understand a process before moving on to the next one. In other words, what you learn in Chapter One is the foundation of what will be taught in Chapter Two.\n\nRemember, math requires a different mindset. In other classes you may just need to listen, take notes, and then learn the material without really applying what you learned. In math, you will be taking what you have learned and using it to solve equations or a set of problems.\n\nDonít despair! You can do mathematics.

If you must miss a class, ask the instructor if you can attend another section so you can keep up with the work.\n\n4. Try making a vocabulary list or an outline of the material in the chapter. Math does have its own vocabulary, and you need to be familiar with it.\n\n5. Get tutoring as soon as you recognize a problem.\n\n8. Study as soon as possible after your class. If you wait too long, you will forget what was covered in class. Try to make consistent study times at a point during the day when you are alert and focused. Have a set start and stop time and stick to it.\n\n11. Form a study group from your classmates. Make sure you choose students who are motivated and disciplined so you can support each other.\n\n13. If you are frustrated with a concept, stop. Get up. Get some fresh air. Come back to it in a few minutes when your mind is clear.\n\n16. Review your notes and homework before you go into class.

{"text": "Before you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1. Without understanding the distributive property, you will find yourself completely lost in a lot of common situations that come up. The distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nThe Basics of Algebra\n\nBefore you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics\n\nThese basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well\n\nIf you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations\n\nWe need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3\n\nIf you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6\n\nOther times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1\n\nWhile they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky\n\nThe distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nExponents – Just like multiplication is repeated addition, exponents allow us to use a shorthand for repeated multiplication.\n\nPercentages – Having an even ground for comparison between different amounts is a critical skill.", "programming_score": 53.42960288808664, "segments_extracted": 16, "original_length": 2770, "compressed_length": 4392}

{"text": "In the words of the author: Before writing my algebra series, it was painfully apparent that my students couldn't relate to the applications in the course. I was plagued with the question, \"What is this good for?\" To try to bridge that gap, I wrote some labs, which facilitated my students in collecting data, finding models via curve fitting, and using the models to make estimates and predictions. My students really loved working with the current, compelling, and authentic data and experiencing how mathematics truly is useful. My students' response was so strong that I decided to write an algebra series. Little did I know that to realize this goal, I would need to embark on a 15-year challenging journey, but the rewards of hearing such excitement from students and faculty across the country has made it all worthwhile! I'm proud to have played even a small role in raising peoples' respect and enthusiasm for mathematics. I have tried to honor my inspiration: by working with authentic data, students can experience the power of mathematics. A random-sample study at my college suggests that I am achieving this goal. The study concludes that students who used my series were more likely to feel that mathematics would be useful in their lives (P-value 0.0061) as well as their careers (P-value 0.024). In addition to curve fitting, my approach includes other types of meaningful modeling, directed-discovery explorations, conceptual questions, and of course, a large bank of skill problems. The curve-fitting applications serve as a portal for students to see the usefulness of mathematics so that they become fully engaged in the class. Once involved, they are more receptive to all aspects of the course.\n\nI was plagued with the question, \"What is this good for?\" To try to bridge that gap, I wrote some labs, which facilitated my students in collecting data, finding models via curve fitting, and using the models to make estimates and predictions\n\nLittle did I know that to realize this goal, I would need to embark on a 15-year challenging journey, but the rewards of hearing such excitement from students and faculty across the country has made it all worthwhile! I'm proud to have played even a small role in raising peoples' respect and enthusiasm for mathematics", "programming_score": 23.8788584740827, "segments_extracted": 3, "original_length": 1717, "compressed_length": 2282}
{"text": "Why study calculus? Is it because you want to be a doctor, an engineer, a forensic scientist, a biologist, or a mathematician? Or is it because someone told you that it would be \"good for you\"? Well, all of those are certainly legitimate reasons. But if you aren't quite sure \"Why calculus?\" here is another reason: It is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind, and, even more to the point, it is easily accessible to anyone who already has studied algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.\n\nGottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton independently invented Calculus. Although the notation, terminology, and rigor may have changed or been standardized over the years, the concepts that we will study have not changed fundamentally since the work of the co-inventors in the 17th century.\n\nThat calculus is important in real-world applications is not in dispute. In fact, there are so many applications of calculus that studying it really is \"good for you.\" Besides engaging in a worthwhile intellectual endeavor, you will be helping to keep your future career options open. That, from a practical point of view, is not a bad reason at all.\n\nHow to study calculus. Calculus has a lot of rules. We admit it! Find the derivative of this function, or the integral of that. However, you should train yourself to keep the rules in perspective: Always put the concepts first. When you study a given calculus concept, ask yourself three questions:\n\nThe above is what we might call \"high-level thinking.\" It provides a way for you to stay oriented, to know what you are learning, and for what purpose. The rest is in the details, important though they are. The combined process is a lot like using a map to hike through the woods. Yes, you have to look at individual trees and their proximity to local landmarks to find your way, but you always want to keep the map and a compass handy to give an overview of the whole trip. So it goes with the study of calculus concepts. Always know where you are going, the direction to take to get there, and how to accomplish the task. The proof, though, is in getting there!\n\nUsing Calculus on Demand to study calculus.\n\nThe Index page of COD (i.e., the page you see when you go to the web site with your Browser) has a picture of a Leibniz Wheel in the upper left-hand corner. Click on the Leibniz Wheel to find out what it is, and how it represents our philosophy of combining theory with practice in the study of calculus in a computing environment.\n\nCOD is a Calculus I course that gives an introduction to differential and integral Calculus that comprises roughly to the AB part of the AP exam. You will find the topics listed in the green left-hand sidebar of the COD index page. Clicking on a topic will take you to the Lecture-page on that topic.\n\nLecture pages: All the Lecture pages have the same layout. There is a short statement of the main thrust of the lecture, followed by these items:\n\nQuick Question: This section is intended to get you thinking about the topic. Sometimes you can answer this question before studying the material of the Lecture, other times not. If you have answered the question, you can check its correctness by clicking Answer. If you don't think you know the answer to the Quick Question, it is better to wait and try the question again after you have studied the Textbook section, which should allow you to answer the question. As before you then can check the correctness of your answer by clicking Answer.\n\nTextbook: Here you will find a link to on-line material from a textbook. At present, we are using the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. When you click on the topic in the Textbook section of the Lecture page, you will get a list of the material from the sections of this book corresponding to the COD topics. If you click a topic, you will launch an Acrobat Reader pdf file that will display the text on-line. You can open the link for the Lecture you are working on or for any other topic if there is something you have forgotten and want to review, or if you want to peek ahead. The textbook material will open in a separate window so that you can leave it open on your desktop while you are going through the rest of the lecture.\n\nToday's Homework: The link here will take you to the WeBWorK login page. If you do not have a password, you can sign in as a practice user with practice1 as both the user name and password. If \"practice1\" is in use, try practice2, or practice3, etc. until you find one that is not in use. After logging in, you will see a page that has the option to \"Begin Problem Sets.\" After selecting it, you will see a list of homework sets that are listed by day. For example, the homework set \"Setm3f02day04\" corresponds to the homework for COD Lecture 4. Similarly, \"Setm3f02day13\" is the homework for COD Lecture 13. Ignore the fact that the sets all say \"CLOSED;\" this just means that the answers are available, and that WeBWorK will not retain your answer once you log off. However, by choosing a problem set and \"getting a problem\" you may input your answers and WeBWorK will tell you if you are right or wrong. You could also get a copy of the problem set (in pdf).\n\nYou may not want to do the homework until you have looked at some Examples and tried the on-line Quiz. This will be true if you are studying the material for the first time. In that case, you should look at the Examples, take the Quiz, and review the Textbook material as necessary before turning to the homework exercises. For those students who have seen the material before, there is nothing wrong with going directly to the homework. You can always come back later to the examples and quiz as needed.\n\nApplets: These carry out little computer programs that illustrate a calculus idea or provide a tool to implement a calculus procedure. Look at and experiment with them. They are meant to help you learn the material better, or to function much like advanced calculators. Don't be shy. Have fun with them.\n\nThere is also a link to past Math 3 exams (covering Lectures 1-10, 11-19; and the course final). This link is called Practice Exams and should be used as such to test your understanding of blocks of the COD Lectures. There is also a Textbook Home Page link to the home page of the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. Here you will find section-pages that give links to calculus resources on the World Wide Web. And finally, there is a link to the Post a Comment page that we discuss below.\n\nWhat do you do if you have a problem? If you are studying calculus in a classroom setting, you can talk to other students or to the teacher. However, if you are studying on your own, you can Post a Comment using the bottom link on the green sidebar of a lecture-page. There you can communicate with other students who also are studying calculus on-line. You could either state your problem and ask for help, or you may find that someone has already answered that or a similar question. You may even find questions that you can answer for other students. We encourage you to look at the Post a Comment section of COD on a regular basis.\n\nThat, from a practical point of view, is not a bad reason at all.\n\nMoreover, studying calculus can be a lot of fun, but we will let you be the judge of that.\n\nHow to study calculus\n\nHowever, you should train yourself to keep the rules in perspective: Always put the concepts first\n\nThe combined process is a lot like using a map to hike through the woods\n\nAlways know where you are going, the direction to take to get there, and how to accomplish the task\n\nYou have to do it to learn it, to make it your own.\n\nUsing Calculus on Demand to study calculus.\n\nThe Index page of COD (i.e., the page you see when you go to the web site with your Browser) has a picture of a Leibniz Wheel in the upper left-hand corner\n\nThere is a short statement of the main thrust of the lecture, followed by these items:\n\nQuick Question: This section is intended to get you thinking about the topic\n\nAs before you then can check the correctness of your answer by clicking Answer.\n\nTextbook: Here you will find a link to on-line material from a textbook\n\nAt present, we are using the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr\n\nWhen you click on the topic in the Textbook section of the Lecture page, you will get a list of the material from the sections of this book corresponding to the COD topics\n\nYou could also get a copy of the problem set (in pdf).\n\nYou may not want to do the homework until you have looked at some Examples and tried the on-line Quiz\n\nAnd finally, there is a link to the Post a Comment page that we discuss below.\n\nWhat do you do if you have a problem?

In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. The book should be welcomed by graduate students and researchers in a variety of mathematical fields both as an advanced text and as a modern reference work.

{"text": "In Spain, it is well known that secondary school students' motivation to study Science (especially Mathematics) is not very strong. This is a common problem to almost all Europe. Spanish and Andalusian governments have general policies on education to promote the study of Science. They are necessary and convenient. However, we think that local actions in the students' environment, which supplement these policies, are also needed.\nFor this reason, five years ago we founded at the University of Almería an online free journal called Boletín de la Titulación de Matemáticas de la UAL ( mainly addressed to those students. Our intention is to stimulate their interest in mathematics, to develop their mathematical skills, to complement their background, and to improve their perception and assessment of mathematics. Many aspects, usually out of the syllabus, are treated to provide a closer, more real and positive image of mathematics. Another aim is to encourage a closer contact between secondary schools and our university. Although these are our main goals, we do not discard a broader audience and often include articles appropriate for a general public.\nIt is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc. We do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country.\nBoletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world.\nThis project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system. There are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools. The secondary school students are, as said, the main target of this project, and they can participate through the mathematical contest that we pose. There exists a closer contact later in the prize award ceremony at the winner's secondary school. In such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers. No doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience. Regarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called \"Territorio Estudiante\" (Student Area).\nThe journal is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course (October, January and April). Its length is around 20-25 pages and papers published must be short and suitable for a secondary school level. It is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:\n\nFrom Secondary School to University, containing teaching experiences, learning Maths in a foreign language, solutions to the university entrance exam Maths problems, etc.\n\nThe editorial committee consists of 3 main editors and 29 section editors, composed by professors of the University of Almería and teachers from secondary schools of our province, and 4 undergraduate students in charge of the student area. Although our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province. For example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues.\nTo spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes.\nSeveral facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect. We are very interested in knowing if our efforts to bring the Mathematics closer to young people and teachers in schools are useful. Among the methods to know this we use:\n\nNumber of visits that we pay to secondary schools and feedback from them since this quantity points out the interest that the Boletín arouses.\n\nIn conclusion, with the invaluable help of our journal we have set up a reliable atmosphere between professors from our university and teachers from secondary schools in our region of influence. This has permitted to develop other activities jointly such as meetings about mathematical education (I Jornada del Profesorado de Almería,  or the group Almería Matemática in Facebook. Our Maths students at the university benefited from this and there is a growing interest among secondary school students in studying the degree in Mathematics at the University of Almería.\n\nWe do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country.\nBoletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world.\nThis project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system\n\nThere are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools\n\nIn such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers\n\nNo doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience\n\nIt is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:\n\nInterviews, mathematical activities, and news.\n\nFrom Secondary School to University, containing teaching experiences, learning Maths in a foreign language, solutions to the university entrance exam Maths problems, etc.\n\nA mathematical contest for secondary school students.\n\nMathematical spreading, including short articles about History of Mathematics, applications of Mathematics, Women and Mathematics, Culture and Mathematics, etc\n\nMathematical quotations and puzzles are also included.\n\nStudent area, made itself by our undergraduate students and where, among other things, they speak about their experiences with mathematical studies and activities and interview Erasmus students and alumni.\n\nThe editorial committee consists of 3 main editors and 29 section editors, composed by professors of the University of Almería and teachers from secondary schools of our province, and 4 undergraduate students in charge of the student area\n\nAlthough our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province\n\nFor example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues.\nTo spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes.\nSeveral facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect\n\nAmong the methods to know this we use:\n\nAppearance in the local newspapers to achieve more social relevance (see the additional documentation).\n\nNumber of visits that we pay to secondary schools and feedback from them since this quantity points out the interest that the Boletín arouses.\n\nRecognition by the local academic authorities\n\nIn 2011, we received the award for Excellence in Teaching Innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, with the invaluable help of our journal we have set up a reliable atmosphere between professors from our university and teachers from secondary schools in our region of influence\n\nOur Maths students at the university benefited from this and there is a growing interest among secondary school students in studying the degree in Mathematics at the University of Almería.", "programming_score": 31.89546157088661, "segments_extracted": 16, "original_length": 7117, "compressed_length": 8805}

However, since he was largely self taught, leading mathematicians in Paris, such as Cauchy, largely ignored him… Evariste Galois had equally important discoveries. At sixteen, Galois had the desire to enter the most prestigious engineering school of the day, the École Polytechnique… [W]hen Galois submitted a paper to the school as part of the admission process, Cauchy lost the paper.

When specifying the size of a matrix, the number of rows is stated first.

Two matrices of the same size (with the same number of rows and columns) can be added componentwise, that is (A + B)i, j = Ai, j + Bi, j. Matrix multiplication is a little more complicated. A matrix M can be multiplied on the right by another matrix T only if T has the same number of rows as M has columns, and the result will have as many rows as M and as many columns as T. The entry of M T appearing in row i and column j is the sum of the pairwise products of the entries in row i of M and column j of T. In other words, if M is an n by m matrix, T must be an m by l matrix, and\n\nNotice that this operation is not, in general, commutative.

{"text": "The CMP series in both sixth and seventh grade consists of several units, each developing a major mathematical concept through a series of investigations. The problems are designed to allow students to uncover the mathematics that is embedded in the situation. The sixth grade year begins with Prime Time, where students explore number theory and concepts involving factors, multiples, primes, and composites. From there, the first of three units focusing on rational numbers, Bits and Pieces 1, provides opportunities for understanding fractions, decimals and percents. Subsequent units on rational numbers interspersed between other topics deal with operations and applications. Other topics include a geometry unit that promotes reasoning about shapes, as well as properties of these shapes and their angles, as well as a measurement unit that emphasizes area and perimeter relationships of both regular and irregular, curved, and straight-sided figures.\n\nIn seventh grade, the students study pre-algebra, beginning with Variables and Patterns, which is an introduction to algebra, using tables, graphs and symbols as representations. Similarity concepts are developed in Stretching and Shrinking before exploring rate, ratio, proportion, percent, and proportional reasoning in Comparing and Scaling. Through activities from Accentuate the Negative, students develop an understanding and use of integers before Moving Straight Ahead highlights linear relationships expressed in words, tables, graphs, and symbols. The study of volume and 3-D measurement in Filling and Wrapping extends our study of geometry before concluding the year with What do You Expect, a unit on probability.\n\nAlthough those represent some of the mathematical topics for each year, the changes we hope to see in your children go beyond acquiring the fundamentals of algebra.

{"text": "One of the most commonly asked questions in a mathematics classroom is, \"Will I ever use this stuff in real life?\" Some teachers can give a good, convincing answer; others hem and haw and stare at the floor.

The list goes on.\n\nAlgebra is a system of mathematical symbols and rules that are universally understood, no matter what the spoken language. Algebra provides a clear, methodical process that can be followed from beginning to end to solve complex problems.

Volume I covers all undergraduate topics, including groups, rings, modules, Galois theory, polynomials, linear algebra, and associative algebra. 1985 edition.\n\nAn array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. It then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterised by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including new chapters on topics of active interest: symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories, and the coherence theorems for them, as well as 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. [via]\n\n. The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics.\n\nHermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. In The Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, \"My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.\"\n\nWeyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to which The Classical Groups has proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton, Algebraic Theory of Numbers inaugurated the Annals of Mathematics Studies book series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics.\n\nThis is a comprehensive review of commutative algebra, from localization and primary decomposition through dimension theory, homological methods, free resolutions and duality, emphasizing the origins of the ideas and their connections with other parts of mathematics. The book gives a concise treatment of Grobner basis theory and the constructive methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that flow from it. Many exercises included. [via]\n\nThis textbook for advanced courses in group theory focuses on finite groups, with emphasis on the idea of group actions. Early chapters identify important themes and establish the notation used throughout the book, and subsequent chapters explore the normal and arithmetical structures of groups as well as applications. Includes 679 exercises. 1978 edition.\n\nNoted for its expository style and clarity of presentation this substantial revision reflects a new generation of students' changing needs. Proceeds from familiar concepts to the unfamiliar, from the concrete to the abstract. Features a wide variety of interesting contemporary applications which have been extensively revised and updated. Includes new material on least squares and QR-decomposition and greater emphasis on visualization. [via]\n\nFrom the reviews: \"The theory is systematically developed by the axiomatic method that has, since von Neumann, dominated the general approach to linear functional analysis and that achieves here a high degree of lucidity and clarity....The book contains about 350 well placed and instructive problems, which cover a considerable part of the subject. All in all this is an excellent work, of equally high value for both student and teacher.\" --ZENTRALBLATT FÜR MATHEMATIK [via]\n\nGalois theory is a fascinating mixture of classical and modern mathematics, and in fact provided much of the seed from which abstract algebra has grown. It is a showpiece of mathematical unification and of \"technology transfer\" to a range of modern applications.\n\nGalois Theory, Second Edition is a revision of a well-established and popular text. The author's treatment is rigorous, but motivated by discussion and examples. He further lightens the study with entertaining historical notes - including a detailed description of Évariste Galois' turbulent life. The application of the Galois group to the quintic equation stands as a central theme of the book. Other topics include the problems of trisecting the angle, duplicating the cube, squaring the circle, solving cubic and quartic equations, and the construction of regular polygons\n\nFor this edition, the author added an introductory overview, a chapter on the calculation of Galois groups, further clarification of proofs, extra motivating examples, and modified exercises. Photographs from Galois' manuscripts and other illustrations enhance the engaging historical context offered in the first edition.\n\nWritten in a lively, highly readable style while sacrificing nothing to mathematical rigor, Galois Theory remains accessible to intermediate undergraduate students and an outstanding introduction to some of the intriguing concepts of abstract algebra. [via]\n\nThe Study Guide is based on David Lay's many years in the classroom, and has been updated so students can take full advantage of the new projects and data in the Updated Second Edition of the text. This guide gives the worked-out solutions to model problems that correspond with exercises in the text, along with study tips, hints to students, instructions for using MATLAB along with the text, additional MATLAB exercises, and expanded coverage of some text material. Maple and Mathematica appendices have been added, and the TI appendix has been updated to include coverage of the TI-86. [via]\n\nThis text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text. [via]\n\nThis introductory-level linear algebra text is for students who require a clear understanding of key algebraic concepts and their applications in such fields as science, engineering, and computer science. The text utilizes a parallel structure that introduces abstract concepts such as linear transformations, eigenvalues, vector spaces, and orthogonality in tandem with computational skills, thereby demonstrating clear and immediate relations between theory and application.\n\nIntroducing finite-dimensional representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras, this example-oriented book works from representation theory of finite groups, through Lie groups and Lie algrbras to the finite dimensional representations of the classical groups.

{"text": "DESCRIPTION: The unit on graphing linear equations will begin with\nstudents learning to manipulate an equation into slope-intercept form. This will be accomplished through\nclassroom discussion and guided practice from an overhead projector and the chalkboard. Students will then\nhave independent practice with a lesson from their algebra text. Another series of lessons will follow on\ngraphing equations and the various methods of graphing a linear equation.\n\nWorking in groups of three or\nfour, students will each take an equation and create the graphic display for their equation. Then\nstudents will regroup so that one from each original group will now be working with others with the\nsame equation; students will do a peer assessment. Students return to their original group and take\nturns showing their group members how they arrived at their graphic display. All students are to\ncomplete each graphic as it is explained. This is a Spencer Kagan activity entitled, corners. Each\nstudentsí graphics are turned in to the teacher.\n\nUsing graphing calculators\nstudents will extend their investigations of linear equations. Students will draw conclusions about\nslope and y-intercept. The concept of parallel and perpendicular lines will be introduced.\n\nThe computer program Green\nGlobs & Graphing Equations (Sunburst) will be used to reinforce the concept of\nslope-intercept form. The software will be introduced in the classroom with the use of an LCD\nProjector. In a lab setting students will be given 20 levels of lines to identify the equation. For\neach line given, students are to give the equation in slope-intercept form. If a student does not\nget the equation correct, a red line is graphed for his/her equation so that the student can see if\nthey have the slope correct or maybe the intercept is what is wrong. Students are given unlimited\nchances on writing the equation for the line; however, they must get an equation correct for each\nlevel the first time in order to advance to the next level. I have created a record-keeping sheet in\nwhich students keep up with how many times they incorrectly write an equation. After completing the\nlesson, students will then play the game Green Globs in which they are to write an equation\nfor lines that will hit as many globs as possible with one line in order to get points. Students\nbecome very interested in slope and intercepts at this point, and they also become very competitive.\nThe program has a record keeping system for the top ten scores.\n\nUsing the Internet as a\nresource, students will gather data to create a graphic display and experience a real world\napplication of the use of linear equations. Students will be supplied with other possible sites they\nmay visit which will reinforce the algebraic concepts covered in this lesson.\n\nASSESSMENT:\nThe matching of a linear equation with the graphic display. Peer-assessment will occur during the Kagan\nActivity, corners. Self-assessment will be done from the visual display of the overhead calculator. A\nrubric will be used for Green Globs & Graphing Equations tutorial. The Internet lesson and\njournal entry will be assessed by the teacher. Students will also be assessed through out the course on\nthis concept.\n\nI like using the LitePro projector\nto take the students on a virtual field trip in the classroom prior to turning them loose on their own\nwith the computer.

Even though there are many issues surround the using of computer technology in learning mathematics and science, computer technology offers new ways to learn. It helps students to learn based on problem solving. Another advantage is by using computer technology teachers can create inquiry-based mathematics and science classroom. Of course, besides those things, There are many other advantages of using computer technology in learning mathematics and science.\n\nOne of software that I am interested to learn is TinkerPlots. TinkerPlots is software for students in grades 4 through 8. The use of software is to build fluency with data representation and exploration. Animation, color, and dynamic manipulation support students in moving from simple representations to increasingly complex and analytic graphs. Another aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data. TinkerPlots also helps teachers to create inquiry-based mathematics classrooms\n\nSpeech Recognition. Windows 7 has a feature that allows people to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. It is Speech Recognition. We can find this feature on Ease of Access. Before we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer. There are some issues that we have to think about before using Speech Recognition: (1) Speech Recognition needs a good microphone. (2) Training the computer to identify the speaker sounds and pronunciation. (3) Speak clearly and pronounce words carefully, not too fast and or too slow. To open Speech Recognition: (1)Start the Speech Recognition by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking Ease of Access, and then clicking Windows Speech Recognitions. (2)Click microphone button to start the listening mode\n\nBy using Speech Recognition we can do the following things: (1) We can use our voice to control our computer. (2) We can say commands that the computer will respond (3) We can dictate text to the computer.\n\nSpeech Recognition makes a classroom or lesson more Universally Designed. Speech recognition allows students to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. This feature is useful to students with a wide range of disabilities including those with visual, mobility and language impairments. This feature will be very useful in a classroom which the numbers of students with disabilities integrated into it. Today, nearly every class and schoolwork are related to computer. For example statistics class, students will analyze graphical displays of data, including dot plots, stem plots, and histograms, to identify and describe patterns and departures from patterns. In this class they will use computer to create graphical displays. By using Speech recognition and Microsoft excel, students with mobility impairment are still able to participate well in the class. They can input data and command to create a graphic.\n\nSpeech Recognition helps students with mobility and visual impairment. Students with mobility impairments might be unable to use (or be without) arms or fingers to interact with their computers using a standard keyboard or mouse. Using their voice is a way to interact with their computer. By using speech recognition they can operate their computer and compose text. Another is visual impairment, blindness, for example. Students who are blind interact with their computers through keyboards, Braille devices, and audio/voice rather than a traditional monitor and mouse. If they don't have these special devices, they are still able to operate their computer by using Speech Recognition.\n\nConclusion A more accessible technology is good for everyone, including students with disabilities and students without disability. All students benefit from technology in which it is easier to function. Providing accessible technology in the classroom to students with disabilities enables all students to have the same opportunities in education. Speech Recognition gives an easy way to interact with computer not only for students with a disability but also those without a disability. It also helps us to make an inclusive classroom with equal access for all students.\n\nMathematics is my subject domain, during I taught mathematics I used some dynamic geometry software, such as Cabry, Geometer's Sketchpad, GeoGebra and Autograph. These are typically used in the classroom or the computer lab and they are very helpful in teaching the difficult concept.\n\nIt is little bit difficult to find an appropriate technology device in everyday life for teaching and learning the difficult concept of mathematics. Since mathematics concept is completely different from other concepts such as social science, English, etc.Based on my teaching experience in primary school, when I teach a difficult concept, I had to prove the concept and visualized it. these things can be done by using a software for teaching mathematics that requires a certain specification of a computer.\n\nHowever, Nowadays, there is a technology in education known as mobile learning. Mobile Learning is a learning model adopted cellular technology development and mobile phones where this technology can be used as a learning medium. To use this technology, we can download the applications and install them on a mobile phone or use them online by using mobile phone.\n\nMobile learning technology can be used to teach mathematics. One of web sites that provides mobile learning applications for teaching and learning mathematics is  So far, Mobile Learning is very helpful as a supplement material for teaching mathematics. It is easy for students to bring mobile phones wherever they go, this technology will help them to learn mathematics wherever and whenever.\n\nTeachers who want to use it in their classes have to be advanced in using it\n\nEven though the software is not user friendly, it still offers a lot of great features that help student to get success in learning mathematics especially in geometry class.\n\nMonday, March 15, 2010\n\nI reviewed a Mathematics WebQuest\n\nEven though there are many issues surround the using of computer technology in learning mathematics and science, computer technology offers new ways to learn\n\nAnother advantage is by using computer technology teachers can create inquiry-based mathematics and science classroom\n\nOf course, besides those things, There are many other advantages of using computer technology in learning mathematics and science.\n\nOne of software that I am interested to learn is TinkerPlots\n\nAnimation, color, and dynamic manipulation support students in moving from simple representations to increasingly complex and analytic graphs\n\nAnother aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data\n\nBefore we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer\n\nThere are some issues that we have to think about before using Speech Recognition: (1) Speech Recognition needs a good microphone\n\n(2)Click microphone button to start the listening mode\n\nBy using Speech Recognition we can do the following things: (1) We can use our voice to control our computer\n\nFor example statistics class, students will analyze graphical displays of data, including dot plots, stem plots, and histograms, to identify and describe patterns and departures from patterns\n\nBy using Speech recognition and Microsoft excel, students with mobility impairment are still able to participate well in the class\n\nStudents with mobility impairments might be unable to use (or be without) arms or fingers to interact with their computers using a standard keyboard or mouse\n\nUsing their voice is a way to interact with their computer\n\nBy using speech recognition they can operate their computer and compose text\n\nIf they don't have these special devices, they are still able to operate their computer by using Speech Recognition.\n\nConclusion A more accessible technology is good for everyone, including students with disabilities and students without disability\n\nAll students benefit from technology in which it is easier to function\n\nSince mathematics concept is completely different from other concepts such as social science, English, etc.Based on my teaching experience in primary school, when I teach a difficult concept, I had to prove the concept and visualized it\n\nthese things can be done by using a software for teaching mathematics that requires a certain specification of a computer.\n\nHowever, Nowadays, there is a technology in education known as mobile learning\n\nTo use this technology, we can download the applications and install them on a mobile phone or use them online by using mobile phone.\n\nMobile learning technology can be used to teach mathematics", "programming_score": 37.20190779014308, "segments_extracted": 34, "original_length": 9435, "compressed_length": 10191}

{"text": "Let's talk variables. Do we want students to develop an understanding of variable concepts (whether in a developmental math course or not)? Is accurate use of variable notation enough? If students can model applications and accurately determine solutions … is that enough? Is there a role for linguistic literacy in mathematics?\n\nOne of the issues we face in college is dealing (or not) with prior learning. Without intervention, prior learning (even when inaccurate) survives — often surviving in the face of conflicting information in the current learning environment. Visualize the prior learning as being as a stable mass of 'knowledge' (even though it has gaps and errors); as students go through a class as adults, information that connects positively with the old reinforces the old. When new information does not connect or conflicts with the old, the low-energy (natural) response is to build new storage … resulting in that solid core being supplemented by weak veneers of new knowledge. This, of course, is an incomplete visualization for the actual processes in the human brain. The suggestion is that students approach a math class with an attitude that supports old information and minimizes cognitive effort for dealing with new or incompatible information.\n\nIn my beginning algebra class this week, we did the test on exponents and polynomials. Although the test includes some artificially difficult problems with negative exponents, most of the items deal with important ideas. One of the most basic items on the test was this:\n\nNow, this is a good class — all students are actually doing homework and attending class almost every day. We had dealt with the first situation at the start of the semester. How could these errors survive to this point?\n\nI am planning on incorporating some linguistic activities around variables in the first week of the semester. Some of the ideas are from a old book called \"English Skills for Algebra\" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print. The authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students. Some of their activities involve listening to somebody read mathematical statements and the student writing them down. I think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).\n\nI do know that just saying \"that was wrong … this is right\" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding. I need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables. Some energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together. Without that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.\n\n(1) The concept of \"variable\" is a means towards an end. It should thus not be surprising that to \"teach an understanding of variable\" does not work. It cannot.\n\nIn a developmental context, the obvious end is the discussion of function: we need a paper representation for what we input.\n\nThus, my attempt in could not work because, as I eventually realized and mentioned in , I should have had—and will have real soon now—a \"Chapter 3 – Functions\".\n\n(2) The usual definition of powers does not work very well in the remedial situation. For something that works, see freemathtexts.org\n\nThus, 5(3b)^2 should be read as \"5 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 5•3b•3b, and the default rule \"when there is no coefficient, it goes without saying that it is 1″ lets us read (3b)^2 as \"1 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 1•3b•3b.\n\n(3) Re \"linguistic activities\", what is very likely to work is having the mathematics text used as the reading material in a remedial English reading course. Of course, the text cannot be the usual prescriptive stuff (that takes students for idiots) but one that has faith in the ability of the students to be receptive to arguments.\n\nSome of the ideas are from a old book called \"English Skills for Algebra\" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print\n\nThe authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students\n\nI think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).\n\nI do know that just saying \"that was wrong … this is right\" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding\n\nI need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables\n\nSome energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together\n\nWithout that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.\n\nShare this:\n\n5 Comments\n\n(1) The concept of \"variable\" is a means towards an end", "programming_score": 27.83300198807157, "segments_extracted": 18, "original_length": 5030, "compressed_length": 5298}

{"text": "Mathematics majors typically begin their college mathematics studies with three semesters of Calculus. Calculus is both the cornerstone of \"analysis,\" one of the major branches of pure mathematics, and an indispensable tool for most of the sciences and engineering. Students learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right. Students study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.\n\nAll mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year. This basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, \"algebra\" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications. In linear algebra, the study of linear equations, like those in beginning high school algebra -- but with the possibility of thousands of equations in thousands of unknowns -- leads to abstract mathematical spaces.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a variety of more advanced courses. Students decide which of these to take according to their interests and the particular degree which they seek.\nFor example, students apply multivariable calculus in probability and the mathematical foundations of statistical inference in Theory of Statistics. Related choices include Statistical Methods and Introduction to Experimental Designs, in which one learns how to collect and analyze data, for instance in scientific and industrial experiments.\n\nSimilarly, students can choose mathematics courses with special significance in computer science. A prime example is Applied Graph Theory, featuring mathematical models and algorithms applicable to such problems as traffic systems, activity scheduling, and design layout. Others are Cryptography (how to encrypt data securely) and Coding Theory (how to send messages that self-correct transmission errors).\n\nOther courses in applied mathematics emphasize mathematical theory and problem solving methods directed toward the physical sciences and engineering. An illustrative example at the junior level is Partial Differential Equations involving several variables (e.g., both space and time). They describe such phenomena as the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space, and the flow of heat in solids.\n\nCourses in pure mathematics concentrate upon the theoretical foundations of algebra, calculus, and other elementary courses, and at the same time point the way toward more advanced topics in modern mathematics. To illustrate, students in Real Variables (or theoretical advanced calculus) learn why the facts and computational methods learned in ordinary calculus are correct; in Modern Algebra, students study various abstract systems which include the familiar objects of school mathematics as special cases (whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, etc.)\n\nIn addition to taking many courses in the major field of study, every undergraduate at Wright State University is required to take a comprehensive program of General Education studies, including courses in history, English, economics, the sciences, and several other disciplines. Moreover, some degree programs allow students to take \"free electives,\" or courses chosen by students from essentially any area. Wright State's degree programs in mathematics have a generous allotment of these free electives.\n\nStudents learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right\n\nStudents study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.\n\nAll mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year\n\nThis basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, \"algebra\" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications\n\nMoreover, some degree programs allow students to take \"free electives,\" or courses chosen by students from essentially any area", "programming_score": 25.998142989786444, "segments_extracted": 11, "original_length": 4308, "compressed_length": 4555}

{"text": "Matrices are very powerful mathematical tools\napplicable in a wide range of real world problems.\nIntuitively, the main advantage in using matrices is that\nthey allow the logical manipulation of very large sets of\nnumbers at once. More rigorously, they allow the manipulation\n(and solution) of linear equation systems which\nin turn reppresent real world problems.\n\nJust as example, the voltages and currents\nin an electronic board with 1000 components can be described\nby a very huge system of linear equations. 1000 components\nimply 1000 unknown voltages and 1000 unknown currents. Attempting\nto find such a large number of unknown variables without a method\nis substantially a suicide. With the use of matrices such a system\ncan be solved in a very elegant way.\n\nThe horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical\nlines are called columns. A matrix with m rows and\nn columns is called an m-by-n matrix (written mxn)\nand m and n are called its dimensions. The dimensions of a matrix\nare always given with the number of rows first, then the number of columns.\n\nThe entry of a matrix A that lies in the i-th row and the j-th column is called\nthe i,j entry or (i,j)-th entry of A. This is written as ai,j,\naij or A[i,j]. The row is always noted first, then the column.\n\nA special matrix with one of the dimensions set to 1 is called vector.\nA 1xn matrix is called row vector\n\nwhile a mx1 matrix is called column vector.\n\nIf the entries of a matrix are all real numbers then the matrix is said\nto be real. If the entries are complex numbers then\nthe matrix is too said to be complex. If the entries\nare polynomials then (guess what?) the matrix is said to be polynomial too.\n\nThe entries of a matrix usually have some associated meaning but for now\nlet's just say they are mathematical expressions (maybe numbers) and\nconcentrate on matrix manipulation.\n\nWe define the matrix sum as an operation that given\ntwo mxn matrices A,B returns a mxn matrix C with entries that are sums\nof the corresponding entries in A and B. Please note that the sum\nis defined only for matrices of exactly the same dimensions: we say\nthat such matrices are sum-compatible.\n\nWe define the scalar multiplication as an operation\nthat given a mxn matrix A and a scalar expression K returns a mxn matrix B\nwith each entry made of the corresponding entry of A multiplied by K.\n\nIt's again obvious that for sum-compatible matrices A,B and any scalar expression k\n\nand for any matrix A and any couple of scalar expressions\nk1, k2\n\nFood for thoughs: Multiplication by scalar is commutative\nif the underlying ring (of expressions) is commutative. This is true when the expressions\nare (real or complex) numbers or polynomials, that is most real-world cases in that matrices\nare applicable. However, the matrix algebra can be applied also to non commutative rings\n(for example quaternions) where the multiplication by scalar must be splitted in two\ndifferent operations: left multiplication and right multiplication.\n\nWe define the matrix multiplication as an operation\nthat given a mxp matrix A and a pxn matrix B\nreturns a mxn matrix C with element i,j computed\nas the scalar vector product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column\nof B.\n\nNote that the matrix multiplication is well defined only for\ncouples in that the left matrix has the number of columns equal to the\nnumber of rows of the right matrix. We say such two matrices\nto be multiplication-compatible.\n\nFood for thoughs: the multiplication\nof two nxn matrices processes 2 n2\nentries. However there is no known algorithm with computational\ncost of O(n2). Most algorithm\nare O(n3) and the most clever\nimplementations are O(n2.8).\nAn O(n2.376) algorithm has been proposed\nby Coppersmith and Winograd but its implicit factor hidden by the O() notation\nis so big that its implementation is worthwile only if we're going to\nmultiply matrices with n that is out of our current computing possibilities.\n\nWe define the transpose of a mxn matrix A\nas a nxm matrix B obtained from A by swapping rows with columns.\nThe transpose of a matrix A is often written as AT\nor as A'.\n\nFood for thoughs: This property is interesting in computer\nmatrix processing. To apply an algorithm to the transpose of a matrix instead of the original\none we can simply swap the parameters of all the matrix element access functions...\n\nA matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a symmetric matrix;\nthat is, A is symmetric if AT = A. Note that A must be\nsquare to be symmetric and internally the elements must satisfy the relation\naij = aji.\n\nAnd finally taking the transpose of a scalar (1x1 matrix) is a null operation\n\nA particular square matrix that commutes with all other\nmatrices of the same size is the identity matrix.\nThe identity matrix has all unit elements on\nits main diagonal.\n\nGiven a square matrix A we define the inverse matrix of A\nas the matrix that when multiplied by A gives the identity matrix as result.\nThe inverse matrix is usually written as A-1.\n\nFood for thoughs: for non square matrices\nwe can define the left (A-1A=I) and the\nright inverse (AA-1)=I. Such inverses\nhave few real world applications...\n\nfor any invertible matrix A and any non null scalar k.\n\nFinding the inverse of a matrix is a very common highly intensive computational task.\nThere are several algorithms that implement this operation and many of\nthem operate better on matrices with elements that satisfy certain properties\nor conformations.\n\nThe above system of m linear equations in n unknown variables can be rewritten\nby using matrices as follows\n\nThe rows of the A matrix on the left contain the coefficients\nof the linear equations of the system. The unknown variables and\nthe known terms are collected in row vectors x and b.\n\nThe most interesting case is obviously the one with exactly one solution.\nThe Rouche'-Capelli theorem states that for a system of linear equations with\nn unknown variables to be exactly determined there must be at\nleast n linearly independent equations.\nSince more equations are unnecessary then the most interesting\nlinear systems are described by a square coefficient matrix.\n\nBy using trivial manipulations we can now show that by inverting\nthe matrix of coefficients we can solve the system.\nWe multiply boths sides of the system equation by the inverse of A\n\nThe last formula is very important since it provides the\nreal motivation for studying the inverse matrices. If we're\nable to find the inverse of A, we can solve the system.\n\nThe definition of the matrix determinant is quite scary.\nGiven a square nxn matrix A, it's determinant is defined as\n\nwhere E(n) is the set of permutations\nof the numbers {1,2,....n}, P is a single permutation taken out of that set and sgn(P)\nis a function that returns +1 if the permutation P is\neven\nand -1 if the permutation P is odd.\nP(i), then, is the i-th element of the permutation P.\n\nThe Liebniz formula expands then to a sum of two elements\ndictated by the two permutations just described.\nEach element of the sum is a product of n elements\nof the matrix taken from distinct columns. The row of each element\nis choosen by the permutation.\n\nIn the first product we move along the columns (indexed by i)\nfrom left to right and take the first and the second row (null\npermutation). This means a11 and a22.\nSince the permutation used is even, then the sign of this product is positive.\n\nIn the second product we move along the columns\nfrom left to right and take the second and then the first row\n(the odd permutation). This means a21 and a12.\nSince the permutation is odd, then the sign of this product is negative.\n\nThis is rather easy to remember if you note that it's the\nsum of the products of the two diagonals of the 2x2 matrix.\nThe product is positive if the diagonal goes \"up\" from left\nto right while it's negative if the diagonal goes \"down\"\nfrom left to right.\n\nIf you look close you can still spot the same pattern.\nThere are positive diagonal lines that go down from left\nto right and negative diagonal lines that go up\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 4x4 matrices becomes really complex\nand is rarely written explicitly. For larger n values\nthe formula becomes very difficult to use because\nit's hard to enumerate all the permutations of n numbers.\nOther methods for finding the determinant exist\nand later we'll probably spot some of them\nbut now let's look at some of the determinant properties.\n\nIt can be shown that for square matrices A and B, any scalar r\nand the square unit matrix I the following properties are true\n\nConversely, it can be shown that a non-zero determinant\nfor matrix A implies that the inverse of A exists.\nThe proof requires the notion of the rank of a matrix\nwhich we haven't covered so I'm going to omit it here.\nHowever, the two deductions lead us to the following theorem:\n\nMatrices are very powerful mathematical tools\napplicable in a wide range of real world problems.\nIntuitively, the main advantage in using matrices is that\nthey allow the logical manipulation of very large sets of\nnumbers at once\n\nIf the entries\nare polynomials then (guess what?) the matrix is said to be polynomial too.\n\nThe entries of a matrix usually have some associated meaning but for now\nlet's just say they are mathematical expressions (maybe numbers) and\nconcentrate on matrix manipulation.\n\nLet's play with it\n\nWe define the matrix sum as an operation that given\ntwo mxn matrices A,B returns a mxn matrix C with entries that are sums\nof the corresponding entries in A and B\n\nThe (square) matrices for that\n\nare said to commute and must satisfy strict rules\non their elements.\n\nThe non commutativity of the matrix multiplication makes\nthe algebraic manipulation to become non trivial and causes\ninfinite headcaches to engineering students.\n\nHowever, we're lucky since the associative and distributive properties\nstill apply and it can be proven that the following equations are all true\n(given that the matrices involved are multiplication-compatible and\nthe underlying ring is commutative).\n\nTranspose\n\nWe define the transpose of a mxn matrix A\nas a nxm matrix B obtained from A by swapping rows with columns.\nThe transpose of a matrix A is often written as AT\nor as A'.\n\nNote that swapping rows with means effectively swapping\nthe order of indices of each element\n\nNote that the order\nof factors is inverted and the formula is very similar to the one\nthat involves transposition.\n\nFinding the inverse of a matrix is a very common highly intensive computational task.\nThere are several algorithms that implement this operation and many of\nthem operate better on matrices with elements that satisfy certain properties\nor conformations.\n\nThe above system of m linear equations in n unknown variables can be rewritten\nby using matrices as follows\n\nThe rows of the A matrix on the left contain the coefficients\nof the linear equations of the system\n\nThe unknown variables and\nthe known terms are collected in row vectors x and b.\n\nSolving the system means finding the set of values x1,x2,...,xn\nthat satisfy all the equations at the same time.\nIn most cases (if the field of the matrix elements is\ninfinite) exactly one of the following statements is true:\n\nthe system is undetermined (the set of solutions is empty)\n\nthe system is overdetermined (the set of solutions contains infinitely many elements)\n\nthe system is exactly determined (the set of solutions contains contain exactly one element)\n\nThe most interesting case is obviously the one with exactly one solution.\nThe Rouche'-Capelli theorem states that for a system of linear equations with\nn unknown variables to be exactly determined there must be at\nleast n linearly independent equations.\nSince more equations are unnecessary then the most interesting\nlinear systems are described by a square coefficient matrix.\n\nBy using trivial manipulations we can now show that by inverting\nthe matrix of coefficients we can solve the system.\nWe multiply boths sides of the system equation by the inverse of A\n\nSince by definition\n\nso the formula above can be rewritten as\n\nand since\n\nthen trivially\n\nThe last formula is very important since it provides the\nreal motivation for studying the inverse matrices\n\nE(n) obviously contains only\ntwo elements: the trivial \"null\" permutation {1,2} (which is even)\nand the permutation {2,1} (which is odd).\n\nThe Liebniz formula expands then to a sum of two elements\ndictated by the two permutations just described.\nEach element of the sum is a product of n elements\nof the matrix taken from distinct columns\n\nThe row of each element\nis choosen by the permutation.\n\nIn the first product we move along the columns (indexed by i)\nfrom left to right and take the first and the second row (null\npermutation)\n\nThis means a11

remember if you note that it's the\nsum of the products of the two diagonals of the 2x2 matrix.\nThe product is positive if the diagonal goes \"up\" from left\nto right while it's negative if the diagonal goes \"down\"\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 3x3 matrices is more complex\nand it contains 6 elements.\n\nIf you look close you can still spot the same pattern.\nThere are positive diagonal lines that go down from left\nto right and negative diagonal lines that go up\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 4x4 matrices becomes really complex\nand is rarely written explicitly",

{"text": "The \"Manga Guides\" have been very popular and currently the series includes such topics as Biochemistry, Calculus, Databases, Electricity, Electricity, Molecular Biology, Physics, Regression Analysis, Relativity, Statistics, and The Universe. The front of the book includes rave reviews for these earlier books in the series.\n\nEarlier I reviewed the \"Statistics\" and \"Databases\" volumes. I said at the time the Manga Guides appeared to be a \"winning formula\", since the manga story motivated the reader to read on to the next chapter, and the books show empathy for the struggles students experience while learning such topics.\n\nGuide to Linear Algebra – the promise\n\nLet's face it. Most math books are not page-turners for most people. Anything a writer can do to maintain motivation is a good thing.\n\nKeeping with the tradition of the others in the series, The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has a cute story line. Nerdy Reiji takes on the job of tutoring the Hanamichi Hammer's little sister in the topic of Linear Algebra. In return, he can join the Hammer's karate club. In his first meeting with the big brother, Reiji is warned not to fraternize with Misa.\n\nThe manga story continues throughout the book between each slab of math. It works – you want to find out what happens next in the story and with math sandwiched between the manga, it's quite a good concept.\n\nOn the math side, Gaussian Elimination in Japanese is \"Hakidashihou\", or \"Sweeping out\". This is a good way to remember the concept (both for Japanese native speakers and those reading a translation).\n\nHe goes on to explain the main idea using translations of 3-D objects to 2 dimensions (like drawing a building on a piece of paper).\n\nMost people want to know how they will use what they are studying. Misa asks the classic question (p17):\n\nMisa: What exactly is it good for? Outside of academic interest, of course?\n\n… Like it or not, it's just one of those things you've got to know.\n\nI feel the book would have been much stronger if it had been built around such practical examples, rather than concentrating on the (pure) math. Readers could still learn the theoretical concepts as a result of studying such examples. I'm not sure how many university students will be convinced by \"it's just one of those things you've got to know\".\n\nPerhaps I'm being unfair here. Maybe my angst should be directed towards colleges who make topics such as Linear Algebra compulsory because \"it's good for the students\". This may be fine for math majors who have signed up because they love all sorts of math and don't mind what's offered, but for students studying other majors, they really should be given a good idea why they are doing it.\n\nSadly, the book concentrates too much on the calculations involved. Much of this calculation can, and should be done using computers, which then frees up time for everyone to learn the key concepts and how to apply them.\n\nReiji: I think it's be better if we avoided them for now since they might make it harder to understand the really important parts.\n\nExactly! Why even mention complex numbers (here) if they are not going to be used throughout the rest of the book?\n\nThe cofactor method is mentioned on p88, but Reiji says:\n\nReiji: The calculations invovled in cofactor method can very easily become cumbersome, so ignore it as long as you're not expecting it on a test.\n\nFair enough. But after doing an example which involved solving a system of equations, he says (p89):\n\nReiji: Gaussian Elimination is about trying to get this part here [pointing to the right hand side of the working] to approach the identity matrix, not about solving for variables.\n\nPages 98 to 105 contain some really pointless – and complicated – calculation rules. Sarrus' Rule is particularly untidy. I say \"pointless\" because evaluating determinants is exactly the kind of thing we should let computers do. I say \"untidy\" because for non-mathematicians, there are hundreds of steps involved, many patterns to recognize and remember, and way too many places to make a mistake. And in this work, a mistake early on can bubble down through the whole problem. (Yes, students should learn to be accurate and to check their work. But matrix operations are universally disliked because they are tedious, prone to many mistakes and should be done using software in the first place.)\n\nEnlargements & rotations using matrices\n\nArea of parallelogram (p 97) using determinants.\n\nVolume parallelpiped using 3×3 determinant.\n\nI put myself in the latter category. I did enjoy the story!\n\nLet me know if you have bought books in the Manga Guides series and are in any of the above categories. What was your experience learning from the book?\n\nI feel that the Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has missed the mark somewhat. The story line and artwork are very good, but concentrating on the calculation aspects of the math at the expense of the \"big picture\" aspects was a disappointment.\n\nLeave the nitty-gritty of the micro-level math to the conventional textbooks and ensure the reader has the answers to the key what, why and how questions.\n\nCertainly the book attempts to achieve that outcome, however, I was disappointed that some of the opportunities were lost, and some of the messages promulgated by the book are unfortunate.\n\nEarly on, (p15), Misa asks some reasonable questions that most students will ask.\n\nMisa: But I still don't understand… What is linear algebra exactly?\n\nReiji: That's a tough question to answer properly.\n\nMisa: Really? Why?\n\nReiji: Well, it's pretty abstract stuff.\n\nHe goes on to explain the main idea using translations of 3-D objects to 2 dimensions (like drawing a building on a piece of paper).\n\nHowever, his summary would not be understood by most newbie students, I suspect:\n\nReiji: \"Linear algebra is about translating something residing in an m-dimensional space into a corresponding shape in an n-dimensional space.\n\nSay what? (If this was framed in a different way it may have been more convincing\n\nMuch of this calculation can, and should be done using computers, which then frees up time for everyone to learn the key concepts and how to apply them.\n\nIn the story, Misa is not a mathematics major\n\nBut after doing an example which involved solving a system of equations, he says (p89):\n\nReiji: Gaussian Elimination is about trying to get this part here [pointing to the right hand side of the working] to approach the identity matrix, not about solving for variables.\n\nThis would leave many first-time students somewhat unsatisfied and confused\n\nBut matrix operations are universally disliked because they are tedious, prone to many mistakes and should be done using software in the first place.)\n\nHere the message that comes across is \"Math is about calculation\".\n\nShould have more…\n\nThroughout the book there are interesting practical examples, but they are only briefly mentioned\n\nI'd like to see more examples and more space devoted to examples involving:\n\nEnlargements & rotations using matrices\n\nLinear transformations with graphs (e.g\n\np 212)\n\nArea of parallelogram (p 97) using determinants.\n\nVolume parallelpiped using 3×3 determinant.\n\nWho is the audience?\n\nI enjoy the Manga Guides concept, but I wonder how many math teachers would assign this as a text? (I wouldn't, since the math is too calculation-based).\n\nHow many students would buy it?\n\nThe Preface says it's for:\n\nUniversity students about to take linear algebra\n\nThose who've taken it in the past but don't understand it still\n\nHigh school students who are aiming to enter a technical university\n\nAnyone else with a sense of humor and an interest in mathematics!\n\nI put myself in the latter category\n\nWhat was your experience learning from the book?\n\nConclusion\n\nI feel that the Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has missed the mark somewhat", "programming_score": 16.80672268907563, "segments_extracted": 34, "original_length": 9996, "compressed_length": 7820}

{"text": "The geometry presently taught in American high schools includes significant parts of (1) and (2), and some students get an introduction to (3). Transformations (4) make a cameo appearance in many contemporary American high school geometry textbooks, and play a featured role in a few. (5) and (6) have not influenced the high school curriculum.\n\nThe Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, which have now been adopted as a guide for the K–12 mathematics curriculum in 44 states, put transformations in center stage. Students in Grade 8 are introduced to geometry by experimenting with rotations, reflections and translations and they are expected to understand congruence in terms of rigid motions. High-school students develop these ideas more rigorously, learning standard terminology and fundamental facts about rigid motions and dilations of the plane as a foundation for the study of Euclidean geometry. In giving such prominence to transformations, the authors of the Common Core took into account both pedagogical evidence as well as the structure of the mathematics underlying the curriculum. Nonetheless, in view of the traditional organization of the curriculum, this is one of the bolder proposals of the Common Core.\n\nThe challenge will be implementation. We will need K–12 textbooks that are very different from those most widely used. At least as important will be assuring that teachers are intellectually equipped. Good scholarship presented in a form accessible to teachers (or those planning to become teachers) and focused on the meaning and role of transformations in geometry is needed. One would hope to find this in textbooks for junior/senior-level college geometry courses, but unfortunately few books fill the bill. There is no standard undergraduate course in geometry, and the available textbooks have less in common than the books for courses such as abstract algebra or basic analysis that have acquired a canonical form. Geometry textbooks tend either to present some kind of axiomatic treatment and then to branch off into topics or else to be, through and through, a sampling of approaches and ideas. Transformations tend to be treated in college in the same way that they are treated in high school, namely, as an interesting branch of a great tree.\n\nThe purpose of the book of Barker and Howe is to develop the main ideas about geometric transformations of the Euclidean plane and their applications. It could play a valuable role in introducing college students, especially future teachers, to this topic. However, it does not jump immediately to its main topic. Chapter I, which takes up the first 120 pages of the 529 pages of this text, is devoted to a careful development of Euclidean plane geometry based on an axiom system similar to SMSG, which features the Ruler and Protractor Postulates. This opening chapter sets the mathematical tone. It is careful, rigorous, thorough and explicit in its attention to detail. I expect that this would not only be a good book from which learn some geometry, but also a fine introduction to the habits of logical thinking and precise exposition that a math major needs to acquire.\n\nTransformations make their first appearance in Chapter II, which culminates on pages 157–161 by classifying the isometries of the plane according to the number of their fixed points, demonstrating that every isometry is a composite of at most three reflections, and proving that, for any pair of congruent triangles, there is an isometry that takes one to the other. Readers who are familiar with these theorems might wonder if 160 pages of preparation are needed. The main ideas in the proofs are intuitively clear, and can be conveyed vividly by well-designed paper-folding activities. But what a student will take away from an informal presentation is very different from what he or she might acquire by following the course that the book lays out. Paper-folding, whatever legitimate pedagogical purposes it may serve, does not equip learners with a useful language for reasoning about transformations. This book will provide plenty of opportunity to learn good mathematical language and practice its use.\n\nChapter III begins with a discussion of compositions of reflections and the kinds of plane isometries that may be produced, leading up to the classification of isometries as reflections, rotations, translations or glide reflections on page 188. Numerous fine color illustrations make the twenty pages of preparation for this theorem a delightful visual experience. This is followed by a discussion of orientation based on the proposition that the parity of an isometry is well-defined. The chapter then introduces the idea of a group of transformations and in a sequence of exercises beginning on page 203 invites readers to investigate the structure of many examples. The remainder of the chapter deals with factorization in the plane isometry group.\n\nChapter IV concerns similarities. This chapter is especially important for future teachers because of the prominence of similarities in high-school mathematics. The treatment here parallels the treatment of isometries in the previous chapters, building up to the structure and classification theorems.\n\nChapter V studies the conjugacy relation in transformation groups and the decomposition of groups into conjugacy classes. This chapter ends with an interesting but sketchy discussion of the idea of developing geometry from the group of symmetries alone by means of the correspondences between lines and reflections and between points and 180-degree rotations. As a matter of fact, this is an idea that was developed extensively in the early 20th century by German-speaking mathematicians Gerhard Hessenberg, Johannes Hjelmslev and Gerhard Thomsen; see [4]. The standard reference is Friedrich Bachmann's book [1]. Unfortunately, the works of Hessenberg, Hjelmslev and Thomsen have not been translated into English, nor has Bachmann's book. However, a good synopsis in English is contained in chapter 5 of [2].\n\nChapter VI describes applications of transformations to Euclidean plane geometry. Running from page 287 to 346, it includes numerous interesting results. Transformations appear sometimes as essential tools, sometimes as useful aids, sometimes as a way to interpret a construction and sometimes merely as a point of view. Section 2 describes some theorems on the concurrence of special lines in triangles.\n\nThe first theorem on the circumcenter (the point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC) helps to illustrate my remark about the varying role of transformations. The proof is essentially as follows: Let w be the perpendicular bisector of segment AB and let u be the perpendicular bisector of segment BC. Let P be the point of intersection of w and u. Then P is equidistant from A and B because it's on w and also P is equidistant from B and C because it's on u. Therefore, P is equidistant from A and C, so P lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AC. Transformations illuminate the argument — w and u are axes of reflections and it is these reflections that show the congruence of segments AP, BP and CP — but certainly it is not necessary to know this to follow the proof.\n\nThe incenter, centroid and orthocenter are treated in a similar fashion, using arguments in which the role of transformations is clear, illuminating but not essential. Section 3 uses dilation about the centroid by a factor of –2 to unify a discussion of the Euler line and the nine point circle. Here, the transformation does some real work. Section 5 of this chapter concerns the orthocenter (the point of concurrence of the altitudes). The discussion hinges on the analysis of the composition of the reflections whose axes are the sides of a triangle. Here, transformations are not only hard at work, but are leading the development.\n\nI plan to use the text next time I teach the class. I expect to have to pick and choose carefully, especially in the first chapter. I find the level of rigor of Euclid to be a very workable goal in this class. It does not pay off to be overly concerned with facts, such as the Crossbar Theorem, that are evident from the topological properties of diagrams. I think the geometry of the number line is an essential topic, and a good opening for the course. This is consistent with the layout of the book.\n\nMy goal will be to spend only enough time in chapter I to prepare for chapters II, III and IV. These, I want to treat carefully because of the tasks these future high-school teachers will face in the classrooms where they will eventually teach. I shall need to include some material on area and volume, and Chapter IX can support this. Some discussion of coordinates, particularly linear change of coordinates, will be desirable. For this, I shall need to supplement the book. R. Hartshorne has made some observations about conventions related to the Ruler Postulate in a review of this book that appeared recently in the American Mathematical Monthly. Anyone who plans to use the book should be aware of his remarks.\n\nA full review of Continuous Symmetry was written by Robin Hartshorne for the American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 118, Number 6, June 2011, pp. 565–568.

{"text": "The United States is one of the only countries in the world that is teaching courses with names like Algebra I or Algebra II. The rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school. In the United States, some schools offer an alternative, such as an integrated program that incorporates algebra as a strand blended with geometry and other advanced topics. Others continue to offer a course sequence that includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. In an increasing number of states, the study of algebra in some form is required of all students for high school graduation. Regardless of whether a school's secondary curriculum includes a separate course in Algebra I or is more integrated, we can take concrete steps to ensure that students will flourish and succeed when they arrive at the formal study of algebra. A key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.\n\nAlgebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change. Of course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems. But trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure. Algebraic thinking can begin when students begin their study of mathematics.\n\nAt the earliest grades, young children work with patterns. At an early age, children have a natural love of mathematics, and their curiosity is a strong motivator as they try to describe and extend patterns of shapes, colors, sounds, and eventually letters and numbers. And at a young age, children can begin to make generalizations about patterns that seem to be the same or different. This kind of categorizing and generalizing is an important developmental step on the journey toward algebraic thinking.\n\nThroughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well. As students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3. As they explore and understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they can look for patterns that help them learn procedures and facts. Patterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense. Patterns within the multiplication table itself are interesting to children and help them both learn their facts and understand relationships among facts. The process of noticing and exploring patterns sets the stage for looking at more complex relationships, including proportionality, in later grades.\n\nAs students move into the middle grades, their mathematics experience can focus on connecting their work with numbers and operations to more symbolic work with equations and expressions. At this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum. This concept should take students well beyond the study of ratios, proportions, and percent. A real understanding of proportionality allows students to connect their experience with numbers and operations to ideas that they have studied in geometry, measurement, and data analysis. They begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.\n\nA solid understanding of proportionality sets the stage for students to succeed in the more formal study of algebra. From this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally. As students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them. Looking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.\n\nThe development of algebraic thinking is a process, not an event. It is something that can be part of a positive, motivating, enriching school mathematics experience. \"Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School\" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year. Watch for opportunities to develop your own understanding of this important topic throughout the year, including as part of conferences, journals, publications, and the NCTM Web site.\n\nFor this month's questions, consider the following: How can we build algebraic thinking into the pre-K–12 curriculum at all levels? How should secondary school mathematics be organized to capitalize on the inclusion of algebraic thinking throughout the elementary and middle grades? What can NCTM do to support teachers in fostering the development of algebraic thinking?\n\nThe rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school\n\nA key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.\n\nAlgebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change\n\nOf course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems\n\nPatterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense\n\nThey begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.\n\nA solid understanding of proportionality sets the stage for students to succeed in the more formal study of algebra\n\nFrom this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally\n\n\"Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School\" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year", "programming_score": 23.13670081243377, "segments_extracted": 15, "original_length": 5662, "compressed_length": 6391}

{"text": "Get to know your calculator early in any math course. Calculators are used for most routine arithmetic calculations now, and your ability to use a calculator will help to complete work accurately and efficiently.\n\nWhile calculators come in many different makes and model numbers, most of them operate in similar manners. The notes here are specifically intended to assist you in becoming familiar with the Texas Instruments' TI-30X or TI-30Xa, but you should find the same function keys on many other scientific calculator.\n\nDo not worry if there are several keys you don't understand right now. This calculator will serve you well throughout your math courses, even to Calculus and beyond. Anytime you learn some new mathematics, try to learn how to use your calculator to go with it.\n\nKnow how to turn your calculator on and off (the solar model has no OFF; there are no batteries to conserve). Some calculators have an automatic shut off if not used for a few minutes. On the TI-30X, the ON button is the top right key. This is also the All Clear (AC) button, which effectively gives you a clean slate to work with. AC clears the screen to \"0\", clears all memories, and turns off special features (like statistical mode). Use AC only when you want a fresh start. Avoid using AC in the middle of an exercise.\n\nEvery key has a number, operation or function name printed on top of the button. This is the primary function for that key. These are likely the ones you will use most often. The primary functions are grouped, more or less, according to purpose.\n\nThese are the keys for entering numbers digit-by-digit. Use the key for entering a number with a decimal point, like 2.57. Use the key to change the sign of a number from positive to negative, or vice versa. This is most useful for entering negative numbers: simply type in the number, then press to make it negative. It is important to use the negative sign after typing the number, because -0 is just 0.\n\nThese are the basic operations of (from top to bottom) division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. These may be typed in the order written in an exercise, and the calculator will automatically perform the entire calculation according to the required order of operations once the key is pressed. Use the key only at the end of your calculation, and press it exactly once (no more).\n\nAs described earlier, the button clears all previous entries and settings. Use this key when you start, but rarely afterwards. In the middle of calculations, is a better option. Pressed once, this key means \"Clear Error\". Use it to correct an incorrect number as you type during a longer entry. For example, suppose you are trying to calculate 28 (16) + 42, and you typed (but you notice this should have been 16, not 26). Press once to clear just the last number entry. Then type in the correct entry and the rest of the calculation: . You should get the answer 490.\n\nIf you typed well beyond the mistake, then press twice (to activate \"Clear\"). This clears the entire calculation from the screen, so you can start over. For example, in the above calculation, suppose you typed before noticing that the 26 should have been 16. Press and start over: .\n\nOne other option (and a good one), is to make use of the backspace key. This key erases only the last digit typed. Press it once or more to get back to the mistaken digit, and then resume your calculation. Having typed , press the backspace twice, then continue with 16 to get the correct answer. Note that the backspace will only erase digits, not operations.\n\ngives the reciprocal of the number on the screen. Literally, this is 1 divided by x. Mathematically, 1/x is also the same as x-1. On some calculators, the key is . For example, to quickly change 1/200 to a decimal, type . The screen will show 0.005. Likewise, to find 50-1, type to get 0.02.\n\nFinally, the calculator also has a key for doing more general exponents (all three of the above can be done with the exponent key, but they have special easy to use buttons because they are so commonly used). The exponent key is (find it just above the division key). Essentially, pressing this key tells the calculator that the next number you input will be an exponent for the number already on the screen. One nice feature is that the exponent can be any possible number (integer, fraction, decimal, or even another calculation enclosed in parentheses). Always enter the base number first, followed by the exponent key, and then the exponent. Press the key after entering the exponent (or continue the rest of the calculation if there is more). For example, find 210 by typing (the answer is 1024). To compute 0.2-3 type (answer is 125). Note that the negative exponent is entered by typing 3 followed by the key.\n\nThe memory keys allow you to save up to three different numbers for later use. To save the number currently on the display, type . This \"stores\" the value in memory cell 1 (replace with or to use memories 2 or 3, respectively). To \"recall\" a number stored in memory cell 1, use . To try this out, let's compute x2 - 17x + 5, using the memory cell 1 for x when x = -3.217. First enter the number, change the sign to negative, and store it in cell 1 as follows: . Then type in the computation, using for each occurrence of the variable x:\n\nSecondary Functions and the Key.\n\nfinds roots of any index. This is really just the opposite of the exponent key. Enter the number under the radical, press the key, then enter the index of the root. Press if finished, or continue the calculation. To compute , enter . Note that the key changes the meaning of the key to . You should get 12 for the answer.\n\nAbove the fraction key is the improper fraction function . This is nice for converting a mixed number into a pure fraction (although called improper, a single fraction with any numerator and denominator is usually easier to use in algebraic expressions than the equivalent mixed number). In the section on fractions, we did a calculation that gave the answer . This can be converted to a pure fraction by pressing , which activates the secondary function and displays the fraction . Written as a fraction rather than a mixed number, the answer is .\n\nAnother related secondary function is , above the backspace key. The label stands for Fraction-to-Decimal. By pressing this key, any fraction on the displayed will be changed to its decimal form. If the display is a decimal number, the calculator will try to write the number as a fraction, but this is not always possible. So if the decimal number remains, then there is no simple equivalent fraction (remember that the calculator can only do fractions with 3-digit numbers). For example, convert to a decimal just by pressing . You should see 4.6 on the display. Press again to change the answer back to fraction form (you get because the calculator prefers mixed number form). Press to get back to the pure fraction form .\n\nare keys you won't be needing until a College Algebra or Calculus course or beyond. You will learn about the keys for the logarithmic and trigonometric functions later. Most of the secondary function keys are used for probability and statistics.\n\nUse a calculator to compute each of the following. When the answer is a fraction, give the answer in (a) mixed number form and (b) fraction from.\n\nGet to know your calculator early in any math course\n\nAvoid using AC in the middle of an exercise.\n\nAC/ON\n\n2nd\n\nDRG\n\nLOG\n\nLN\n\nCE/C\n\nHYP\n\nSIN\n\nCOS\n\nTAN\n\nyx\n\np\n\n1/x\n\nx2\n\nS\n\n+\n\nEE\n\n(\n\n)\n\n¸\n\nSTO\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n´\n\nRCL\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n-\n\na\n\nb/c\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n+\n\n®\n\n0\n\n.\n\n+/-\n\n=\n\nPrimary functions:\n\nEvery key has a number, operation or function name printed on top of the button\n\nUse the key to change the sign of a number from positive to negative, or vice versa\n\nIt is important to use the negative sign after typing the number, because -0 is just 0.\n\nArithmetic Operations\n\n¸\n\n´\n\n-\n\n+\n\n=\n\nThese are the basic operations of (from top to bottom) division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition\n\nYou should get the answer 490.\n\nIf you typed well beyond the mistake, then press twice (to activate \"Clear\")\n\nThis clears the entire calculation from the screen, so you can start over\n\nPress it once or more to get back to the mistaken digit, and then resume your calculation\n\nHaving typed , press the backspace twice, then continue with 16 to get the correct answer\n\nLikewise, to find 50-1, type to get 0.02.\n\nFinally, the calculator also has a key for doing more general exponents (all three of the above can be done with the exponent key, but they have special easy to use buttons because they are so commonly used)\n\nTo try this out, let's compute x2 - 17x + 5, using the memory cell 1 for x when x = -3.217\n\nThen type in the computation, using for each occurrence of the variable x:\n\nDo not forget to include the \"times\" symbol between \"17\" and \"x\" in the middle term\n\nYou should get 12 for the answer.\n\nAbove the fraction key is the improper fraction function\n\nPress again to change the answer back to fraction form (you get because the calculator prefers mixed number form)\n\nPress to get back to the pure fraction form .\n\nDRG\n\nLOG\n\nLN\n\nHYP\n\nSIN\n\nCOS\n\nTAN\n\nMost everything else\n\nare keys you won't be needing until a College Algebra or Calculus course or beyond", "programming_score": 21.733391992960843, "segments_extracted": 33, "original_length": 11365, "compressed_length": 9293}

[via]\n\nNicholas Lemann's The Big Test starts off as a look at how the SAT became an integral part of the college application process by telling the stories of men like Henry Chauncey and James Bryant Conant of Harvard University, who sought in the 1930s and '40s to expand their student base beyond the offspring of Brahmin alumni. When they went into the public schools of the Midwest to recruit, standardized testing gave them the means to select which lucky students would be deemed most suitable for an Ivy League education. But about a third of the way through the book, Lemann shifts gears and writes about several college students from the late '60s and early '70s. The reasons for the change-up only become clear in the final third, when those same college students, now in their 40s, lead the fight against California's Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot initiative aimed at eliminating affirmative action programs.\n\nDo these two stories really belong together? For all his storytelling abilities--and they are prodigious--Lemann is not entirely persuasive on this point, especially when he identifies the crucial moment in the civil rights era when \"affirmative action evolved as a low-cost patch solution to the enormous problem of improving the lot of American Negroes, who had an ongoing, long-standing tradition of deeply inferior education; at the same time American society was changing so as to make educational performance the basis for individual advancement.\" Lemann's muddled transition is somewhat obscured by frequent digressions (every new character gets a lengthy background introduction), but a crucial point gets lost in the shuffle, only to reappear fleetingly at the conclusion: \"The right fight to be in was the fight to make sure that everybody got a good education,\" Lemann writes, not to continue to prop up a system that creates one set of standards for privileged students and another set for the less privileged. If The Big Test had focused on that issue, where equal opportunity is genuinely at stake, instead of on the roots of standardized testing, where opportunity was explicitly intended only for a chosen few, it would be a substantially different book--one with a story that almost assuredly could be told as engrossingly as the story Lemann chose to tell, but perhaps with a sharper focus. --Ron Hogan[via]\n\nGeorge Thomas' clear precise calculus text with superior applications defined the modern-day calculus course.

[via]\n\nThe development of statistical theory in the past fifty years is faithfully reflected in the history of the late Sir Maurice Kendalls volumes The Advanced Theory of Statistics. The Advanced Theory began life as a two volume work (Volume 1, 1943; Volume 2, 1946) and grew steadily, as a single authored work until the late fifties. At that point Alan Stuart became involved and the Advanced Theory was rewritten in three volumes. When Keith Ord joined in the early eighties, Volume 3 became the largest and plans were developed to expand it into a series of monographs called the Kendall's Library of Statistics which would devote a book to each of the modern developments in statistics. This series is well on the way with 5 titles in print and a further 7 on the way. A new volume on Bayesian Inference was also commissioned from Tony O'Hagan and published in 1994 as Volume 2B of the Advanced Theory. This Volume 2A is therefore the completely updated Volume 2 - Classical Inference and Relationship. A new author, Steven Arnold, was invited to join Keith Ord and they have between them produced a work of the highest quality. References have been updated and material revised throughout. A new chapter on the linear model and least squares estimation has been added.

Its footprints are virtually everywhere - in the spread of forest fires, mass extinctions, traffic jams, earthquakes, stock-market fluctuations, the rise and fall of nations, and even trends in fashion, music and art. Wherever we look, the world is modelled on a simple template: like a steep pile of sand, it is poised on the brink of instability, with avalanches - in events, ideas or whatever - following a universal pattern of change. This remarkable discovery heralds what Mark Buchanan calls the new science of 'ubiquity', a science whose secret lies in the stuff of the everyday world. Combining literary flair with scientific rigour, this enthralling book documents the coming revolution by telling the story of the researchers' exploration of the law, their ingenious work and unexpected insights. Mark Buchanan reveals how the principle of ubiquity will help us to manage, control and predict the future. More controversially, he claims that it may well contain the beginnings of a mathematics of cultural and historical change. Every decade sees a major scientific breakthrough that has implications that go way beyond science. 'Ubiquity' is one of them. This book, the world's first on the topic, will change how we think about the world and our place in it. Chaos Disorder from order. Complexity Complexity from simplicity. UBIQUITY World has a natural 'rhythm': there is a mysterious archetypal organisation that works in the world at all levels and which gives rise to a universal pattern of change - in groups of people, things or ideas.

'A-Z of Medical Statistics' is an essential medical statistics dictionary for non-statisticians, and is therefore an invaluable companion for reading medical literature and critically appraising what is read.Statistics and research methods explained in the book's user-friendly A - Z format allow the reader to locate the information required and avoid the time-consuming process of scanning through whole chapters for relevant information. The book provides clear and succinct explanations of those terms frequently encountered in medical statistics, clarifying their meaning and showing the inter-dependency between various important concepts.

For all his storytelling abilities--and they are prodigious--Lemann is not entirely persuasive on this point, especially when he identifies the crucial moment in the civil rights era when \"affirmative action evolved as a low-cost patch solution to the enormous problem of improving the lot of American Negroes, who had an ongoing, long-standing tradition of deeply inferior education; at the same time American society was changing so as to make educational performance the basis for individual advancement.\" Lemann's muddled transition is somewhat obscured by frequent digressions (every new character gets a lengthy background introduction), but a crucial point gets lost in the shuffle, only to reappear fleetingly at the conclusion: \"The right fight to be in was the fight to make sure that everybody got a good education,\" Lemann writes, not to continue to prop up a system that creates one set of standards for privileged students and another set for the less privileged\n\n[via]\n\nThe Princeton Review realizes that scoring high on the AP Statistics Exam is very different from earning straight As in school\n\nWe dont try to teach you everything there is to know about statisticsonly the strategies and information youll need to get your highest score\n\n[via]\n\nEconometrics has moved from a specialized mathematical description of economics to an applied interpretation based on empirical research techniques - and the modern approach of this innovative book is proof\n\nIt aims to provide a guide to using these methods which will enable applied statisticians to feel comfortable in applying them to data in their own research\n\nA new volume on Bayesian Inference was also commissioned from Tony O'Hagan and published in 1994 as Volume 2B of the Advanced Theory\n\nThe authors describe shared elements in methods for selecting, estimating, checking, and interpreting each model, and show that these regression methods deal with confounding, mediation, and interaction of causal effects in essentially the same wayThis book introduces you to the study of statistics and data analysis by using real data and attention-grabbing examples\n\nThey help you grasp concepts and cement your comprehension by using simple notation-frequently substituting words for symbols\n\nChaos Disorder from order\n\nComplexity Complexity from simplicity", "programming_score": 14.998654829163304, "segments_extracted": 30, "original_length": 14868, "compressed_length": 16863}
{"text": "School mathematics should engage students in real mathematics. This view is at the center of the teaching and learning of mathematics at Cistercian. Every departmental course at Cistercian seeks to engage our students in both formal and informal modes of mathematical reasoning. The journey from arithmetic to calculus begins with Cistercian's Middle School mathematics curriculum. The focus here is first on developing the students' understanding of rational arithmetic and basic geometry. The second two years of the Middle School are considered together as serving the purpose of introducing algebra into the treatment of both arithmetic and geometry.\n\nMathematics in the Upper School begins with Euclid's geometry. Students need to learn geometry, not only because it is indispensable for all of applied mathematics, engineering, architecture, physics, and calculus, but even more importantly because it has simply speaking set the standard that any piece of reasoning must meet to be called a branch of mathematics. Forms VI and VII are a continuation of the earlier forms but the weaving of geometry and algebra is now more complete. Cistercian's mathematics curriculum culminates in Form VIII with a yearlong calculus course taught at the college level with a selection of material which also allows willing students to take the Advanced Placement exams in calculus.\n\nAt the same time, topics from discrete mathematics such as counting and probability are important and are included in each required course. Moreover, students wishing to delve deeper into these topics can take advantage of various mathematics electives in the Upper School as well as join Cistercian's Math Club or one of our many math teams.\n\nDr. Richard T.

{"text": "The College Prep math curriculum focuses on building a strong conceptual base that helps students to become flexible thinkers, able to apply the mathematics they have learned to a rapidly changing world.\n\nMath teachers have designed materials for incremental learning and to address a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Students learn concepts and skills by solving carefully sequenced problems; in class, students often work in cooperative groups. Teachers coordinate courses and review frequently so students retain important ideas from year to year. Instead of separate courses in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, all three areas are addressed in each course of an integrated curriculum. Course materials introduce applications to science and other related fields and provide historical context.\n\nCalculators and computers are important tools of modern mathematics. Teachers instruct students in their appropriate use, but also require a firm grasp of basic skills. Students are required to solve many problems without using calculators. The Math Department uses placement examinations, recommendations, and interviews to ensure that each student enrolls in the most suitable course sequence. Almost all students take four years of mathematics, even though only three are required. Math Club meets regularly to share ideas and investigate problems beyond the scope of the normal curriculum. All interested students are welcome to participate. The club also provides opportunities for students to take part in local and national mathematics competitions.\n\nThis course covers topics from geometry and algebra. The curriculum encourages connections among topics by continually interweaving them. Emphasis is placed on the development of geometric intuition, deductive logic, proof, and a strong foundation in algebra. Group work is encouraged; activities are done in groups, sometimes with physical models and or computers. Class discussions and group activities enrich the learning experience by developing problem-solving and communication skills.\n\nThe concept of function serves as a framework for this course. Mathematical modeling (deriving a mathematical expression from real-world data) is introduced, and students do experiments and use graphing calculators to gather information. Students purchase a course-specific graphing calculator and are instructed in its use. Algebraic skills are practiced within the context of solving problems, and geometric interpretations and graphing are emphasized. Students continue the study of linear and quadratic equations begun in Math I and Math II, adding new functions to their repertoire: polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms. This course is offered at two levels: Math IlIA and Math III. Both are college preparatory and cover functions and applications. Math IIIA is accelerated, covering topics usually included in algebra honors, trigonometry and precalculus. It prepares students for Level IIC of the College Board SAT Subject Test in Mathematics. Math III covers topics normally taught in advanced algebra and trigonometry.\n\nThis course begins with material from pre-calculus, including a study of functions (polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric) and their graphs. It continues with topics in analytic geometry, linear algebra, vectors and discrete mathematics. The course introduces topics from calculus, such as limits, continuity and derivatives and their applications. Students learn the material through lecture, group work, and homework.\n\nThis\ncourse explores topics across a broad spectrum, including pre-calculus,\ncalculus, economics, finance, and statistics. The emphasis will be on\napplications of mathematics to a variety of fields. In the first semester, we\nwill introduce some of the ideas of set theory, statistics (linear regression\nmodels), economics (supply, demand) and finance (including simple and compound\ninterest). Second semester, we will continue with more finance (annuities and\nloan amortization), probability, single variable statistics (normal curve\ndistributions) and calculus (limits, rates of change, derivatives, and\nintegrals). The goal is to expose students to a variety of techniques and\napplications that will be useful in diverse academic pursuits as well as life\nin general.\n\nHow accurate are opinion polls? Where is the economy really heading? Can you believe the latest \"study\" about health and diet? The media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is. In Statistics, we look at how data are gathered and presented, and how certain the conclusions drawn from them are likely to be. This means using standard formulas, but we will also look at the math behind the formulas, including probability and its applications. There are lab exercises (sometimes with edible \"equipment\") and mini-projects in which students design and carry out original investigations. There are also informal discussions of items in the news. This two-semester course is equivalent to a semester of statistics in college and prepares students for the AP exam. It may be taken after or at the same time as Applied Math, or Math Analysis and Introductory Calculus.\n\nThe media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is.

Please read through the information below, keep it available in your binder, and sign and return the tear-off part. 1. Course Description: Geometry is a College-Preparatory course designed to introduce students to rigorous upper level mathematics. Geometric Proofs, logic, inductive and deductive reasoning will be heavily stressed (semester 1), as well as developing and using formulas for geometric shapes. (semester 2) Topics include theorems about lines and angles, triangle results, including congruence and similarity, Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometry, Polygons, Circles, Solids and transformations. 2. Course Outline: 1st semester: chapters 1-6 in textbook, as well as several projects. 2nd semester: chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 7 in textbook, as well as several projects. California Standards for Geometry will be taught throughout the year. See website  for current state standards. 3. Textbook: GEOMETRY by McDougal Littell (blue book) Textbook must be covered, returned in good condition, and cared for while on loan to the student. BRING YOUR BOOK TO CLASS EVERY DAY!!! 4. Grading System: All assignments are expected to be done neatly, on time, and honestly. a. Overall grade is calculated as a weighted average, described below. Homework 10% - must be done completely, with work shown, and turned in on time. Late homework (1 day) will be accepted at half-credit. HOMEWORK IS ASSIGNED FREQUENTLY! Participation 10% - notes, supplies, cooperation, class participation, projects, classwork. Quizzes 30% - Twice a week, usually. Often announced, sometimes unannounced (pop quiz) Tests 50% - All tests will be announced. Passing grade for tests, quizzes and the class is 60%. *************************************************************************** * To be eligible to take the chapter tests, a student must have all homework turned in * * before the test day. Any student who chooses to avoid his/her homework will be * * expected to complete their homework during the test, and MAKE UP THE TEST DURING * * BARK PERIOD. * *************************************************************************** b. Calculation of overall grade 95% - 100% = A+ 75% - 79% = C+ 90% - 94% = A 70% - 74% = C 85% - 90% = B+ 65% - 69% = D+ - avoid this!! 80% - 84 % = B 60% - 64% = D - avoid this!! Below 60% is failing, and will receive an F c. Make-up work for EXCUSED absences - must be done within a \"reasonable\" amount of time - Typically, one day of make-up time for each day of absence. It is the student's responsibility to get any missed notes from a classmate. Missed exams or quizzes must be made up within one week. The student is expected to pursue and complete all missing assignments. Those not made up within the stated time frame will receive a score of Zero. d. ZANGLE and Student Connect. I post grades regularly on Zangle – usually within a week. e. Cheating Policy (VUSD) A student who attempts to or gains an unfair advantage over any other student because of unacceptable behavior is subject to the following: Level One - zero on the assignment or test, conference with the student, contact the parent and send copy of form B to both parent and the Assistant Principal Level Two - zero on the assignment, 2 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Three - zero on the assignment, 5 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Four – Student shall be transferred from the high school and placed in alternative placement 5. Rules and Expectations. My rules are fairly simple – RESPECT for all - This means treat others how you wish to be treated. Use appropriate language and tone. Respect property – DO YOUR BEST. What you get from this class depends largely on what you put into it! – SEEK RESOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS - don't ignore them, they could get worse. – FOLLOW CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS Students will be expected to · Be in their seatwhen the tardy bell rings, with BOOK, supplies, ready to begin · Participate in all class work. Stay focused. · Pay attention, take notes during instruction, and ask questions · Keep all electronic distractions in their backpacks. CD players, video games and cell phones will be turned over to their administrator if used during class · Stay in assigned seat until dismissed. -TARDY It is important to be on time and prepared for class when the bell rings. I keep track of tardy arrivals; you will be expected to serve a class detention for your tardies. 6. Consequences Failure to meet the above rules and expectations will result in disciplinary action, according to school policy.

{"text": "At least, he's taking the same course I took in 9th grade lo these many years ago. IIRC\n\nThese days I think pre-algebra is simply Year One in a 3-year Algebra Spiral. You teach Algebra 1 in 6th grade, calling it Pre-Algebra; then you teach Algebra 1 again in 7th grade; then you teach it again in 8th.\n\nFor the slow track you start teaching Algebra 1 in 7th or 8th, calling it Pre-Algebra; then you teach it again for the next two years running.\n\nThat's it — that's all there is to prealgebra from a purely mathematical standpoint. Later, when students progress to Algebra, this basic idea is used to define functions; as algebra continues it becomes increasingly focused on functions. The purpose of prealgebra is to prepare students for variables and functions without actually mentioning them. It is a crucial topic in the middle grades.\n\n*This is the 'grade A' review for SRA Math, the series Irvington abandoned for TRAILBLAZERS, on mathematicallycorrect. There's a dissenting review by David Klein & Jennifer Marple, (pdf file) also on mathematically correct, saying Saxon is better. Speaking of confusion, I had a memory of mathematicallycorrect reporting that Prentice-Hall Pre-Algebra had been adopted by CA; then a week ago I found a page there saying it had been rejected. Apparently I was right the first time. Was it accepted in one cycle & rejected in another? Don't know.\n\nBelow are excerpts from their second article -- on the algebra requirement.\n\nThe whole series is avaailable at  but may require site registration.\n\nJanuary 30, 2006\nTHE VANISHING CLASS\nA Formula for Failure in L.A. Schools\nBy Duke Helfand, Times Staff Writer\n\nEach morning, when Gabriela Ocampo looked up at the chalkboard in her ninth-grade algebra class, her spirits sank.\nGabriela failed that first semester of freshman algebra. She failed again and again — six times in six semesters. And because students in Los Angeles Unified schools must pass algebra to graduate, her hopes for a diploma grew dimmer with each F.\n\nAmong those who repeated the class in the spring, nearly three-quarters flunked again.\n\nDiscouragement, Frustration\n\nBirmingham High in Van Nuys......has a failure rate that's about average for the district. Nearly half the ninth-grade class flunked beginning algebra last year.\n\nLast fall, the school scheduled 17 classes of up to 40 students each for those repeating first-semester algebra.\n\nTeachers complain that they have no time for remediation, that the rapid pace mandated by the district leaves behind students like Tina Norwood, 15, who is failing beginning algebra for the third time.\n\nTina, who says math has mystified her since she first saw fractions in elementary school, spends class time writing in her journal, chatting with friends or snapping pictures of herself with her cellphone.\n\nHer teacher, George Seidel, devoted a class this fall to reviewing equations with a single variable, such as x -- 1 = 36. It's the type of lesson students were supposed to have mastered in fourth grade.\n\n\"I got through a year of Vietnam,\" he said, \"so I tell myself every day I can get through 53 minutes of fifth period…. I don't know if I am making a difference with a single kid.\"\n\nWhether requiring all students to pass algebra is a good idea or not, two things are clear: Schools have not been equipped to teach it, and students have not been equipped to learn it.\n\nSecondary schools have had to rapidly expand algebra classes despite a shortage of credentialed math teachers.\n\nHigh school math instructors, meanwhile, face crowded classes of 40 or more students — some of whom do not know their multiplication tables or how to add fractions or convert percentages into decimals.\n\nBirmingham teacher Steve Kofahl said many students don't understand that X can be an abstract variable in an equation and not just a letter of the alphabet.\n\nAt Cal State Northridge, the largest supplier of new teachers to Los Angeles Unified, 35% of future elementary school instructors earned Ds or Fs in their first college-level math class last year.\n\nSome of these students had already taken remedial classes that reviewed high school algebra and geometry.\n\n\"I give up. I'm not good at math,\" said sophomore Alexa Ganz, 19, who received a D in math last semester even after taking two remedial courses. \"I think I've been more confused this semester than helped.\"\n\nOfficials are considering other costly changes, including reducing the size of algebra classes to 25, launching algebra readiness classes for lagging eighth-graders and creating summer programs for students needing a kick-start before middle school or high school.\nGo figure\n\nA copy of the LAUSD pacing plan for \"Algebra I: Structure and Method\" is included at the end of this letter. It undermines the organization of ideas in this textbook, and it undermines the California Mathematics Framework and Standards. We illustrate with some examples.\n\nThe two year pacing plan for \"Structure and Method\" calls for the quadratic formula together with completing the square of quadratic polynomials (in Chapter 12 of the textbook) to be explained to students before basic factoring techniques for polynomials (in Chapter 5), and before an introduction to radicals, including techniques for simplifying radicals (in Chapter 11). This choice of ordering of topics is so mathematically unsound that it will most likely seriously undermine the ability of LAUSD math teachers to teach algebra in a coherent and meaningful way. It will reduce the learning of algebra to memorizing meaningless formulas without understanding. In the words of the chairman of the Math Department of San Pedro High School (in LAUSD), Richard Wagoner:\n\nTeacher George Seidel left a 25-year law career two years ago, hoping to find fulfillment as a teacher at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. \"I got through a year of Vietnam,\" he says, \"so I tell myself I can get through 53 minutes of period five.... I don't know if I am making a difference with a single kid.\"\n\nOfficials are considering other costly changes, including reducing the size of algebra classes to 25, launching algebra readiness classes for lagging eighth-graders and creating summer programs for students needing a kick-start before middle school or high school. Go figure\n\nI am a homeschooler, so I don't have a dog in this fight, but ISeeing students in these photos who have been academically-abused for the first 8 years of their school lives just floors me. Really, this country doesn't need to worry about terrorist, we are destroying our country from the inside out.\n\nAt our public schools, they use the concepts of developmentally appropriate, full inclusion, and spiraling to justify this approach. They don't want classes/subjects to be filters. However, the filters are delayed until high school so they never see the product of their work. It's easy enough to blame the child, the parent, or society. By eighth grade many kids will decide that they are just not good in math, thereby completely letting the lower schools off the hook. High schools let the lower schools off the hook. They should be yelling and screaming at the lower schools.\n\nI(I'M WRITING COMMENT TO POST AS A KEY WORD SO I CAN FIND THIS AGAIN)\n\nHere are all these teachers AND students saying 'He still counts on his fingers' — how can anyone NOT take seriously the absolute need to learn the procedures and algorithms of elementary math COLD.\n\nMy kindergarten aged son gets embarrassed when he has to resort to counting on his fingers to solve an addition or subtraction problem. You think these kids don't know that thye're not supposed to be counting on their fingers in high school? I'm sure this is all part of the low self-esteem problem you get when you you can't do math.\n\nWhen you're working efficiently at your child's pace, rather than at the pace of the class & the school with its many holidays & moments of lost instructional time, I think it would be easy to get through one Saxon book & two Singapore books each school year K-5 or even K-8.\n\nIF CHRISTOPHER WERE USING SAXON MATH HE'D BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH EASE.\n\nI suppose the crafty teacher could secretly teach elementary math in class instead of algebra. It's not like these kids are in any condition to pass algebra anyway. Of course, thne this teacher looks bad since his students are all failing algebra and some other teacher will get all the glory when they ultimately pass algebra arenBut what is it?\n................\n\n\"Most students who enter my eighth-grade Algebra I or Honors Algebra I classes in September each year are ill-prepared to learn algebra because most of them have not fully mastered arithmetic.

Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\" . . .

Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.\n\nMost texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data.\nAlthough the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.\n\nThe first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis.

Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.\n\nAlthough the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation.\nA First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented.\nDeveloped from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.\n\nThe field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.\n\nR is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields.\nDoing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive.\nA Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.\n\nWILEY-INTERSCIENCE PAPERBACK SERIESFrom the Reviews of History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750\"This is a marvelous book . . .

Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code.\nThe book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming.

There are Terry Tao's\nmaths quizzes, which seem to\nbe very attractive aids to learning pure maths in general (not just\nfor this course). Both Terry\nand Tim\nhave Fields Medals (these are like Nobel\nprizes, but for clever people).\n\nTimetable Here is the\ncourse timetable.\nFor this course, Lectures (and Problem Classes) are at\nTuesday 9:15 University Hall,\nThursday 16:15 University Hall\nand Friday 12:15 (Problem Class) University Hall.\n\nFeedback The best way to get feedback on your progress is via your tutor. Hand-in work by the specified\ntime and date in the relevant 4W level 1 slot. Your tutor will comment on your work, which should be returned\nto you about a week later. It is a crime to go to a tutorial without having tried the problems\non the current sheet. It is also a crime to go to a tutorial without knowing the meaning of every word\nused on the problem sheet (since if you do not understand the words, you will not understand the questions).\nIt is most definitely not a crime to be stuck, confused or bamboozled, and your tutor should be able to help you there.\nDo not ask your tutor to show you how to do the problems. Rather your tutor should help you understand the problems\nwith sufficient insight that you can do some of the problems yourself. Problems come in varying levels of difficulty,\nand it would be an extraordinary student who could regularly do them all.\nWhat do you do if you think I have made an error in lectures, on a question sheet or on a solution sheet? Well, first check if someone else agrees with you. Then if so, send me an e-mail with the relevant information.\n\nLecturer's Lecture Notes These are in my head, and therefore cannot be borrowed. If you miss a lecture or lectures, then borrow a set of notes from a reliable scribe, and copy them up by hand or photocopying machine.\n\nProblem Sheet Solutions Written solutions will be put up at this site\nafter the work has been handed in.\n\nLecture 2 We introduced more notation, including that\nfor intersection and union. We discussed Boole's rules\nat some length, including De Morgan's laws. We began to discuss maps.\nA dark warning was issued against allowing\nthe set\nof all sets to be a set, for Bertrand Russell is waiting for the\nunwary, and will hit you with a\nparadox if\nyou do that. Note the quality of the\nmoustache.\n\nLecture 3 We introduced the identity map on a set, and constant\nmaps. We defined composition of maps, and showed that\ncomposition of maps, where defined, is an associative process.\nWe defined injective, surjective and bijective maps.\nWe proved that each of these last three types of map\nis closed under map composition (Proposition 10).\nHere is Problem Sheet 2,\ndue in on Monday October 17.\n\nLecture 5.\nWe finished the proof mentioned above. We proved that there is a bijection between\nthe natural numbers and the integers. We proved that if S is an infinite subset of\nthe natural numbers, then there is a bijection between S and the natural numbers.\nWe proved that there is a bijection between the set of ordered pairs of natural numbers\nand the natural numbers. We stated (but will not prove) that if A and B are sets, then either\nthere is an injection from A to B, or there is an injection from B to A (or possibly both).\nWe also stated, but will not prove in lectures, the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem, that\nif A and B are sets, and there are injections both from A to B, and from B to A, then\nthere is a bijection between A and B.\nProblem Sheet 3 and\nSheet 2 Solutions.\n\nLecture 6 We defined countability: a set S is countable\nif (and only if) there is an injection f : S → ℕ\nWe proved that the set ℚ of rational numbers is (infinite) countable.\nWe used Cantor's diagonal argument to show that\nthe real interval [0,1/2] is not countable, and so\nℝ is not countable. Note that there was a typo (chalko?) in\nthe diagonal argument. At one point I wrote yi\nwhen I should have written yii.\n\nAt the Problems Class on Friday October 19 2012, a student called Miles\nproposed a better solution to Sheet 2, problem 8(d), than the one\nwhich I had suggested in the solutions sheet.\n\nLecture 8 We started number theory. We defined prime numbers, and proved that there are infinitely many of\nthem. We defined coprimality, and we showed that if m and n are integers and not both 0, then\nthe smallest positive integer g expressible as rm + sn (with integers r and s) is the greatest common divisor of\nm and n, and moreover that every common divisor of m and n will divide g.\nWe stated the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that every positive integer greater than 1\nis the product of prime numbers in a (more or less) unique way. We got as far as proving the existence of\nsuch a factorization, and will address uniqueness in the lecture on Thursday.\nThis note addresses\nthe chalko in Euclid's proof, and the matter of good housekeeping (induction) as promised in the\nlecture.\nHere are Sheet 3 Solutions.\n\nLecture 9 We completed the proof of Gauss's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nWe discussed how to\ncount the number of divisors of a natural number by\nlooking at its factorization into prime numbers. We compared the prime factorization of positive\nintegers m and n with their prime factorizations.\nWe discussed Euclid's algorithm, why it terminates, and why it gives the gcd of two positive integers as the output.\nHere is a question which has a nice answer: \"what is the sum of the divisors of 1000?\". You can do it in your head\n(provided that you are relaxed about multiplying a three-digit number by a two-digit number, and who isn't?).\n\nLecture 10 We endowed the integers mod n with well-defined\naddition and multiplication. We defined the notion of a group, and gave\nseveral examples. Here are some\nnotes\nwhich will assist you with Sheet 5, Questions 1 and 2 in particular,\nand life in general.\n\nThu Nov 8 Lecture 13 We introduced Euler's φ-function, and proved that it was multiplicative\nwith respect to coprime arguments (by exploiting the Chinese Remainder\nTheorem). We also proved that of f, g are polynomials in K[X]\nwhere K is a field, and g is not the zero polynomial,\nthen there are q, r in K[X] such\nthat f = qg + r and deg r < deg g. There were a couple of\nglitches. (i) In the proof that deg(f + g) ≤\nmax {deg f, deg g}, I wrote\n(al + bl)Xk+l but the exponent should\nbe l rather than k + l.\n(ii) Also in the calculation of φ(pk), the set being subtracted\nshould have been { tp | 0 ≤ t < pk-1} (and\nnot { tp | 0 ≤ t < p}).\n\nTue Nov 20 Lecture 16 More on linear maps and matrices. Small glitch\nin one proof. Fix to follow. How to invert a 2 by 2 real matrix (or indeed, any 2 by 2 matrix\nwith entries in a field). There was a glitch in the lecture, in (iii)\nwhere we were establishing that if the determinant of a real 2 by 2 matrix\nis 0, then it has no inverse. Here is a\nfix.\nHere is Problem Sheet 9Sheet 8 solutions.\n\nThu Dec 6 Lecture 20\nEach element of S_n is either an even permutation or an odd permutation,\nand no permutation is in both categories.

{"text": "Summary: As in the first edition, the purpose of this book is to present an extensive range and depth of topics in discrete mathematics and also work in a theme on how to do proofs. Proofs are introduced in the first chapter and continue throughout the book. Most students taking discrete mathematics are mathematics and computer science majors. Although the necessity of learning to do proofs is obvious for mathematics majors, ...it is also critical for computer science students to think logically. Essentially, a logical bug-free computer program is equivalent to a logical proof. Also, it is assumed in this book that it is easier to use (or at least not misuse) an application if one understands why it works. With few exceptions, the book is self-contained. Concepts are developed mathematically before they are seen in an applied context. Additions and alterations in the second edition: More coverage of proofs, especially in Chapter 1. Added computer science applications, such as a greedy algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph, a recursive algorithm for counting the number of nodes on a binary search tree, or an efficient algorithm for computinga b modnfor very large values ofa, b,andn. An extensive increase in the number of problems in the first eight chapters. More problems are included that involve proofs. Additional material is included on matrices. Inclusion of finite states with output and Turing machines. True-False questions at the end of each chapter. Summary questions at the end of each chapter. A glossary at the end of each chapter. Functions and sequences are introduced earlier (in Chapter 2). Calculus is not required for any of the material in this book. College algebra is adequate for the basic chapters. However, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than do the basic chapters, so calculus is recommended more for giving maturity, than for any direct uses. This book is intended for either a one- or two-term course in discrete mathematics. The first eight chapters of this book provide a foundation in discrete mathematics and would be appropriate for a first-level course for freshmen or sophomores. These chapters are essentially independent, so that the instructor can pick the material he/she wishes to cover. The remainder of the book contains appropriate material for a second course in discrete mathematics. These chapters expand concepts introduced earlier and introduce numerous advanced topics. Topics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings. The range of topics include: Logic--Including truth tables, propositional logic, predicate calculus, circuits, induction, and proofs. Set Theory--Including cardinality of sets, relations, partially ordered sets, congruence relations, graphs, directed graphs, and functions. Algorithms--Including complexity of algorithms, search and sort algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm, Huffman's algorithm, Prim's algorithms, Warshall's algorithm, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithms. Graph Theory--Including directed graphs, Euler cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles and paths, planar graphs, and weighted graphs. Trees--including binary search trees, weighted trees, tree transversal, Huffman's codes, and spanning trees. Combinatorics--including permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion, partitions, generating functions, Catalan numbers, Sterling numbers, Rook Polynomials, derangements, and enumeration of colors. Algebra--Including semigroups, groups, lattices, semilattices, Boolean algebras, rings, fields, integral domains,[\n\nHowever, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than do the basic chapters, so calculus is recommended more for giving maturity, than for any direct uses\n\nTopics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings", "programming_score": 13.312451057165232, "segments_extracted": 3, "original_length": 3831, "compressed_length": 4022}

{"text": "Just because something doesn't teach everything about a subject doesn't make it a poor instructional aid. Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it. Even if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all. (Though if you end up struggling with the harder topics because you didn't have the rules of algebra appropriately memorized, you might never want to study more of it...)\n\nI disagree. I think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with. After all, his goal is to balance an equation, and look, he just balanced it... so what else is there to know ? Thus, the memorization approach creates the impression that math (or whatever subject you're studying) is all about arbitrary rules that make no sense; it's all about \"guessing the teacher's password\", and that's boring.\n\nContrast this with the approach of treating an equation like a puzzle. If \"2x - 3 = 5\", and we want to know what x is, there are many ways to approach the solution. We could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc. Some possible partial answers are, \"someone took away 3, so let's add it back\", or \"if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution\". But \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer. High scores don't mean anything, algebra does.\n\nOf course, this is complicated by the fact that during the process of trying to memorize the rules, I often stop to think about why they work in an attempt to rederive them and make sure I'm not misremembering them. So it's not pure rote memorization, like the way it seems to be with DragonBox. But I would still expect that if somebody first learned them as meaningless rules in the game, and was then later taught math and the reasons for the rules, they'd have a good chance of being delighted at discovering where the rules came from, and could spend all of their cognitive capacity on developing an actual understanding.\n\nFair enough; it's possible that you and I simply think in different ways. I personally find it very difficult to memorize (seemingly) arbitrary rules, and I found it very difficult to un-teach the \"guess the teacher's password\" mentality to people. But it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.\n\nEven if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all\n\nI think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with\n\nWe could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc\n\nBut \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer\n\nBut it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.", "programming_score": 31.631520532741398, "segments_extracted": 10, "original_length": 3604, "compressed_length": 3924}
{"text": "Summary: This chapter covers principles of matrices. After completing this chapter students should be able to: complete matrix operations; solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan method; Solve linear systems using the matrix inverse method and complete application problems.\n\nSolve linear systems using the Gauss-Jordan method.\n\nSolve linear systems using the matrix inverse method.\n\nMultiply a matrix by a scalar.\n\nA matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices are useful in organizing and manipulating large amounts of data. In order to get some idea of what matrices are all about, we will look at the following example.\n\nFine Furniture Company makes chairs and tables at its San Jose, Hayward, and Oakland factories. The total production, in hundreds, from the three factories for the years 1994 and 1995 is listed in the table below.\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to familiarize ourselves with some terms that are associated with matrices. The numbers in a matrix are called the entries or the elements of a matrix. Whenever we talk about a matrix, we need to know the size or the dimension of the matrix. The dimension of a matrix is the number of rows and columns it has. When we say a matrix is a 3 by 4 matrix, we are saying that it has 3 rows and 4 columns. The rows are always mentioned first and the columns second. This means that a\n3×43×4 size 12{3 times 4} {} matrix does not have the same dimension as a\n4×34×3 size 12{4 times 3} {} matrix. A matrix that has the same number of rows as columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with all entries zero is called a zero matrix. A square matrix with 1's along the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else, is called an identity matrix. When a square matrix is multiplied by an identity matrix of same size, the matrix remains the same. A matrix with only one row is called a row matrix or a row vector, and a matrix with only one column is called a column matrix or a column vector. Two matrices are equal if they have the same size and the corresponding entries are equal.\n\nTo multiply a matrix by another is not as easy as the addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication of matrices. Because of its wide use in application problems, it is important that we learn it well. Therefore, we will try to learn the process in a step by step manner. We first begin by finding a product of a row matrix and a column matrix.\n\nIn this chapter, we will be using matrices to solve linear systems. In Section 7, we will be asked to express linear systems as the matrix equation AX=BAX=B size 12{ ital \"AX\"=B} {}, where\nAA size 12{A} {},\nXX size 12{X} {}, and\nBB size 12{B} {} are matrices. The matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} is called the coefficient matrix.\n\nSystems of Linear Equations; Gauss-Jordan Method\n\nIn this section, we learn to solve systems of linear equations using a process called the Gauss-Jordan method. The process begins by first expressing the system as a matrix, and then reducing it to an equivalent system by simple row operations. The process is continued until the solution is obvious from the matrix. The matrix that represents the system is called the augmented matrix, and the arithmetic manipulation that is used to move from a system to a reduced equivalent system is called a row operation.\n\nWe express the above information in matrix form. Since a system is entirely determined by its coefficient matrix and by its matrix of constant terms, the augmented matrix will include only the coefficient matrix and the constant matrix. So the augmented matrix we get is as follows:\n\nOnce a system is expressed as an augmented matrix, the Gauss-Jordan method reduces the system into a series of equivalent systems by employing the row operations. This row reduction continues until the system is expressed in what is called the reduced row echelon form. The reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix has 1's along the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The solution is readily obtained from this form.\n\nThe method is not much different form the algebraic operations we employed in the elimination method in the first chapter. The basic difference is that it is algorithmic in nature, and, therefore, can easily be programmed on a computer.\n\nWe will next solve a system of two equations with two unknowns, using the elimination method, and then show that the method is analogous to the Gauss-Jordan method.\n\nSolve the following system by the elimination method.\n\nNow that we understand how the three row operations work, it is time to introduce the Gauss-Jordan method to solve systems of linear equations.\n\nWe state the Gauss-Jordan method as follows.\n\nRepeat step 5 for row 3, column 3. Continue moving along the main diagonal until you reach the last row, or until the number is zero. The final matrix is called the reduced row-echelon form.\n\nSo far we have made a 1 in the left corner and all other entries zeros in that column. Now we move to the next diagonal entry, row 2, column 2. We need to make this entry(–3) a 1 and make all other entries in this column zeros. To make row 2, column 2 entry a 1, we divide the entire second row by –3.\n\nThe lines intersect in exactly one point. This is called an independent system.\n\nThe lines are parallel, so they do not intersect. This is called an inconsistent system.\n\nIn the Section 4, we used the Gauss-Jordan method to solve systems that had exactly one solution. In this section, we will determine the systems that have no solution, and solve the systems that have infinitely many solutions.\n\nLet us use the Gauss-Jordan method to solve this system. The augmented matrix is as follows.\n\nA few intersection points are listed as follows: (3, 4), (5, 2), (–1, 8), (–6, 13) etc. However, when a system has an infinite number of solutions, the solution is often expressed in the parametric form. This can be accomplished by assigning an arbitrary constant,\ntt size 12{t} {}, to one of the variables, and then solving for the remaining variables. Therefore, if we let\ny=ty=t size 12{y=t} {}, then\nx=7−tx=7−t size 12{x=7 - t} {}. Or we can say all ordered pairs of the form (\n7−t7−t size 12{7 - t} {},\ntt size 12{t} {}) satisfy the given system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, while solving the Gauss-Jordan method, we will get the reduced row-echelon form given below.\n\nThe row of all zeros, can simply be discarded in a manner that it never existed. This leaves us with only one equation but two variables. And whenever there are more variables than the equations, the solution must be expressed in terms of an arbitrary constant, as above. That is,\nx=7−tx=7−t size 12{x=7 - t} {},\ny=ty=t size 12{y=t} {}.\n\nSince the last equation dropped out, we are left with two equations and three variables. This means the system has infinite number of solutions. We express those solutions in the parametric form by letting the last variable\nzz size 12{z} {} equal the parameter\ntt size 12{t} {}.\n\nThe reader should note that particular solutions to the system can be obtained by assigning values to the parameter\ntt size 12{t} {}. For example, if we let\nt=2t=2 size 12{t=2} {}, we have the solution (5, –5, 2).\n\nThis time the last two equations drop out, and we are left with one equation and three variables. Again, there are infinite number of solutions. But this time the answer must be expressed in terms of two arbitrary constants.\n\nIf the reduced row echelon form has fewer equations than the variables and the system is consistent, then the system has an infinite number of solutions. Remember the rows that contain all zeros are dropped.\n\nThe number of arbitrary parameters equals the number of variables minus the number of equations.\n\nAs we look at the two augmented matrices, we notice that the coefficient matrix for both the matrices is the same. Which implies the row operations of the Gauss-Jordan method will also be the same. A great deal of work can be saved if the two right hand columns are grouped together to form one augmented matrix as below.\n\nNow that we know how to find the inverse of a matrix, we will use inverses to solve systems of equations. The method is analogous to solving a simple equation like the one below.\n\nTo solve a linear system, we first write the system in the matrix equation\nAX=BAX=B size 12{ ital \"AX\"=B} {}, where\nAA size 12{A} {} is the coefficient matrix,\nXX size 12{X} {} the matrix of variables, and\nBB size 12{B} {} the matrix of constant terms. We then multiply both sides of this equation by the multiplicative inverse of the matrix\nAA size 12{A} {}.\n\nOnce again, we remind the reader that not every system of equations can be solved by the matrix inverse method. Although the Gauss-Jordan method works for every situation, the matrix inverse method works only in cases where the inverse of the square matrix exists. In such cases the system has a unique solution.\n\nIn this section, we see a use of matrices in encoding and decoding secret messages. There are many techniques used, but we will use a method that first converts the secret message into a string of numbers by arbitrarily assigning a number to each letter of the message. Next we convert this string of numbers into a new set of numbers by multiplying the string by a square matrix of our choice that has an inverse. This new set of numbers represents the coded message. To decode the message, we take the string of coded numbers and multiply it by the inverse of the matrix to get the original string of numbers. Finally, by associating the numbers with their corresponding letters, we obtain the original message.\n\nWe assign the numbers to these letters from the above table, and convert each pair of numbers into\n2×12×1 size 12{2 times 1} {} matrices. In the case where a single letter is left over on the end, a space is added to make it into a pair.\n\nIn the 1930's, Wassily Leontief used matrices to model economic systems. His models, often referred to as the input-output models, divide the economy into sectors where each sector produces goods and services not only for itself but also for other sectors. These sectors are dependent on each other and the total input always equals the total output. In 1973, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this field. In this section we look at both the closed and the open models that he developed.\n\nWe assume that in a village there is a farmer, carpenter, and a tailor, who provide the three essential goods: food, shelter, and clothing. Suppose the farmer himself consumes 40% of the food he produces, and gives 40% to the carpenter, and 20% to the tailor. Thirty percent of the carpenter's production is consumed by himself, 40% by the farmer, and 30% by the carpenter. Fifty percent of the tailor's production is used by himself, 30% by the farmer, and 20% by the tailor. Write the matrix that describes this closed model.\n\nThis matrix is called the input-output matrix. It is important that we read the matrix correctly. For example the entry\nA23A23 size 12{A rSub { size 8{\"23\"} } } {}, the entry in row 2 and column 3, represents the following.\n\nLet us say the farmer gets paid\nxx size 12{x} {} dollars. Let us now look at the farmer's expenses. The farmer uses up 40% of his own production, that is, of the\nxx size 12{x} {} dollars he gets paid, he pays himself\n.40x.40x size 12{ \".\" \"40\"x} {} dollars, he pays\n.40y.40y size 12{ \".\" \"40\"y} {} dollars to the carpenter, and\n.30z.30z size 12{ \".\" \"30\"z} {} to the tailor. Since the expenses equal the wages, we get the following equation.\n\nThe open model is more realistic, as it deals with the economy where sectors of the economy not only satisfy each others needs, but they also satisfy some outside demands. In this case, the outside demands are put on by the consumer. But the basic assumption is still the same; that is, whatever is produced is consumed.\n\nAfter completing this chapter students should be able to: complete matrix operations; solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan method; Solve linear systems using the matrix inverse method and complete application problems.\n\nChapter Overview\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn to:\n\nDo matrix operations.\n\nSolve linear systems using the Gauss-Jordan method.\n\nSolve linear systems using the matrix inverse method.\n\nDo application problems.\n\nIntroduction to Matrices\n\nSection Overview\n\nIn this section you will learn to:\n\nAdd and subtract matrices.\n\nMultiply a matrix by a scalar.\n\nMultiply two matrices.\n\nA matrix is a rectangular array of numbers\n\nIn order to get some idea of what matrices are all about, we will look at the following example.\n\nExample 1\n\nProblem 1\n\nFine Furniture Company makes chairs and tables at its San Jose, Hayward, and Oakland factories\n\nThe total production, in hundreds, from the three factories for the years 1994 and 1995 is listed in the table below.\n\nTable 1\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\nChairs\n\nTables\n\nChairs\n\nTables\n\nSan Jose\n\n30\n\n18\n\n36\n\n20\n\nHayward\n\n20\n\n12\n\n24\n\n18\n\nOakland\n\n16\n\n10\n\n20\n\n12\n\nRepresent the production for the years 1994 and 1995 as the matrices A and B.\n\nFind the difference in sales between the years 1994 and 1995.\n\nThe company predicts that in the year 2000 the production at these factories will double that of the year 1994\n\nWe get\n\nThe product\nFEFE size 12{ ital \"FE\"} {} is not possible because the matrix\nFF size 12{F} {} has two entries in each row, while the matrix\nEE size 12{E} {} has three entries in each column\n\nFurthermore, matrix multiplication is not commutative.\n\nIn this chapter, we will be using matrices to solve linear systems\n\nThe matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} is called the coefficient matrix.\n\nSystems of Linear Equations;

in\nMaple\n\nIntroduction\n\nI\nhave been teaching our second year (Calculus III and IV) for the last 13 of my\n27 years at Saint Joseph's\nCollege.I first became acquainted with\nMaple at one of the very early ICTCM conferences.We first adopted Maple V to use in Calculus\nand other higher level courses.We are\nusing Maple 12 this year and will likely upgrade versions next year.The Calculus III and IV classes meet three\ntimes a week.One of those three\nmeetings is in a computer lab.During\nthe other two class times, we are in a regular classroom equipped with a\ncomputer with Maple, and projection.\n\nThe\nfour primary areas where we have seen advantages in using Maple for our second\nyear calculus are:\n\nComputation:For some concepts, such as tangent and normal\nvectors, computations can be very cumbersome and thus interfere with conceptual\nunderstanding.Maple can remove the drudgery\nof the computations, allowing students to focus on theory, methods, and\napplications.\n\nAssignment\nVerification (Checking Answers):We still want out students to be able to\ncarry out computations(show\nwork!).However,Maple can perform the step by step\ncalculations as well, giving the students a chance to check their work and find\ntheir errors.\n\nIndependent\nExploration and Student Projects:Maple's interface allows students to explore and\nwrite about concepts within the same document.They can easily edittheir Maple\ncommands as well as their accompanying writing.Maple 2D math encourages student to write their mathematics with correct\nmathematical notation.For projects,\nthe interactive style of the software allows students to start by implementing\na scaled-back portion of a project idea, then iteratively expand upon that\nidea.By using Maple's help facilities\nwith instructor's advice and trouble-shooting, students can develop projects\nthat are really fun as well as educational.\n\nAt our annual Saint\nJoseph's College Undergraduate Colloquium, Calculus\nIV students have been presenting their projects in an informal walk-through\n\"poster session\".This format gives them\na chance to explain their work to their peers and appreciative faculty in very\ncreative ways.Traditionally they have\nshown their Maple worksheet interactively along with creative posters or a\nslide show presentation.They often\nhave a fun activity for the attendees.Some of the memorable activities include:\n\nMaple\nis a real power tool, which means it requires an investment of time to learn to\nuse its features effectively.Then -- as\nsoon as one starts to feel comfortable – an upgrade is released with new\nfeatures to master.Some of the helpful\nresources for keeping up are:", "programming_score": 18.415566365531618,

{"text": "Description: This course studies fundamental algebraic systems in mathematics, selected from groups, rings, fields, and modules. Examples of groups include the invertible matrices with a fixed size and the roots of unity. Rings are illustrated by integers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.) Finally, ordinary vectors in space and any lattice in the plane are examples of modules. The concern with these algebraic systems is not simply the study of individual systems, but also of functions between systems which carry one operation into the other. For instance, the determinant not only converts matrices into numbers, but it sends a product of matrices into a product of numbers. The level of attention given to such operation-preserving transformations (putting them on an equal footing with the algebraic systems they transform) is one of the characteristic features of abstract algebra, and also one of the algebraic ideas which have reached into other areas of mathematics. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in MATH 2142(244) or 2710(213). Recommended preparation: MATH 2210Q(227Q) or 2144Q(246Q).

{"text": "Core Abilities (Note: since this course may be taken in partial fulfillment of the general education requirements, this syllabus includes the following set of core ability goals.)\n\nStudents will develop their skills of written mathematical communication, specifically learning to properly use the language and notation of the Calculus\n\nStudents will develop their verbal mathematical communication skills, both in small groups and in class discussions\n\n3. Life Values: Students analyze, evaluate and respond to ethical issues from informed personal, professional, and social value systems.\n\nStudents will see the importance of integrity regarding their own scholarship\n\nSpecific Course Goals:\n\n1. From the perspective of mathematical content, this course should allow the student to expand and apply skills and knowledge gained in the first semester of Calculus to the topics of integration and applications of integration.\n\n5. From a most general perspective, the student should see growth in his/her mathematical maturity. The three-semester sequence of calculus courses form the foundation of any serious study of mathematics or other mathematically-oriented disciplines.\n\nHomework: Let me therefore urge you to make it a regular part of your day to try working the homework problems. There will never be enough time for us to go through every listed problem in class, and it is probably unrealistic to think that you will be able to find the time to work through every listed problem, but you should at least spend some time thinking about virtually every problem, and working the more interesting or challenging to completion. The daily homework assignments will not generally be collected or graded. They are intended to structure your learning so that you regularly challenge yourself to see that you understand the material we are looking at. The important thing is that you at least look at all the assigned problems. You should also feel free to work other problems if you deem it necessary for your comprehension of the content.\n\nYou should view homework assignments as a test to see how well you understand the material and you should bring to the next class any questions you might have.\n\nGroup Work: In general, I think students can benefit greatly by working together on problems. While there is some danger of the \"blind leading the blind\" syndrome, or of students deceiving themselves into thinking they understand the material better than they actually do, for the most part grappling with ideas and trying to explain them to another student or learning to listen to others explain an idea is a wonderful way to see that you really do understand the material. In class we will spend an occasional day working on a group \"lab\", and we sill also typically have a group \"practice exam\" before the individual exams, and I also encourage you to find a \"learning group\" outside of class.\n\nPortfolio: I will be asking you to keep a PORTFOLIO of your work. This portfolio will be collected twice during the semester, once upon our return from our spring break, on Monday 17 March, and again at the end of the course, on Friday 2 May. Each of these portfolios should be a representative collection of your work during that half of the semester; each collection you turn in should include 5 problems, written up in a finished form, along with a brief discussion of why you chose to include that particular problem. These problems should represent work you are proud of, or problems which brought you to a breakthrough point. Each of these portfolios of your work will be worth 40 points, 8 points per problem. Presumably you will hand in 5 sheets of paper, each of which will include a nicely organized solution to the problem, which might be from homework, or from a lab or worksheet, of from an exam, along with that reflection mentioned above.\n\nGrading: I use a rather traditional Grading Scale: A = 90% (or better), AB = 87%, B = 80%, BC = 77%, C = 70%, CD = 67%, D = 60%. I do try to come up with a mix of points so that exams are not weighted too heavily; about two-thirds of the points during the semester will come from individual, in-class exams - the rest will come from group labs, take-home problems, group practice exams, journals, and portfolios.\n\nLate Assignments: It is rarely much of a problem at the level of a calculus course, but it remains important that students turn in work in a timely manner, so that they do not get behind. Consequently, Late Assignments will be penalized 20% of the possible points for each class period late, up to a maximum of three periods. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted.\n\nIf you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services or other accommodations for this class, please see me or Wayne Wojciechowski in MC 320 (796-3085) within 10 days to discuss your accommodation needs.\n\nLife Values: Students analyze, evaluate and respond to ethical issues from informed personal, professional, and social value systems.\n\nStudents will see the importance of integrity regarding their own scholarship\n\n4\n\nFrom the perspective of mathematical content, this course should allow the student to expand and apply skills and knowledge gained in the first semester of Calculus to the topics of integration and applications of integration.\n\n2\n\nFrom a most general perspective, the student should see growth in his/her mathematical maturity\n\nThis portfolio will be collected twice during the semester, once upon our return from our spring break, on Monday 17 March, and again at the end of the course, on Friday 2 May\n\nPresumably you will hand in 5 sheets of paper, each of which will include a nicely organized solution to the problem, which might be from homework, or from a lab or worksheet, of from an exam, along with that reflection mentioned above.\n\nGrading: I use a rather traditional Grading Scale: A = 90% (or better), AB = 87%, B = 80%, BC = 77%, C = 70%, CD = 67%, D = 60%\n\nI do try to come up with a mix of points so that exams are not weighted too heavily; about two-thirds of the points during the semester will come from individual, in-class exams - the rest will come from group labs, take-home problems, group practice exams, journals, and portfolios.\n\nLate Assignments: It is rarely much of a problem at the level of a calculus course, but it remains important that students turn in work in a timely manner, so that they do not get behind\n\nAssignments more than three days late will not be accepted.\n\nAttendance: I do not prefer to quantify your attendance in terms of a grade, but I can assure you that your chances of success will be much improved by regular attendance.\n\nAmericans with Disability Act:\n\nIf you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services or other accommodations for this class, please see me or Wayne Wojciechowski in MC 320 (796-3085) within 10 days to discuss your accommodation needs.", "programming_score": 26.018584703359544, "segments_extracted": 22, "original_length": 6995, "compressed_length": 6943}

This lesson provides a big picture view of the connection between differential and integral calculus and throws in a bit of history, as well. Note: The calculus controversy paper is not included but one can find a number of good resources on the Internet regarding the development of calculus and the role of Newton and Leibnez.\n\nThis video covers the differential notation dy/dx and generalizes the rule for finding the derivative of any polynomial. It also extends the notion of the derivatives covered in the Khan Academy videos, �Calculus Derivatives 2� and �Calculus Derivatives 2.5 (HD).� Note: Additional practice using the power rule for differentiating polynomials (including some with negative exponents) is available to the listener.\n\nThis video is the 4th in a series of videos that explains derivatives. First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.\n\nThis video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.\n\nContinuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions.

{"text": "Category: Math curriculum in general\n\nSome people will be surprised that our Mathematical Literacy course includes some factoring. Over the years, the topic of factoring has been a focal point of conversations — almost with the assumption that a reform math course would not cover any factoring. Sometimes, we go to the extreme view of \"anything not practical right now … will be omitted\", and factoring is usually not very practical.\n\nIn our Mathematical Literacy course we covered factoring last week — true, this is just the GCF (no trinomial methods nor special formulas). Since we only include GCF as a method students have an easier time. However, if we had time, I would not mind if we covered a little more factoring.\n\nFor language skills, it is important that people be able to express thoughts concisely (simplify); in some important situations, it is even more important to be able to express thoughts in a more complex way that maintains the equivalent message — persuasive writing and speaking are particular modes in this style. In a general way, learning (or a process) that can only be used one direction is usually learned only partially. Deeper learning depends upon a variety of experiences with objects or ideas.\n\nOf course, one risk of this work with the GCF is that students get even more confused. We need to be careful that assessments help students understand better; within the Math Lit class, I need more experience designing the class work so better assessments can be delivered to students.\n\nSome related work will also be available at the conference — the Dana Center \"New Mathways Project\" will have sessions. When the mini-program is available, I will post a summary of all reform-related sessions.\n\nA course design can facilitate learning, and a course design can hinder learning. I suspect that we get so focused on the details of our math courses that we may not notice whether our course is facilitating or hindering.\n\nIn our Math Literacy class, we have been working on algebraic reasoning. On the surface, the class looks like we are not 'covering' very much because we don't include some typical algebraic (developmental) topics. We found some hidden treasure this week in class.\n\nAs we often do, part of class is based on groups figuring out problems with some guidance and reflection. Today this meant that we had each group do an equation 'tag-team' style — each student could either do the next step, or erase the last step. Students had a little trouble playing by the rules, and wanted to switch to 'their' method to solve the equation. The payoff came when we talked about the different choices, as more students figured out that they have options for linear equations.\n\nThe hidden treasure came next, not that students saw it as totally good. We looked at how we could solve equations of a type never seen before, starting with a simple rational equation (namely, 5 = 200/x). Students could see the solution (40) though not always obtained formally, so we talked about doing 'opposite' operations to solve. We followed this with a radical equation (the pendulum model), which is not normally seen in this level of math course. To solve for the length inside the radical, we listed the calculation steps if we knew the length and wanted to calculate the period. Then, we reversed — the opposite operations in the reverse order.\n\nTo me, the hidden treasure in this is that students get to think about both types of skills that we use in mathematics — we have routine procedures (often based on properties) and we have reasoning about statements (often based on relationships unique to the problem). Wouldn't it be wonderful if students developed both strategies, instead of just using routine procedures (often memorized)?\n\nOur work with the GCF puts students right in the middle of this confusion; in other words, the GCF is a great opportunity for students to better understand basic algebraic notation.\n\nOf course, one risk of this work with the GCF is that students get even more confused\n\nWhen the mini-program is available, I will post a summary of all reform-related sessions.\n\nShare this:\n\nA course design can facilitate learning, and a course design can hinder learning\n\nI suspect that we get so focused on the details of our math courses that we may not notice whether our course is facilitating or hindering.\n\nIn our Math Literacy class, we have been working on algebraic reasoning\n\nThen, we reversed — the opposite operations in the reverse order.\n\nTo me, the hidden treasure in this is that students get to think about both types of skills that we use in mathematics — we have routine procedures (often based on properties) and we have reasoning about statements (often based on relationships unique to the problem)\n\nWouldn't it be wonderful if students developed both strategies, instead of just using routine procedures (often memorized)?\n\nIt's clear that my hidden treasure was not perfectly clear to students; after this discussion, we had a worksheet which included an equation of related design", "programming_score": 13.305736250739207, "segments_extracted": 16, "original_length": 6764, "compressed_length": 5058}

{"text": "ALEKS Student Access Code: Purchased from the Viterbo Bookstore.\n\nCourse Goals and Student Outcomes:\n\nYour placement score indicated that you have not mastered this content, whatever the reason. To make the best of the situation, your goal here must be to learn this material and master the necessary skills so that you can be successful in the courses you eventually need to take as part of your college program.\n\nALEKS: ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces) is a web-based program designed to carefully assess what students know and what they are ready to learn, and then to methodically tutor them in the given material, in this case Introductory Algebra. After registering, you will begin by going through a brief tutorial on the use of the ALEKS input tool, also called the \"Answer Editor.\" On the second day you will do the Initial Assessment in class.\n\nAnother advantage to using ALEKS is that since it is web-based you can work on your course anywhere you have internet access. ALEKS will remember where you left off and will always make sure that you have shown readiness before presenting new material. However, the Initial Assessment and all Quizzes/Exams must be taken during class.\n\nBe sure to do your own work! Your best preparation for online in-class quizzes is when you have been working with ALEKS yourself. By allowing someone else to do your work for you, the only person you are cheating is yourself.\n\n(5) Attendance/ALEKS time outside of class: Important determination for borderline grades\n\n(1) Check-Offs: You will all receive a packet containing Check-Offs which are basically practice problems for questions covered throughout the course. Think of these as homework problems that need to be turned-in. As you master the topics covered on each Check-Off, complete the questions and submit your packet for review. Each section (A – L) is worth 5 points. The Check-Offs need to be completed during class in order to receive credit.\n\n* For each Quiz, although it will be taken online, you need to turn-in a paper/pencil copy of the questions with your work and answers at the end of the class period during which each Quiz is taken. At the completion of the Quiz, you will receive your score. If you do not pass a Quiz or plan to retake it, do not turn in your work. Study from it - - you are allowed one chance to re-take each quiz.\n\n**REMINDER**These quizzes, even the re-takes, must be taken in the classroom!\n\nA calculator is allowed for all in-class assessments EXCEPT for Quiz #1 .\n\n(3) ALEKS Modules Completed: On the last two days of class you will take a final assessment, triggered by me. The percentage you score on that assessment is the number of points you receive, based out of 100. This assessment must be completed in the classroom. If you do not finish in one class period, you MUST NOT log on to ALEKS again until you return the next day for class, at which time you can complete your assessment. You must leave record with me as to which problem you were on when you leave, and if you are not on that same problem when you return, you must take the assessment again in the Learning Center. You can use your handwritten notes. DO NOT use the text.\n\n(5) Attendance: A major factor in learning mathematics is a regular and focused schedule of practice. You need to practice virtually every day, and for a considerable amount of time each day in order to establish a solid foundation in algebra. To help you work on ALEKS, classroom attendance is REQUIRED every day. I will be keeping track, and will contact you if you miss too many classes. Your attendance will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nALEKS Time: ALEKS keeps track of how much time you have put in as well as how much progress you have made. It is almost impossible to pass the class if you do not spend additional time outside of class on ALEKS. It is suggested that you spend an additional 2 to3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. This commitment will help ensure successful progress through ALEKS. I will be keeping track of your hours spent on ALEKS, and I will contact you if it appears you are not putting in enough time outside of class. Your total number of hours on ALEKS will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nIt is possible that some of you will actually complete the ALEKS course before the calendar indicates the semester is over, and that's fine. I will still have you take the final exam with the rest of the class on the scheduled date. And it is possible that some of you may reach December without completing the material. ALEKS offers a guarantee that if you do not pass the course despite having put in at least 80 hours, your license to use ALEKS can be renewed for a semester at no cost. In this case, you will be given a grade of \"I\" (Incomplete), allowing you to work towards completion of the course during the next semester. Of course, this is far from ideal since it means you could not yet enroll in the course you need to take for your major. Use the Quiz dates as a goal for completion!\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act: If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations for this class, please see me and/or Wayne Wojciechowski, the campus ADA coordinator (MC 335, 796-3085), within ten days to discuss your needs.\n\nYou will need the ALEKS Student Access Code on the back of your ALEKS Users' Guide, purchased from the Bookstore. You will also need the Course Code for your section, which is listed below.\n\nOn the first day of class, each of you will log in and we will examine the basics of using ALEKS. I will ask you to work your way through the \"Answer Editor\" tutorial so that you become familiar with how to enter mathematical expressions for assessments, on-line work and quizzes. Then on the second day of class I will have you take the initial ALEKS assessment to get a baseline rating of your skills and readiness for the material in this course. It is important that you always put forth your best effort when taking assessments, because this is how ALEKS determines whether or not you have mastered the material already learned.\n\nYou must earn at least a \"C\" grade to qualify for the next course in your sequence.\n\nALEKS Student Access Code: Purchased from the Viterbo Bookstore.\n\nYou will also need the appropriate Course Code for your specific section, which is provided later in this document.\n\nThis textbook is published by McGraw-Hill, who also handles ALEKS for institutions of higher education\n\nMy role as instructor here is to monitor your learning and to engage in individual tutoring as the need arises.\n\nAnother advantage to using ALEKS is that since it is web-based you can work on your course anywhere you have internet access\n\nStudy from it - - you are allowed one chance to re-take each quiz.\n\n**REMINDER**These quizzes, even the re-takes, must be taken in the classroom!\n\nA calculator is allowed for all in-class assessments EXCEPT for Quiz #1 .\n\n_______________ __Quiz Schedule: _____________________\n\nDue Date\n\nReview & Chapter 1 January 24, 2007\n\nChapter 2 February 7\n\nChapter 3 February 14\n\nChapter 4 February 21\n\nChapter 5 March 14\nChapter 6 March 21\n\nChapter 7 March 28\n\nChapter 8 April 11\n\nChapter 9 April 18\n\nChapter 10 May 1\n\n(3) ALEKS Modules Completed: On the last two days of class you will take a final assessment, triggered by me\n\nYour attendance will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nALEKS Time: ALEKS keeps track of how much time you have put in as well as how much progress you have made\n\nALEKS offers a guarantee that if you do not pass the course despite having put in at least 80 hours, your license to use ALEKS can be renewed for a semester at no cost\n\nOf course, this is far from ideal since it means you could not yet enroll in the course you need to take for your major\n\nUse the Quiz dates as a goal for completion!\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act: If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations for this class, please see me and/or Wayne Wojciechowski, the campus ADA coordinator (MC 335, 796-3085), within ten days to discuss your needs.\n\nAcademic Honesty: Per University policy (handbook page 131), you are expected to do your own work for this class\n\nIf it is suspected that you violated this policy, you will need to retake the assessment under supervision.\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nTuesday, May 1: Check-Offs Due\n\nWednesday, May 2 & Thursday, May 3: Completion Assessment on ALEKS\n\nFriday, May 11: Course Final\n\nNo Class Meetings:\n\nMonday, March 5 – Thursday, March 8: Spring Break\n\nMonday, April 9: Easter Break\n\nThe policies and outline of this course are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.\n\nRevised 1/9/07\n\nUsing ALEKS\n\nYou will need the ALEKS Student Access Code on the back of your ALEKS Users' Guide, purchased from the Bookstore\n\nAbove the Registered Users box you should click:\n\nNew User?

In contrast, the concept\nof limit and its connection with the other mathematical topics in\nthis standard is based on infinite processes. Thus, explorations\nof the topics proposed here not only extend students' knowledge\nof function characteristics but also introduce them to another mode\nof mathematical thinking.\n\nInstruction should be highly\nexploratory and based on numerical and geometric experiences that\ncapitalize on both calculator and computer technology. Instructional\nactivities should be aimed at providing students with firm conceptual\nunderpinnings of calculus rather than at developing manipulative\ntechniques.\n\nThe development of the\ncalculus represents one of the great intellectual accomplishments\nin human history; perhaps the greatest achievement in the application\nof mathematics is the use of calculus in physics during the first\nthird of this century. Today, methods of calculus are applied increasingly\nin the social and biological sciences, and in business as well.\nAs students explore the topics proposed in this standard, it is\nimportant that they develop an awareness of, and appreciation for,\nthe historical origins and the cultural contributions of the calculus.\n\nAt a somewhat higher but\nstill intuitive level, the series can be summed by investigating\nthe limit of the sequence of partial sums (either by using a calculator\nor a simple looping computer program or by applying the formula\nfor the sum of a finite geometric series). An understanding of the\nconcept of limit in contexts such as this should in turn contribute\nto the meaningful development of the remaining topics in this standard.\n\nSimilarly, it is important\nthat all students recognize how the concept of the area under a\ncurve builds on and extends their previous experiences with areas\nof geometric figures. College-intending students also should recognize\nhow the rate of change builds on and extends their experiences with\nuniform motion and associated rates in algebra and trigonometry,\nand how the slope of a tangent to a curve generalizes the notion\nof the slope of a line as developed in algebra.\n\nNote that correct responses\nmay vary; for example, the distance-time graph could be translated\nvertically.\n\nComputing technology makes\nthe fundamental concepts and applications of calculus accessible\nto all students. The area under a finite portion of a curve, for\nexample, can be approximated geometrically by partitioning the region\ninto rectangles with bases of equal length and heights given by\nfunction values at an endpoint of each base. Using a calculator\nor a computer-based algorithm, students can easily sum the areas\nto obtain a numerical approximation of the desired area. This approximation\ncan then be sharpened by using sequences of rectangles whose bases\nare made to decrease toward zero. Project work might require students\nto investigate other ways of partitioning the region so as to obtain\na more precise estimate. (A description of a process using trapezoids\ncan be found in the standard on mathematical\nconnections.)\n\nUsing interactive graphing\nutilities, college-intending students could examine other characteristics\nof the graphs of functions, including continuity, asymptotes, end\nbehavior (i.e., behavior as |x| ), and concavity. Moreover,\nsuch analysis can be applied with equal ease to the graphs of a\nvariety of complicated functions and to curves specified by polar\nand parametric equations.\n\nComputing technology also\npermits the foreshadowing of analytic ideas for college-intending\nstudents. From a computer-graphics perspective, for example, a differentiable\nfunction can be viewed as a function having the property that a\nsmall portion of its graph, when highly magnified, approximates\na line segment. The \"zoom in\" feature permits students\nto magnify the graph of a function over a small interval to view\nthe approximate segment representation and to compute the gradient\n(slope). Using the computer to plot successive gradients for a series\nof short intervals (see fig. 13.4) suggests\na process that derives functions from functions.\n\nFig. 13.4.Using computer graphics to see that the derivative of y\n= sin x is y = cos x\n\nAlthough developing a foundation\nfor the future study of calculus remains a goal of the 9-12 curriculum\nfor college-intending students, equally important is the development\nof prerequisite understandings for further study of statistics,\nprobability, and discrete mathematics. This standard calls for a\nnew balance of skills, concepts, and applications in that portion\nof the curriculum traditionally associated with preparation for\ncalculus. Instead of devoting large blocks of time to developing\na mastery of paper-and-pencil manipulative skills, more time and\neffort should be spent on developing a conceptual understanding\nof key ideas and their applications. All students should have the\nbenefit of a computer-enhanced introduction to some of the types\nof problems for which calculus was developed.\n\nIn grades 9-12, the\nmathematics curriculum should include the informal exploration of\ncalculus concepts from both a graphical and a numerical perspective\nso that all students can--\n\ndetermine maximum\nand minimum points of a graph and interpret the results in problem\nsituations;\n\ninvestigate limiting\nprocesses by examining infinite sequences and series and areas\nunder curves;\n\nand so that, in addition,\ncollege-intending students can--\n\nunderstand the\nconceptual foundations of limit, the area under a curve, the rate\nof change, and the slope of a tangent line, and their applications\nin other disciplines;\n\nanalyze the graphs\nof polynomial, rational, radical, and transcendental functions.\n\nFocus\n\nThis standard does not\nadvocate the formal study of calculus in high school for\nall students or even for college-intending students\n\nRather, it\ncalls for opportunities for students to systematically, but informally,\ninvestigate the central ideas of calculus--limit, the area under\na curve, the rate of change, and the slope of a tangent line--that\ncontribute to a deepening of their understanding of function and\nits utility in representing and answering questions about real-world\nphenomena.\n\nMost of the mathematics\ndescribed in the other 9-12 standards involve finite processes,\nsuch as determining a sequence of transformations that maps a figure\nonto a congruent figure or approximating a zero of a polynominal\nfunction using an iterative technique\n\n13.1.An informal approach to infinite series\n\nAt a somewhat higher but\nstill intuitive level, the series can be summed by investigating\nthe limit of the sequence of partial sums (either by using a calculator\nor a simple looping computer program or by applying the formula\nfor the sum of a finite geometric series)\n\nUsing a calculator\nor a computer-based algorithm, students can easily sum the areas\nto obtain a numerical approximation of the desired area\n\nThis approximation\ncan then be sharpened by using sequences of rectangles whose bases\nare made to decrease toward zero\n\nProject work might require students\nto investigate other ways of partitioning the region so as to obtain\na more precise estimate\n\n(A description of a process using trapezoids\ncan be found in the standard on mathematical\nconnections.)\n\nAll students could use\na graphing utility to investigate and solve optimization problems,\nincluding the maximum-minimum problems traditionally associated\nwith the first college-level course in calculus, without computing\na derivative\n\n(For an example, see\nExamples of Content Differentiation,) A great deal of mathematical\nunderstanding is reinforced in the context of solving these problems:\ndata analysis, problem formulation, mathematical modeling, geometric\ntopics, translation across multiple representations, and validation.\n\nUsing interactive graphing\nutilities, college-intending students could examine other characteristics\nof the graphs of functions, including continuity, asymptotes, end\nbehavior (i.e., behavior as |x| ), and concavity\n\nFrom a computer-graphics perspective, for example, a differentiable\nfunction can be viewed as a function having the property that a\nsmall portion of its graph, when highly magnified, approximates\na line segment\n\nUsing the computer to plot successive gradients for a series\nof short intervals (see fig\n\n13.4) suggests\na process that derives functions from functions.\n\nFig\n\n13.4.Using computer graphics to see that the derivative of y\n= sin x is y = cos x\n\nAlthough developing a foundation\nfor the future study of calculus remains a goal of the 9-12 curriculum\nfor college-intending students, equally important is the development\nof prerequisite understandings for further study of statistics,\nprobability, and discrete mathematics", "programming_score": 25.359150530918175, "segments_extracted": 26, "original_length": 8005, "compressed_length": 9734}

{"text": "[Reviewed by Fernando Q. Gouvêa, on 05/20/2010]\n\nLie groups play such a central role in mathematics and its applications that all mathematics students should be aware of them. From computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere. Nevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared. Harriet Pollatsek's Lie Groups is her entry in this list.\n\nHowe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.\n\nLie Groups is fundamentally a problem book: each chapter presents a sequence of problems that students should solve. In each chapter, the main sections are followed by a summary section called \"Putting the pieces together.\" Finally, a section called \"A broader view\" tries to give a wider context to the material in that chapter. Everything important is done through problems. Thus, this is a book to be used, not a book to be read.\n\nSome choices I just don't understand. Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere? (My students were fascinated.) Why work only with the one-dimensional Lorenz group? Why not have more pictures? After all, it's easy to draw pictures of the one-dimensional Lie groups.\n\nThere is no representation theory at all. The adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context. With no representation theory, one cannot do much more than say \"the physicists use this a lot,\" without showing how or why. That seems like a pity.\n\nPollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book. Using it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing. If that applies to you, give this book a try.\n\nFernando Q. Gouvêa is Carter Professor of Mathematics at Colby College. He'll be doing the Lie groups thing again soon.\n\nFrom computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere\n\nNevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have\n\nIn a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary\n\nAt Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus\n\nFrom that course was born this book.\n\nLie Groups is fundamentally a problem book: each chapter presents a sequence of problems that students should solve\n\nThe adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context\n\nUsing it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing", "programming_score": 27.831944690657686, "segments_extracted": 16, "original_length": 5641, "compressed_length": 4781}

{"text": "This class will be nothing like your intermediate algebra course. If you prefer equations and expressions, this is not the class for you. We will be looking at topics that might not seem like math to you. Many of these topics will be explored in context of their applications.\n\nMath 1080 is a terminal math course, meaning it does not prepare you for any other math class. This course is intended only for people who will be seeing only one mathematics class in college.\n\nHopefully you went to an adviser who knows your educational goals when deciding which class to take. If you're not sure if this class is right for you, please feel free to email me and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\nI got tired of students having to pay over $100 for the book. So instead of using a traditional textbook, a book written by a friend from graduate school, David Lippman. The textbook is available online at  and is free.\n\nEach week there will be a specific set of material to learn, and assignments and tests on that material. There will be fixed due-dates for those assignments. However, the course is asynchronous, which means that you can log in any time during the week that is convenient for you and complete the assignments.\n\nDuring class there will be frequent assignment, these can range from quizzes to group work. These assignments cannot be made up and make up a significant portion of your grade.\n\nOutside of class a discussion forum will be provided where you can ask questions about the reading, and discuss the material with me and your classmates.In class you can ask me and we can discuss any problems you are having. Usually if you are having trouble, others are as well.\n\nThere will be a set of homework exercises assigned each week. The online homework exercises are required, and graded. However, if you miss a question, it will show the answer, allowing you to self-diagnose your mistake, and then you can try similar problems until you get the questions correct. You can ask questions in the discussion board about any homework questions you have difficulty with.\n\nAdditionally, each week there will be an assignment not from the book. This assignment will be a more open-ended question that usually requires a bit more work, conceptual understanding, possibly some outside research, and may require a written solution or explanation. In some cases these may be collaborative assignments with intermediary due dates in the middle of the week. Be sure to keep track of the due dates.\n\nExcept in the case of collaborative assignments requiring feedback to fellow students, there are no graded forum response, email, or log-in frequency requirements. However, I strongly encourage you to not wait until the last day of the week to begin your assignments, as this does not allow time to seek out assistance if needed.\n\nThe course learning outcomes (aka objectives) describe what abilities and skills a successful student is expected to develop and demonstrate in this course. While often related, these are separate from the course content (the specific topics we'll be covering)\n\nCommunicate methods of solutions and solutions to problems for the clarity of the receiver.\n\nModel and solve problems using graphical methods.\n\nRepresent data using a histogram and/or other graphical forms.\n\nSolve problems using algorithms or formulas.\n\nIf something major comes up (a death in the family, hospitalization, etc.), go ahead and email me or call me to let me know, and we can work something out.\n\nThe discussion board is a forum where you can ask questions about the reading or homework, and get help from me or your classmates. The idea is to have the class operate like a study group - with all of you working together to further your learning. This is what distinguishes an online class from a traditional distance learning or math lab course.\n\nUse the Discussion Board to ask for help on problems you don't understand how to do. If you do understand how to do the problems, help out your classmates by answering questions on the discussion board.\n\nI will monitor the homework discussion boards, and will respond to questions if they go unanswered, or if someone provides an incorrect response. If you have additional questions, didn't understand the answer someone gave you, or have a question that has gone unanswered, don't hesitate to email me and ask questions. However, please use the discussion boards first, so that others can benefit from your questions.\n\nAdditionally, you can get help from the drop-in tutors at the Academic Support Center on either campus. Be aware that not all tutors have taken this math course, and may have difficulty helping you. Writing tutors are also available to help with writing assignments.\n\nIf you have questions about the homework or readings, you can ask them in class. Feel free to email me, call me, or visit me in my office for additional help.\n\nWhen you post a message or email me, please understand that I am not online all the time. Please allow at least 24 hours for me to respond to your questions, possibly longer on the weekends (up to 48 hours).\n\nThe first week of class there is a bio assignment and syllabus quiz.\n\nIn class assignments will count 20% of your course grade.\n\nYour weighted percent in the class will be converted to a decimal grade via this scale:\n\nOnline courses have the same academic integrity as any other college course. You can trust that I will respond to your questions and comments in a timely manner, as well as be timely and fair in grading submitted assignments.\n\nAs your instructor, I trust that you will make your best effort to complete the activities in a timely manner and to the best of your abilities. If there is an unforeseen change in your schedule feel free to contact me for alternative arrangements. I expect that the work you submit for this course will be your own work. Cheating and/or plagiarism will not be tolerated. Please refer to the college's Academic Dishonesty policy for more details.\n\nThere are ways to express emotions without words. These are called emoticons. You've probably seen several already in computer writing: ;-) :) :o) :-( etc., These are actually faces turned on their side to represent emotions. They take the place of body language and facial expressions that are a natural part of communication. In this setting, it's difficult sometimes to discern between sarcasm and criticism. Using emoticons can often convey the context of the comment when words can't.\n\nMost importantly, this class will be free of sexual, verbal, and racial discrimination or harassment.\n\nSo instead of using a traditional textbook, a book written by a friend from graduate school, David Lippman\n\nAttending Lectures and reading the textbook will be your primary way to learn the material for the course.\n\nDuring class there will be frequent assignment, these can range from quizzes to group work\n\nHowever, if you miss a question, it will show the answer, allowing you to self-diagnose your mistake, and then you can try similar problems until you get the questions correct\n\nThese questions will be numerical, multiple-choice, matching, or fill-in-the-blank.\n\nAdditionally, each week there will be an assignment not from the book\n\nThis assignment will be a more open-ended question that usually requires a bit more work, conceptual understanding, possibly some outside research, and may require a written solution or explanation\n\nWhile often related, these are separate from the course content (the specific topics we'll be covering)\n\nDemonstrate a positive attitude towards mathematics and an appreciation for its power and uses.\n\nExplore new and unfamiliar problems and employ critical thinking skills.\n\nForm and communicate generalizations discovered through individual or group investigations.\n\nCommunicate methods of solutions and solutions to problems for the clarity of the receiver.\n\nModel and solve problems using graphical methods.\n\nAnalyze and interpret data, as well as calculate statistical mean and median and use these to describe data.\n\nRepresent data using a histogram and/or other graphical forms.\n\nSolve problems using algorithms or formulas.\n\nExamine multicultural perspectives of at least one mathematical topic studied.\n\nSolve, analyze, and effectively communicate the solution to problems of the instructor's choice.\n\nParticipate actively and responsibly in all course activities.\n\nWithin each sections folder, you will find a list of that sections topic-based learning outcomes, and how they related back to these course outcomes\n\nIf a graded assignment is turned in late, I will never give more than 50% of the possible points.\n\nIf something major comes up (a death in the family, hospitalization, etc.), go ahead and email me or call me to let me know, and we can work something out.\n\nGetting Help\n\nThe discussion board is a forum where you can ask questions about the reading or homework, and get help from me or your classmates\n\nThis is what distinguishes an online class from a traditional distance learning or math lab course.\n\nUse the Discussion Board to ask for help on problems you don't understand how to do\n\nHowever, please use the discussion boards first, so that others can benefit from your questions.\n\nI can't stress enough that without being able to see the expression on your face, there's no way for me to judge if you understand my or a fellow student's explanation to your questions\n\nSee the Instructor Information to see what my office hours are this quarter.\n\nAdditionally, you can get help from the drop-in tutors at the Academic Support Center on either campus\n\nFeel free to email me, call me, or visit me in my office for additional help.\n\nWhen you post a message or email me, please understand that I am not online all the time\n\nUsing emoticons can often convey the context of the comment when words can't.\n\nMost importantly, this class will be free of sexual, verbal, and racial discrimination or harassment.\n\nNC Policy\n\nThe NC policy has changed beginning with this semester", "programming_score": 22.41817366611867, "segments_extracted": 41, "original_length": 13382, "compressed_length": 10036}
{"text": "Launched in May, 2000, with the support of an NSF grant, Project WELCOME is a new part of the\nSUMMA Program. WELCOME\nbrings together elements of three MAA program themes: academic technology, professional development, and promoting involvement of historically underrepresented groups. The general goals include:\n\nThe interactive explorations are integrated environments which combine graphical, dynamical, symbolic, textual, and numerical representations of mathematical ideas and relations. Users interact with these environments in the familiar point and click idiom of internet web pages. The goal of each activity is to encourage students to experiment with some mathematical context by manipulating aspects of the environment and observing the results. The interactions are intended to be so natural that the environments take on a kind of virtual realism that brings mathematical constructs to life. This can take the form of moving and deforming geometric objects (in the style of Geometer's Sketchpad), but can also involve interacting with symbolic, logical, and numerical aspects of an environment.\n\nA past MAA effort, the Interactive Mathematical Text Project (IMTP), demonstrated that empowering teachers to create these activities is both feasible and desirable. In particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations. A showcase of these activities is freely available at the Mathwright website. Visitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.1), necessary for using the activities.\n\nOne of the goals of Project WELCOME is to produce series of interactive explorations that are directly tied to specific courses. The materials that are produced by the project will be distributed at a WELCOME Library on the internet, starting in the summer or fall of 2001.\n\nThe MAA has an ongoing interest in increasing the participation in mathematics of historically underrepresented groups. Project WELCOME is founded on the belief that technology can make a contribution in this area. The Project Directors believe that interactive mathematical explorations are a particularly attractive and powerful lure to the investigation of mathematical ideas. It is hoped that this lure will help attract students who might otherwise not elect to study mathematics.\n\nIn order to bring interactive mathematical explorations to these students, WELCOME is enlisting the aid of their teachers. The Project will build a community of Mathwright developers among faculty in institutions which predominantly serve the target populations. The role of teachers in developing, as well as using, Mathwright activities is intentional and significant. For one thing, creating the activities themselves will give the teachers a greater sense of ownership, and will assure that the activities will be compatible with the instructional goals and philosophies of these teachers. There is another reason to involve teachers as developers. Presumably, the historical under-participation among some student populations reflects particular obstacles that these students face. If so, then faculty at institutions which serve these populations may have special insights about the nature of the obstacles and strategies for overcoming them. Such insights will be a valuable resource in developing Mathwright activities for Project WELCOME.\n\nProject WELCOME has many features in common with MAA professional development programs. The faculty developers will each be teamed with an experienced Mathwright user who will serve as a mentor and collaborator. The goals of the project go beyond training new Mathwright developers. The idea is to foster a community of teachers using interactive explorations. The community will interact electronically through email and a project web page. In addition, participants will get together at national MAA meetings, where they will be encouraged to make presentations of their work. In particular, there will be several contributed paper presentations related to WELCOME at the January, 2001 meeting in New Orleans.\n\nIn particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations\n\nVisitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.1), necessary for using the activities.\n\nOne of the goals of Project WELCOME is to produce series of interactive explorations that are directly tied to specific courses\n\nThe idea is to foster a community of teachers using interactive explorations\n\nIn addition, participants will get together at national MAA meetings, where they will be encouraged to make presentations of their work", "programming_score": 13.804527885146328, "segments_extracted": 11, "original_length": 5433, "compressed_length": 4848}

{"text": "rational functions take two\n\nTwo weeks ago in my Algebra 2 Trig Honors class we were finishing up our unit on rational expressions, equations, and functions. In past years, students at this level had focused on graphing only simple rational functions – transformations of y=1/x. (In Precalculus, students are exposed to general rational functions.) I was feeling frustrated, though, at how limited this approach felt – I didn't want students to be misled into ignoring the big vast ocean full of rational functions after looking at a goldfish bowl-sized sample. (Questions like: \"so it will always look like this?\" were driving me crazy.) But at the same time, I didn't want to bog them down with a tedious approach to graphing general cases by hand. I just wanted my students to get a feel for all of the different crazy shapes these graphs can make, notice patterns, and begin the process of generalizing.\n\nLast year I had included an investigation of general rational functions using Wolfram Alpha on a homework assignment. In hindsight, leaving this activity for homework wasn't a good call – there wasn't enough time for thoughtful follow-up, and by having students work alone they missed out on the magic of discussing their findings with others and building understanding together. So this year, I took an extra class day to allow students time to play around with more complicated rational functions on the Desmos calculator. (Which I am a little bit in love with.)\n\nIn my 2nd period class, I didn't do a great job of setting up and explaining what I had envisioned for the hour. I showed them the Desmos calculator, told them they should be graphing a variety of rational functions, and gave them a sheet with 4 specific examples with bullet points for guided questions underneath to use as a framework for their investigation. On the back board, I had written \"What do you notice/what are you wondering about…\" with different categories for them to record some of their findings throughout the hour. The idea was that throughout class, I would circulate and peek in on their conversations, help answer some questions or poke at their thinking a bit, they would record their observations and questions on the back board, and at the end of class we'd save 10 minutes to discuss our findings on the board.\n\nAs I turned students loose to begin working, some problems became evident pretty quickly. While students were comfortable recognizing the one vertical and one horizontal asymptote for simple rational functions, they couldn't \"see\" the asymptotes for the more complicated graphs. This to me indicated that they didn't have a good enough understanding of what an asymptote truly was, but instead had mastered an algorithm for graphing the simple rational functions. I tried to chat with groups of students to see where the disconnect was, and I encouraged students to graph the lines that they visually predicted were asymptotes – then connect that to the algebra of each function. I also realized I had not done a good job explaining or modeling the way they should record what they noticed/wondered on the back board – I ended up with lots of random pictures and little interpretation or generalizations. I also did a horrible job keeping track of the timing of the class. It became clear we weren't going to have the 10 minutes I wanted at the end of class to pull together our big findings – instead, I had to take pictures of the back board and wait until the next day to summarize their investigation.\n\nThere were more nuanced conversations than the sloppy work on the board indicated, but overall I wasn't happy with the way things had gone. I didn't feel like we had arrived at enough clarity or closure for the big ideas I wanted them to be tackling.\n\nLucky for me, I learned a bit from my mistakes and in my 4th period class I did a MUCH better job of setting up the activity. I graphed the first specific example on Desmos, talked through how I could visually \"see\" the 2 vertical asymptotes and 1 horizontal asymptote, showed them to graph those lines to confirm the asymptotic behavior, returned to the algebra of the example function to make connections between the algebra and the graph, then added a generalization to the board of noticing/wondering.\n\nDuring this hour, the students did a better job of working together, asked me fewer questions, and were more able to generalize their findings. They even surprised me with some observations I was *not* expecting them to make (see the last one under \"V.A.\") and a few students figured out how to use sliders with Desmos to more efficiently explore how changing different bits of the function they graphed would impact its shape. You can tell by looking at their noticings/wonderings how much more successful my second shot at this lesson was. During the follow-up conversation at the end of class, I addressed all of the points on the board, asked for students to help respond to some of the questions, and felt that the majority of students left with a better understanding of both the important features of these graphs and how the algebra of the functions controls their shape.\n\nSince I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit. General rational functions were not tested (only transformations of y=1/x), but I did decide to include a question that had students explain the shape of the parent function y=1/x. It was a great way for me to see if all of the investigation and conversation about the shapes of the graphs had paid off… were my students more \"mathematically fluent\" in the vocabulary and ideas associated with rational functions? I did have some very strong responses, and I've included my favorite below.\n\nI'm sure there are ways for me to tweak and improve upon this lesson for future classes, but I was happy with the chance it afforded students to talk, play, investigate, and generalize.\n\nSome comments and questions here\n* Love the guided questions along the way. Do you intend to move away from the more specific clues? Is the unit long enough for that?\n* Love the writing on the second set of board snapshots. Why is it that students are so determined to misspell the word vertical even when it is in the question that they are answering?\n* In addition to division for slant asymptotes, do you suggest division as a way to get at horizontal asymptotes as well?\n* How comfortable are your kids with 'washing away the remainder' in these processes?\n* I am intrigued by DESMOS – haven't used it. I'm partial to GeoGebra myself.\n\nI like how you have students put their observations on the board – I'm not sure my algebra students are persistent enough in their investigations, but I would like to try something similar to this in Geometry. Have you ever done it with a class that is not honors?\n\nI just wanted my students to get a feel for all of the different crazy shapes these graphs can make, notice patterns, and begin the process of generalizing.\n\nLast year I had included an investigation of general rational functions using Wolfram Alpha on a homework assignment\n\nI didn't feel like we had arrived at enough clarity or closure for the big ideas I wanted them to be tackling.\n\nLucky for me, I learned a bit from my mistakes and in my 4th period class I did a MUCH better job of setting up the activity\n\nDuring the follow-up conversation at the end of class, I addressed all of the points on the board, asked for students to help respond to some of the questions, and felt that the majority of students left with a better understanding of both the important features of these graphs and how the algebra of the functions controls their shape.\n\nSince I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit\n\nDo you intend to move away from the more specific clues?

Major emphasis is on problem solving with laboratory work and class demonstrations to provide data for developing analytical models that can be understood and manipulated mathematically.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, linear algebra/matrix theory is an absolute requirement. Linear Algebra is the mathematical study of vectors and vector spaces (also called linear spaces). Matrices are widely used to represent the linear transformations that input one vector and output another. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Calculus. The only REAL prerequisite for this material is a good knowledge of high school algebra. We have designated AB Calculus as a requirement because everyone will need strong algebra skills and good analytical ability. Linear Algebra has many practical applications, not limited to math/physics/engineering. It shows up in economics, logistics, finance, computer science, operations research, and lots of other disciplines.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, advanced calculus is an absolute requirement. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Advanced Placement Calculus AB & BC. The material in these courses however, has generally been limited to one independent variable expressed in the form of y = f(x). Multivariable/vector calculus is used to describe phenomena that result from the simultaneous effects of many variables. For example, in the case of the ideal gas law from chemistry, the pressure of an ideal gas is a result of the number of moles of the gas, the volume of the container, and the temperature. We could express this as P = f(n,V,T). If all three are changed simultaneously, how is the pressure changed?\n\nPre-AP PreCalculus provides opportunities to study real numbers, functions and their graphs, trigonometric relationships, parametric representations, sequences, and series.

{"text": "\"102 Combinatorial Problems\" consists of carefully selected problems that have been used in the training and testing of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team. Key features: * Provides in-depth enrichment in the important areas of combinatorics by reorganizing and enhancing problem-solving tactics and strategies * Topics include: combinatorial arguments and identities, generating functions, graph theory, recursive relations, sums and products, probability, number theory, polynomials, theory of equations, complex numbers in geometry, algorithmic proofs, combinatorial and advanced geometry, functional equations and classical inequalities The book is systematically organized, gradually building combinatorial skills and techniques and broadening the student's view of mathematics. Aside from its practical use in training teachers and students engaged in mathematical competitions, it is a source of enrichment that is bound to stimulate interest in a variety of mathematical areas that are tangential to combinatorics. [via]\n\nMore editions of 102 Combinatorial Problems: From the Training of the USA Imo TeamThis book is of interest to mathematicians and computer scientists working in finite mathematics and combinatorics. It presents a breakthrough method for analyzing complex summations. Beautifully written, the book contains practical applications as well as conceptual developments that will have applications in other areas of mathematics.\n\nFrom the table of contents: * Proof Machines * Tightening the Target * The Hypergeometric Database * The Five Basic Algorithms: Sister Celine's Method, Gosper&'s Algorithm, Zeilberger's Algorithm, The WZ Phenomenon, Algorithm Hyper * Epilogue: An Operator Algebra Viewpoint * The WWW Sites and the Software (Maple and Mathematica) Each chapter contains an introduction to the subject and ends with a set of exercises. [via]\n\nThe format of this book is unique in that it combines features of a traditional text with those of a problem book. The material is presented through a series of problems, about 250 in all, with connecting text; this is supplemented by a further 250 problems suitable for homework assignment. The problems are structured in order to introduce concepts in a logical order, and in a thought-provoking way. The first four sections of the book deal with basic combinatorial entities; the last four cover special counting methods. Many applications to probability are included along the way. Students from a wide range of backgrounds, mathematics, computer science or engineering will appreciate this appealing introduction. [via]\n\nAs linear orders, as elements of the symmetric group, modeled by matrices, modeled by graphs&permutations are omnipresent in modern combinatorics. They are omnipresent but also multifaceted, and while several excellent books explore particular aspects of the subject, no one book has covered them all. Even the classic results are scattered in various resources.\n\nCombinatorics of Permutations offers the first comprehensive, up to date treatment of both enumerative and extremal combinatorics and looks at permutation as linear orders and as elements of the symmetric group. The author devotes two full chapters to the young but active area of pattern avoidance. He explores the quest for the Stanley-Wilf conjecture and includes the recent and spectacular Marcus-Tardos proof of this problem. He examines random permutations and Standard Young Tableaux and provides an overview of the very rich algebraic combinatorics of permutations. The final chapter takes an in-depth look at combinatorial sorting algorithms.\n\nThe author's style is relaxed, entertaining, and clearly reflects his enthusiasm for the \"serious fun\" the subject holds. Filled with applications from a variety of fields and exercises that draw upon recent research results, this book serves equally well as a graduate-level text and a reference for combinatorics researchersThe book presents the solutions to two problems: the first is the construction of expanding graphs graphs which are of fundamental importance for communication networks and computer science; the second is the Ruziewicz problem concerning the finitely additive invariant measures on spheres. Both problems were partially solved using the Kazhdan property (T) from representation theory of semi-simple Lie groups. Later, complete soultions were obtained for both problems using the Ramanujan conjecture from analytic number theory. The author, who played an important role in these developments, explains the two problems and their solutions from a perspective which reveals why all these seemingly unrelated topics are so interconnected. The unified approach shows interrelations between different branches of mathematics such as graph theory, measure theory, Riemannian geometry, discrete subgroups of Lie groups, representation theory and analytic number theory.\n\n\"This exciting book marks the genesis of a new field. It is a field in which one passes back and forth at will through the looking glass dividing the discrete from the continuous. (...) The book is a charming combination of topics from group theory (finite and infinite), combinatorics, number theory, harmonic analysis.\" - Zentralblatt MATH\n\n\"The Appendix, written by J. Rogawski, explains the Jacquet-Langlands theory and indicates Delignes proof of the Petersson-Ramanujan conjecture. It would merit its own review. (...) In conclusion, this is a wonderful way of transmitting recent mathematical research directly \"from the producer to the consumer.\" - MathSciNet\n\nThis book is a concise, yet carefully written, introduction to modern graph theory, covering all its major recent developments. It This second edition extends the first in two ways. It offers a thoroughly revised and updated chapter on graph minors, which now includes full new proofs of two of the central Robertson-Seymour theorems (as well as a detailed sketch of the entire proof of their celebrated Graph Minor Theorem). Second, there is now a section of hints for all the exercises, to enhance their value for both individual study and classroom use andThe importance of discrete mathematics has increased dramatically within the last few years but until now, it has been difficult-if not impossible-to find a single reference book that effectively covers the subject. To fill that void, The Handbook of Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics presents a comprehensive collection of ready reference material for all of the important areas of discrete mathematics, including those essential to its applications in computer science and engineering. Its topics include:\n\nMany glossaries of important terms\n\nLists of important theorems and formulas\n\nHelpful descriptions of algorithms\n\nCitations of Web pages that supplement the text If you have ever had to find information from discrete mathematics in your work-or just out of curiosity-you probably had to search through a variety of books to find it. Never again. The Handbook of Discrete Mathematics is now available and has virtually everything you need-everything important to both theory and practice.\n\nJacob E. Goodman, co-founder and editor of Discrete & Computational Geometry, the preeminent journal on this area in the international mathematics and computer science community, joins forces with the distinguished computer scientist Joseph O'Rourke and other well-known authorities to produce the definitive handbook on these two interrelated fields.\n\nOver the past decade or so, researchers and professionals in discrete geometry and the newer field of computational geometry have developed a highly productive collaborative relationship, where each area benefits from the methods and insights of the other. At the same time that discrete and computational geometry are becoming more closely identified, applications of the results of this work are being used in an increasing number of widely differing areas, from computer graphics and linear programming to manufacturing and robotics. The authors have answered the need for a comprehensive handbook for workers in these and related fields, and for other users of the body of results.\n\nWhile much information can be found on discrete and computational geometry, it is scattered among many sources, and individual books and articles are often narrowly focused. Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry brings together, for the first time, all of the major results in both these fields into one volume. Thousands of results - theorems, algorithms, and tables - throughout the volume definitively cover the field, while numerous applications from many different fields demonstrate practical usage. The material is presented clearly enough to assist the novice, but in enough depth to appeal to the specialist. Every technical term is clearly defined in an easy-to-use glossary. Over 200 figures illustrate the concepts presented and provide supporting examples. Information on current geometric software - what it does, how efficiently it does it, and where to find it - is also included. [via]\n\nThe last ten years have seen a number of significant advances in Hopf algebras. The best known is the introduction of quantum groups, which are Hopf algebras that arose in mathematical physics and now have connections to many areas of mathematics. In addition, several conjectures of Kaplansky have been solved, the most striking of which is a kind of Lagrange's theorem for Hopf algebras. Work on actions of Hopf algebras has unified earlier results on group actions, actions of Lie algebras, and graded algebras. This book brings together many of these recent developments from the viewpoint of the algebraic structure of Hopf algebras and their actions and coactions. Quantum groups are treated as an important example, rather than as an end in themselves. The two introductory chapters review definitions and basic facts; otherwise, most of the material has not previously appeared in book form. Providing an accessible introduction to Hopf algebras, this book would make an excellent graduate textbook for a course in Hopf algebras or an introduction to quantum groups. [via]\n\nThis book fills a need for a thorough introduction to graph theory that features both the understanding and writing of proofs about graphs. Verification that algorithms work is emphasized more than their complexity. An effective use of examples, and huge number of interesting exercises, demonstrate the topics of trees and distance, matchings and factors, connectivity and paths, graph coloring, edges and cycles, and planar graphs. For those who need to learn to make coherent arguments in the fields of mathematics and computer science.\n\nIntroductory Combinatorics emphasizes combinatorial ideas, including the pigeon-hole principle, counting techniques, permutations and combinations, Polya counting, binomial coefficients, inclusion-exclusion principle, generating functions and recurrence relations, and combinatortial structures (matchings, designs, graphs). Written to be entertaining and readable, this book's lively style reflects the author's joy for teaching the subject. It presents an excellent treatment of Polya's Counting Theorem that doesn't assume the student is familiar with group theory. It also includes problems that offer good practice of the principles it presents. The third edition of Introductory Combinatorics has been updated to include new material on partially ordered sets, Dilworth's Theorem, partitions of integers and generating functions. In addition, the chapters on graph theory have been completely revised. A valuable book for any reader interested in learning more about combinatorics. [via]\n\nThe algorithms in this text have been rewritten in a language-neutral pseudocode making the book useful to computer science students. Each chapter begins with a \"motivating problem\" which occurs later as an exercise. Tables and bullet notes have been added througout, with examples. [via]\n\nThe (mathematical) heroes of this book are \"perfect proofs\": brilliant ideas, clever connections and wonderful observations that bring new insight and surprising perspectives on basic and challenging problems from Number Theory, Geometry, Analysis, Combinatorics, and Graph Theory. Thirty beautiful examples are presented here. They are candidates for The Book in which God records the perfect proofs - according to the late Paul Erd/s, who himself suggested many of the topics in this collection. The result is a book which will be fun for everybody with an interest in mathematics, requiring only a very modest (undergraduate) mathematical background. For this revised and expanded second edition several chapters have been revised and expanded, and three new chapters have been added. According to the great mathematician Paul Erd/s, God maintains perfect mathematical proofs in The Book. This book presents the authors candidates for such \"perfect proofs,\" those which contain brilliant ideas, clever connections, and wonderful observations, bringing new insight and surprising perspectives to problems from number theory, geometry, sis, com binatorics, and graph theory. As a result, this book will be fun reading for anyone with an interest in mathematics. [via]\n\n\"...

{"text": "It is easy to just do the review homework and feel like you are ready for the test. You need to do this and more. Study for the test or quiz by going back through problems that have been given and solved in class. Actually redo them and check your work. Studying for math is DOING the MATH.\n\nDo your homework every day. Try not to skip any days of homework. If you are cramming all your work into a short single session you will find this usually ends up in frustration as well as poor long term memory with the topic.\n\nThe most difficult questions will usually teach you the most about the material. Never skip them. Try to get the most exposure to these problems as you can. Try to solve them on your own. Revisit them. Go in for help. Ask a question on the problems in class.\n\nGive yourself a break when working with math. If you are being efficient, then three fifteen minute sessions in a day are better than one 45 minute session. Stand up. Stretch. Go for a walk. Move your work to a new place. A break is needed when working with math.\n\n7. Have a good attitude.\n\n8. Go in for help with your teacher and bring a specific question.\n\nWhen you bring in a specific question to your math teacher they can help you with where you are struggling. The teacher then can typically give you more examples that are similar to what you are struggling with.\n\nYesterday I made a math problem so that it took up one whole page of typing paper. I cut it up into 6 equal pieces that were approximately 3 by 3 inches. I put it a random order and put a paper clip on it. I did this for 5 problems in all and 2 sets of each for a total of 10 questions. I have 20 students in my class. So I had my students work in pairs. It is real easy to cut these problems up with a paper cutter. See the above cut out lines that I took with the problem.\n\nThen I put the 5 stations with 2 sets of the same problem around the room. Four people, or two pairs of partners would be at each station. I would then have them start on the problem and set the timer for ONE MINUTE. The partners together would have to unscramble the pieces and then solve the problem. They would write their answer down on their paper. Once they were done, they could check the answer that is provided at each station. After the minute was over and students had checked their answers, I told them to rotate. They went to the next station and we did the process all over again.\n\nTry to get the most exposure to these problems as you can\n\nI put it a random order and put a paper clip on it\n\nSee the above cut out lines that I took with the problem.\n\nThen I put the 5 stations with 2 sets of the same problem around the room", "programming_score": 21.436848203939746, "segments_extracted": 12, "original_length": 3452, "compressed_length": 2667}
{"text": "However, we need to continue a little further with this answer because Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are terms that refer mostly to the traditional way that Algebra has been taught. Traditional Algebra 1 classes attempt to cover most of Algebra in the first year, but the methods that are used, and the speed with which the material is covered, hinders student understanding of the material. Instead, the student is just exposed to memorizing rules, formulas, tricks, and shortcuts. By the time they get to what is called an Algebra 2 course, (sometimes after they take a Geometry course), they have forgotten almost all of the Algebra that they memorized. So, that Algebra 2 course (which is by definition, a rehash of whatever has been called \"Algebra 1\"), must repeat practically all of the Algebra 1 course. In fact, it usually repeats a lot of the Pre-Algebra material as well. This is usually referred to as the \"spiral method\" of learning, and it is not very effective in helping students to excel, especially at this level of mathematics.\n\nWe think that this huge overlap is generally unproductive, and largely unnecessary if the concepts are taught analytically. Therefore we call our program \"Algebra: A Complete Course,\" because we employ a mastery-learning approach, sometimes moving at a slower pace, but without the overlap. As a result, students often complete the course even more quickly.\n\nVideoText's Algebra: A Complete Course program contains 176 video lessons contained in 10 unit directories. The program covers Pre-Algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II, and is a firm foundation for students advancing to VideoText's Geometry: A Complete Course, covering Geometry and Trigonometry.\n\n176 Video Lessons - Each of the 5-10 minute lessons explore Algebra concepts in a detailed logical order. Because no shortcuts or tricks are used, the methods are easy to follow and promote clear understanding.\n\n360 pages of Course Notes - These notes allow students to review the logical development of a concept. Each page chronologically follows the video lesson, repeating exactly what was shown on the screen.\n\nThe quality of mathematics is extremely important to me, as math and science go hand-in-hand. There are many students who cannot handle my chemistry course, for example, because they have not had a good algebra course. That is why I strongly encourage you to look at Videotext Interactive's algebra course. It is, truly, the best that I have seen.\n\nThe course teaches real mathematics. It does not use tricks or shortcuts. Instead, it teaches the student to think mathematically. That's what is missing from many algebra courses! The use of animation and graphics is excellent. They do not detract from the learning, as is the case with some video courses I have seen. Instead, they enhance the student's ability to understand what is happening in each and every step along the way.\n\nBy the time they get to what is called an Algebra 2 course, (sometimes after they take a Geometry course), they have forgotten almost all of the Algebra that they memorized\n\nThat's what is missing from many algebra courses!

With then–Harvard professor and later Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, he studied what would be the most effective way of helping students from impoverished families do better in school — their answer: to improve income levels rather than to simply spend on schools. Later, his analysis of the importance to learning of smaller class sizes buttressed the Clinton Administration's initiative to hire 100,000 teachers. And, as far back as the 1940s, Mosteller composed an early statistical analysis of baseball: After his team, the Boston Red Sox, lost the 1946 World Series, he demonstrated that luck plays an enhanced role in a short series, even for a strong team.

{"text": "Connected Math Project 2 (CMP2) and\nGomath and Glencoe Math\n\nRead below for detailed information about these district programs, district mathematics partnerships, and curriculum maps.\n\nConnected Math Project 2 (CMP2) is a researched based program that is being used for middle school mathematics instruction. The overarching goal of the program is that all students be able to reason and communicate proficiently in mathematics. CMP helps students develop an understanding of important concepts, skills, procedures, and ways of thinking and reasoning in number sense, measurement, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics. The concepts are embedded in engaging problems that students explore individually, in a small group, or with a whole class. The problems presented over time give student practice with important concepts, related skills, and algorithms. A three-phased workshop model that support s problem centered instruction is used to deliver the curriculum in these classes. Teachers have had opportunities for training in CMP2 made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, and CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning. The District Math Coaches and Lesley University will continue to provide teachers with training in the mathematical content and implementation of lessons.\n\nThe Math programs are implemented using the Workshop Model. This three-phase instructional workshop model used to deliver instruction in all math classrooms in grades K - 8. In the initial phase, Launch or Opening – the teacher sets the problem, introduces new ideas, clarifies definitions reviews, old concepts, and connects to past experiences without lowering the challenge of the task. During the second phase, Explore or Work Time – students work independently or in small groups to gather data, share ideas, look for patterns, and make conjectures. In the final phase Summary or Closing – the students present and discuss their solutions as well as the strategies they used as the teacher guides them to reach the mathematical goal of the class and connect their new understanding to prior knowledge. Teachers have had opportunities for training on the workshop model made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning, and Math Investigations Training from Hampshire Educational Collaborative. District Math Coaches will continue to work with teachers to enhance the implementation of the program and help to deepen the understanding and connection of the mathematical strands.\n\nCurriculum Maps for K – 8 have been designed to ensure that students are exposed to a rigorous curriculum in every school and every grade, and to have consistent instruction and assessment district wide. The district's expectation is for students to successfully meet the Massachusetts Mathematics Standards and to score at the proficient range on the MCAS test in mathematics. In order to facilitate this, teachers are required to follow the curriculum maps. The successful implementation of these maps requires teachers to work through the project and problems prior to planning their lessons.

{"text": "BEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.\n\nMark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995. He is a full-time Associate Professor at Palomar College and has taught there for the past 9 years. He is a member of AMATYC and regularly attends the national AMATYC and ICTCM conferences. He has also done extensive reviewing and testing of various classroom technologies and materials. Through this work, he is committed to teaching his students through applications and using technology to help his students both understand the mathematics in context and communicate their results clearly. Intermediate algebra is one of his favorite courses to teach, and he continues to teach several sections of this course each year.\n\n\"This book has just the right balance of skill and application problems.It does a good job of helping the students throughout the sectionswithout just giving all the answers away.\"Kate Bella, Instructor, Manchester Community College \"It is easily readable for students, the explanations are clear, and themargin notes are a nice feature that makes the text more reader friendly.\"Daniel Lopez, Instructor, Brookdale Community College \"I love how the text is centered on real-life situations.

{"text": "Because of its large command structure and intricate syntax, Mathematica can be difficult to learn. Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\" . . . [a] treasure house of material for students and teachers alike . . . can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic.\" --London Times Higher Education Supplement \"The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking.\" --SIAM Review \"Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards . . . to novelty . . . each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically.\" --Mathematical Reviews A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling provides in-depth and systematic coverage of the art and science of mathematical modelling. Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.\n\nMost texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data.\nAlthough the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.\n\nThe first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.\n\nDeveloped from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.\n\nAlthough the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation.\nA First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented.\nDeveloped from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.\n\nThe field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.\n\nR is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields.\nDoing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive.\nA Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.\n\nWILEY-INTERSCIENCE PAPERBACK SERIESFrom the Reviews of History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750\"This is a marvelous book . . .

Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code.\nThe book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.\n\nWolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice\n\nThe presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit\n\nThe text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\"This book is a comprehensive package for knowledge sharing on Mathematics\n\nIt deserves to become a classic.\" --London Times Higher Education Supplement \"The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking.\" --SIAM Review \"Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards\n\nMesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity\n\nUsing a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative\n\nChapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models\n\nSpecial features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis\n\nAn Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.\n\nDeveloped from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations\n\nThis authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study\n\nAccompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines\n\nIt begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques\n\nFor each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method?

{"text": "Many years of Teaching led Geoff Renshaw to develop Maths for Economics as a resource which builds your self-confidence in maths by using a gradual learning gradient and constantly reinforcing learning with examples and exercises. Some students embarking on this module feel that they have lost their confidence in maths, or perhaps never had any in the first place. The author has designed the Book so that whether you have a maths A level, GCSE, or perhaps feel that you need to go back over the very basics, Knowledge is built up in small steps, not big jumps. Once you are confident that you have firmly grasped the foundations, this book will help you to make the progression beyond the Mechanical exercises and into the development of a maths tool-kit for the analysis of economic and Business problems.

{"text": "This model features a classic sequence of courses that emphasizes connections across\ncontent strands. Data analysis topics have been added to the familiar high school\nmathematics curriculum. Topics\nare grouped so that Year 1 focuses on algebra and algebraic reasoning, Year 2 focuses\non geometry, and Year 3 returns to a focus on further algebraic topics leading to\ntrigonometry and pre-calculus. This sequence works well for many students, is familiar\nto teachers and parents, and fits the design of many instructional materials. However,\nthis does not mean that the status quo is working for all students. Even though\ncourse topics and sequencing may look familiar, effective strategies for presenting\nthe material must be implemented to make this or any model curriculum successful.\nStudents must be placed in a course for which they have the prerequisites and have\nadequate time and support to fully understand the material. Students must be engaged\nwith rich problems throughout each course in order to understand the mathematics\nfully and develop creative problem solving and reasoning skills. Students must also\nbe expected to communicate mathematical ideas using formal mathematical language.\nTeachers in schools adopting Model C will benefit from professional development\nthat includes strategies for successfully teaching all students and that familiarizes\nteachers with sources of problems to deepen student understanding of mathematical\ntopics.\n\nAll students require a rigorous and demanding curriculum in order to develop sound reasoning and strong problem solving skills. The topics covered in Year 1 of this model can provide this rigor. Students progress from their informal middle school experience with number relationships, data analysis, and linear equations to more formal definitions, algebraic reasoning, and graphical representations. With this model, as with any model, different students may require different amounts of time and support to become proficient with the mathematics.\n\nThe focus of this course is the development of algebraic understanding, reasoning, and skills using mathematical language to express abstract ideas. The Year 1 course has four main themes:\n\ntransition from generalized arithmetic to algebra;\n\nlinear equations and functions;\n\nnonlinear functions (introduction)\n\nMore specifically, students will solve linear equations and inequalities and systems\nof equations. They will graph a variety of functions and add the study of probability and statistics to the topics covered in a typical Algebra I course. Appropriate use of technology is encouraged to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nThe second year model develops formal logic and reasoning skills through the study of Euclidean geometry. Although geometry is a subject of importance and practical use, the main goal of the course is to develop students' abilities to reason and to present coherent arguments. In addition to this deep involvement with logic and deduction, students discover connections between formal geometry and the algebraic techniques learned earlier, and they learn important practical applications of geometry. With mastery of the Year 1 and Year 2 courses, students will be prepared for further mathematical education and for understanding deeper connections between abstract mathematics and real world situations.\n\nThe course begins with polynomial and exponetial functions, with emphasis on quadratics.\nThe focus of the course is the development of logic and reasoning, along with basic ways to think geometrically. The two foci for the Year 2 course are formal reasoning and applications of geometry (constructions, calculating lengths, areas, and volumes). Geometric constructions should be woven through the course. Appropriate use of technology is encouraged to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nPrerequisite to this course is working knowledge of key topics from years one and two, including number line and interval notation, solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities, and absolute value and distance. The thrust of the Year 3 course is to reinforce and extend the algebraic topics from Year 1 and Year 2 courses.\nThroughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics. Students should use graphing calculators and other technology as integral parts of the course to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nWith the advent of the core requirements for Ohio, all students must take mathematics inThis course presents a mix of algebraic and geometric topics that will help develop students' algebraic thinking. Throughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics. Mastery of the four courses in this model will provide students with the mathematical and reasoning skills needed to succeed in a rigorous college-level calculus course.\n\nThe Year 4 course has several focus areas: (1) formal proofs by induction with applications, (2) modeling bivariate data, and (3) trigonometry. By studying these topics, the student will have completed a comprehensive high school curriculum. Students may use graphing calculators and other technology to enhance the study of these topics.\n\nOne purpose of secondary education in the United States has always been preparing\nstudents for their roles as citizens, as well as preparing them for future study\nand the workplace. Today numbers and data are critical parts of public and private\ndecision making. Decisions about health care, finances, science policy, and the\nenvironment are decisions that require citizens to understand information presented\nin numerical form, in tables, diagrams, and graphs. Students must develop skills\nto analyze complex issues using quantitative tools.\n\nThis course prepares students to investigate contemporary issues mathematically\nand to apply the mathematics learned in earlier courses to answer questions that\nare relevant to their civic and personal lives. The course reinforces student understanding\nof:\n\nfunctions and their graphs\n\nThis course also introduces functions of two variables and graphs in three dimensions.\nThe applications in all sections should provide an opportunity for deeper understanding\nand extension of the material from earlier courses. This course should also show\nthe connections between different mathematics topics and between the mathematics\nand the areas in which applied.\n\nStudents must also\nbe expected to communicate mathematical ideas using formal mathematical language.\nTeachers in schools adopting Model C will benefit from professional development\nthat includes strategies for successfully teaching all students and that familiarizes\nteachers with sources of problems to deepen student understanding of mathematical\ntopics.\n\nThis model provides students with the basic mathematical knowledge they will need\nfor future education and employment\n\nThis adaptation prepares students for OGT requirements by the end of the second year course and meets the Ohio Board of Regents expectations for students to be prepared for a non-remedial college mathematics course by the end of the third year course.\n\nFirst Year Course\n\nFirst Year Course Rationale\n\nAll students require a rigorous and demanding curriculum in order to develop sound reasoning and strong problem solving skills\n\nStudents progress from their informal middle school experience with number relationships, data analysis, and linear equations to more formal definitions, algebraic reasoning, and graphical representations\n\nWith this model, as with any model, different students may require different amounts of time and support to become proficient with the mathematics.\n\nFirst Year Course Description\n\nThe focus of this course is the development of algebraic understanding, reasoning, and skills using mathematical language to express abstract ideas\n\nThe Year 1 course has four main themes:\n\ntransition from generalized arithmetic to algebra;\n\ndata analysis and probability;\n\nlinear equations and functions;\n\nnonlinear functions (introduction)\n\nMore specifically, students will solve linear equations and inequalities and systems\nof equations\n\nAlgebraic topics are a focus and are developed in relationship to the geometry and mathematical reasoning the students have previously studied.\n\nThird Year Course Description\n\nPrerequisite to this course is working knowledge of key topics from years one and two, including number line and interval notation, solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities, and absolute value and distance\n\nThe thrust of the Year 3 course is to reinforce and extend the algebraic topics from Year 1 and Year 2 courses.\nThroughout this course, students should have frequent experiences with numeric, graphical, algebraic, and verbal examples of mathematics\n\nDecisions about health care, finances, science policy, and the\nenvironment are decisions that require citizens to understand information presented\nin numerical form, in tables, diagrams, and graphs\n\nStudents must develop skills\nto analyze complex issues using quantitative tools.\n\nIn addition to a textbook, teachers will want to use online resources, newspapers,\nand magazines to identify problems that are appropriate for the course\n\nThe course reinforces student understanding\nof:\n\npercent\n\nfunctions and their graphs\n\nprobability and statistics\n\nmultiple representations of data and data analysis\n\nThis course also introduces functions of two variables and graphs in three dimensions.\nThe applications in all sections should provide an opportunity for deeper understanding\nand extension of the material from earlier courses", "programming_score": 23.261015432789083, "segments_extracted": 26, "original_length": 8942, "compressed_length": 9701}

Although I agree that is a subset of the purpose of an algebra class, that still leaves a lot of gaps in between those (finite number of) techniques taught in an algebra class and the only way to fill those gaps is that the student also develop the skill to invent new solutions without prior art.

Currently I'm studying computer science, and I'm interested in looking into statistical and optimization applications, as well as theory (yeah, I know that sound broad, but I'm quite early in my education!). Anyways, I want to get deep into the math behind these things - statistics, combinatorics, linear and integer programming, maybe some analysis.

Understanding delta-epsilon proofs was a big obstacle for calculus back in high school, and more recently generating functions have been giving me serious trouble.</p>\n<p>If I pursue a path towards graduate level studies, what sort of things should I watch out for?

Most mathematicians I know aren't working on problems they would have expected when they arrived in grad school. It takes a surprisingly long time for most people to reach the level of mathematical maturity where they're reading to work on new problems, and until you have an inkling that you're ready for this, don't overspecialise.

There is so much out there that even the best mathematicians are limited in what they can understand well. So in terms of specific concept plateaus, well if you're like most of us you'll probably have lots of them, and that's a good thing.</p>\n<p>In terms of concepts, I think what I found tough was often much clearer after I lost an early misconception. E.g. for a long time I thought the Killing form in Lie algebra was using \"killing\" as a synonym for \"erasing\"... I tried to build my understanding around that conception and it didn't work very well (Killing is a name). A lot of \"simple\" mathematical ideas are known by proper names rather than descriptive terms, so as more of these accumulate you have to rely more on memorization than intuition.</p>\n<p>Outside of concepts, here's what I found tough:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transition from coursework to research.</strong> Some people are very good at getting the A when the material is put in front of them, and most textbooks are good at giving you the necessary tools to solve the problems they present.

{"text": "Instructional\nprograms from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students\nto—\n\nA wide variety of representations can be seen in the examples in this chapter.\nBy using various representations for the \"counting rectangles\" problem\nin the \"Problem Solving\" section, students could find different solutions\nand compare them. The use of algebraic symbolism to explain a striking\ngraphical phenomenon is central to the \"string traversing tiles\" task\nin the \"Communication\" section. Representations facilitate reasoning and\nare the tools of proof: they are used to examine statistical relationships\nand to establish the validity of a builder's shortcut. They are at the\ncore of communication and support the development of understanding in\nMarta's and Nancy's work on the \"string traversing tiles\" problem. Although\nat one level the story of Mr. Robinson's class is about connections, at\nanother level it is about representation: one group of students places\ncoordinates that \"make things eeeasy,\" the class gains insights from dynamic\nrepresentations of geometric objects, and the students produce proofs\nin coordinate and Euclidean geometry. A major lesson of that story is\nthat different representations support different ways of thinking about\nand manipulating mathematical objects. An object can be better understood\nwhen viewed through multiple lenses. »\n\nIn grades 9–12, students' knowledge and use of representations should\nexpand in scope and complexity. As they study new content, for example,\nstudents will encounter many new representations for mathematical concepts.\nThey will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations.\nMuch of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate\non objects from different perspectives.\n\nIn elementary school, students most often use representations to reason about\nobjects and actions they can perceive directly. In the middle grades,\nstudents increasingly create and use mathematical representations for\nobjects that are not perceived directly, such as rational numbers or rates.\nBy high school, students are working with such increasingly abstract entities\nas functions, matrices, and equations. Using various representations of\nthese objects, students should be able to recognize common mathematical\nstructures across different contexts. For example, the sum of the first\nn odd natural numbers, the areas of square gardens, and the\ndistance traveled by a vehicle that starts at rest and accelerates at\na constant rate can be represented by functions of the form f(x) = ax2.\nThe fact that these situations can be represented by the same class of\nfunctions implies that they are alike in some fundamental mathematical\nway. Students are ready in high school to see similarity in the underlying\nstructure of mathematical objects that appear contextually different but\nwhose representations look quite similar.\n\nHigh school students should be able to create and interpret models of more-complex\nphenomena, drawn from a wider range of contexts, by identifying essential\nfeatures of a situation and by finding representations that capture mathematical\nrelationships among those features. They should recognize, for example,\nthat phenomena with periodic features often are best modeled by trigonometric\nfunctions and that population growth tends to be exponential, or logistic.\nThey will learn » to describe some real-world\nphenomena with iterative and recursive representations.\n\nConsider the graph of the concentration of CO2\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude during the period\nfrom 1986 through 1991 (see fig. 7.39) (Sarmiento 1993). Teachers might\nuse an example such as this to help students understand and interpret\nseveral aspects of representation. Students could discuss the trends in\nthe change in concentration of CO2 as\na function of time as well as latitude. Doing so would draw on their knowledge\nabout classes of functions and their ability to interpret three-dimensional\ngraphs. They should be able to see a roughly linear increase across time,\ncoupled with a sinusoidal fluctuation with the seasons. Focusing on the\nchange in the character of the graph as a function of latitude, students\nshould note that the amplitude of the sinusoidal function lessens from\nnorth to south. Students can test whether the trends they observe in the\ngraph correspond to recent theoretical work on CO2\nconcentration in the atmosphere. For example, the author of the article\nattributes the sinusoidal fluctuation to seasonal variations in the amount\nof photosynthesis taking place in the terrestrial biosphere. Students\ncould discuss the differences in amplitude across seasons in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres.\n\nFig. 7.39. A three-dimensional graph\nof the concentration of C02\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude (Adapted\nfrom Sarmiento [1993])\n\nElectronic technologies\nprovide access to problems and methods that until recently were difficult\nto explore meaningfully in high school. In order to use the technologies\neffectively, students will need to become familiar with the representations\ncommonly used in technological settings. For example, solving equations\nor multiplying matrices using a computer algebra system calls for learning\nhow to input and interpret information in formats used by the system.\nMany software tools that students might use include special icons and\nsymbols that carry particular meaning or are needed to operate the tool;\nstudents will need to learn about these representations and distinguish\nthem from the mathematical objects they are manipulating.\n\nAn important part of learning mathematics is learning to use the language, conventions,\nand representations of mathematics. Teachers should introduce students\nto conventional mathematical representations »\nand help them use those representations effectively by building\non the students' personal and idiosyncratic representations when necessary.\nIt is important for teachers to highlight ways in which different representations\nof the same objects can convey different information and to emphasize\nthe importance of selecting representations suited to the particular mathematical\ntasks at hand (Yerushalmy and Schwartz 1993; Moschkovich, Schoenfeld,\nand Arcavi 1993). For example, tables of values are often useful for quick\nreference, but they provide little information about the nature of the\nfunction represented. Consider the table in the \"Algebra\" section in this\nchapter that gives the number of minutes of daylight in Chicago every\nother day for the year 2000. The values in the table suggest that the\nfunction is initially increasing and then becomes decreasing. Knowledge\nof the context of a graph of those values suggests that the behavior is\nactually periodic. Similarly, algebraic and graphical representations\nof functions may provide different information. Some global properties\nof functions, such as asymptotic behavior or the rate of growth of a function,\nare often most readily apparent from graphs. But information about specific\naspects of a function—the exact value of f() or exact values of\nx where f(x)has a maximum or a minimum—may best\nbe determined using an algebraic representation of the function. Suppose\ng(x) is given by the equation g(x) = f(x)\n+ 1, for all x. The analytic definitions of f(x) and\ng(x) may offer the most-effective ways of computing specific\nvalues of f(x) and g(x), but graphing the function\nreveals that the \"shape\" of g(x) is precisely the same as that\nof f(x)—that the graph of g(x) is obtained by\ntranslating the graph of f(x) one unit upward.\n\nAs in all instruction, what matters is what the student sees, hears, and understands.\nOften, students interpret what teachers may consider wonderfully lucid\npresentations in ways that are very different from those their teachers\nintended (Confrey 1990; Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle 1993). Or they may\ninvent representations of content that are idiosyncratic and have personal\nmeaning but do not look at all like conventional mathematical representations\n(Confrey, 1991; Hall et al. 1989). Part of the teacher's role\nis to help students connect their personal images to more-conventional\nrepresentations. One very useful window into students' thinking is student-generated\nrepresentations. To illustrate this point, consider the following problem\n(adapted from Hughes-Hallett et al. [1994, p. 6]) that might be presented\nto a tenth-grade class:\n\nA flight from SeaTac Airport near Seattle, Washington, to LAX Airport\nin Los Angeles has to circle LAX several times before being allowed\nto land. Plot a graph of the distance of the plane from Seattle against\ntime from the moment of takeoff until landing.\n\nStudents could work individually or in pairs to produce distance-versus-time\ngraphs for this problem, and teachers could ask them to present and defend\nthose graphs to their classmates. Graphs produced by this class, or perhaps\nby students in other classes, could be handed out for careful critique\nand comment. When they perform critiques, students get a considerable\namount of practice in communicating mathematics as well as in constructing\nand improving on representations, and the teacher gets information that\ncan be helpful in assessment.

A more nearly accurate\nrepresentation of the airplane's distance from its take-off\npoint against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nRepresentation Standard\nfor Grades 9–12\n\nInstructional\nprograms from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students\nto—\n\ncreate and use representations to organize, record, and communicate\nmathematical ideas;\n\nselect, apply, and translate among mathematical representations\nto solve problems;\n\nuse representations to model and interpret physical, social,\nand mathematical phenomena.\n\nIf mathematics is the \"science of patterns\" (Steen 1988), representations are\nthe means by which those patterns are recorded and analyzed\n\nThe various methods for representing\ndata sets further demonstrate the centrality of this topic.\n\np.\n360\n\nA wide variety of representations can be seen in the examples in this chapter.\nBy using various representations for the \"counting rectangles\" problem\nin the \"Problem Solving\" section, students could find different solutions\nand compare them\n\nRobinson's class is about connections, at\nanother level it is about representation: one group of students places\ncoordinates that \"make things eeeasy,\" the class gains insights from dynamic\nrepresentations of geometric objects, and the students produce proofs\nin coordinate and Euclidean geometry\n\nAs they study new content, for example,\nstudents will encounter many new representations for mathematical concepts.\nThey will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations.\nMuch of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate\non objects from different perspectives.\n\nIn elementary school, students most often use representations to reason about\nobjects and actions they can perceive directly\n\nUsing various representations of\nthese objects, students should be able to recognize common mathematical\nstructures across different contexts\n\nStudents are ready in high school to see similarity in the underlying\nstructure of mathematical objects that appear contextually different but\nwhose representations look quite similar.\n\np.\n361\n\nHigh school students should be able to create and interpret models of more-complex\nphenomena, drawn from a wider range of contexts, by identifying essential\nfeatures of a situation and by finding representations that capture mathematical\nrelationships among those features\n\nThey should recognize, for example,\nthat phenomena with periodic features often are best modeled by trigonometric\nfunctions and that population growth tends to be exponential, or logistic.\nThey will learn » to describe some real-world\nphenomena with iterative and recursive representations.\n\nConsider the graph of the concentration of CO2\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude during the period\nfrom 1986 through 1991 (see fig\n\nFocusing on the\nchange in the character of the graph as a function of latitude, students\nshould note that the amplitude of the sinusoidal function lessens from\nnorth to south\n\nA three-dimensional graph\nof the concentration of C02\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude (Adapted\nfrom Sarmiento [1993])\n\nElectronic technologies\nprovide access to problems and methods that until recently were difficult\nto explore meaningfully in high school\n\nFor example, solving equations\nor multiplying matrices using a computer algebra system calls for learning\nhow to input and interpret information in formats used by the system.\nMany software tools that students might use include special icons and\nsymbols that carry particular meaning or are needed to operate the tool;\nstudents will need to learn about these representations and distinguish\nthem from the mathematical objects they are manipulating.\n\nWhat should be the teacher's role in developing representation in grades\n9 through 12?\n\np.\n362\n\nAn important part of learning mathematics is learning to use the language, conventions,\nand representations of mathematics\n\nSome global properties\nof functions, such as asymptotic behavior or the rate of growth of a function,\nare often most readily apparent from graphs\n\nBut information about specific\naspects of a function—the exact value of f() or exact values of\nx where f(x)has a maximum or a minimum—may best\nbe determined using an algebraic representation of the function\n\nThe analytic definitions of f(x) and\ng(x) may offer the most-effective ways of computing specific\nvalues of f(x) and g(x), but graphing the function\nreveals that the \"shape\" of g(x) is precisely the same as that\nof f(x)—that the graph of g(x) is obtained by\ntranslating the graph of f(x) one unit upward.\n\nAs in all instruction, what matters is what the student sees, hears, and understands.\nOften, students interpret what teachers may consider wonderfully lucid\npresentations in ways that are very different from those their teachers\nintended (Confrey 1990; Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle 1993)\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider the following problem\n(adapted from Hughes-Hallett et al\n\n6]) that might be presented\nto a tenth-grade class:\n\nA flight from SeaTac Airport near Seattle, Washington, to LAX Airport\nin Los Angeles has to circle LAX several times before being allowed\nto land\n\nPlot a graph of the distance of the plane from Seattle against\ntime from the moment of takeoff until landing.\n\np.\n363\n\nStudents could work individually or in pairs to produce distance-versus-time\ngraphs for this problem, and teachers could ask them to present and defend\nthose graphs to their classmates\n\nWhen they perform critiques, students get a considerable\namount of practice in communicating mathematics as well as in constructing\nand improving on representations, and the teacher gets information that\ncan be helpful in assessment\n\nA representation that\na student might produce of an airplane's distance from\nits take-off point against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nThis representation indicates a number of interesting and not uncommon misunderstandings,\nin which literal features of the story (the plane flying at constant height\nor circling around the airport) are converted inappropriately into features\nof the graph (Dugdale 1993; Leinhardt, Zaslavsky, and Stein 1990).\nRepresentations of this type can provoke interesting classroom conversations,\nrevealing what the students really understand about graphing\n\nA more nearly accurate\nrepresentation of the airplane's distance from its take-off\npoint against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nMathematics is one of humankind's greatest cultural achievements", "programming_score": 30.563131718273706, "segments_extracted": 33, "original_length": 12466, "compressed_length": 16001}
{"text": "So I currently teach a precalc class and new this year we are required to teach conic section.\nWe cover parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Since I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it? The book we use has a bunch of formulas, but I'm looking for a way to teach it to my students without using all the formulas so they don't have to memorize a bunch of formulas before their exam. What has worked for others?\n\nYou should be able to design good lessons directly based on the book sections. As long as you use a Pre-Calculus book you will have rich enough information available.\n\nBe sure to demonstrate the conic sections using a realistic three-dimensional model. Also use the definitions of each conic section and the distance formula to derive the equation for each conic section, and include the analytical cartesian graph for each.\n\nYou are right on-target about not just giving a bunch of formulas. The demonstration and the derivations are important for learning and understanding.\n\nAs a student who struggled through conic sections, I found that by exploring how they were really just variations of the of the same things cemented my understanding of the topic. So if I were in your shoes I would try to show the similarities and differences of the different sections. Specifically between the hyperbola and parabola and the circle and ellipse.\n\nAs someone who not long ago learnt Conic Sections, I found the derivations of the formula much easier than remembering them. It was good to see the formulas at first but I much preferred the derivations.\n\nI was definitely going to derive the formulas using the distance formula and talk about applications. I wouldn't scratch formulas altogether, but our book has like 8 different formulas, which isn't fair to give all of them to my students if I don't give them on an exam.\n\nSomething one of my physics professors said to our class is recalled to me by this thread. He said students of today are so used to tv games, comics, etc. rather than playing with things with their hands, that they can't visualize 3d objects anymore. He was of course exaggerating. I think it quite odd if a student can't visualize what's going on with conic sections, so yes a model would be quite good. Maybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.\n\nAlso, the old books on geometry, particularly solid geometry, should be good with conic sections, so maybe go down to the library and have a look at them.\n\nAh yes, I have a fun experiment using that! You should certainly teach that!\n\nHere it goes: Dandelin was a Belgian, and some people decided to celebrate him. So what they did was the following. They made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone). And they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone. Then they would sell it to people.I always tought that it was very clever, and it was quite the financial succes too!did they then discover another, smaller, ice-cream (just like discovering another layer of chocolates when you finish the first layer!), which touched the other focus on the other side of the biscuit?\n\nSince I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it?

{"text": "Welcome to Calculus! This semester will be a\nchallenging one for you, but hopefully, with my suggestions, you will be able\nto successfully get through this class!\n\nIn order to succeed, you will have to know some\nthings even before you walk into your Calculus classroom on the first\nday. First off, sit towards the front. If you do this, you will be\nforced to pay attention. Secondly, make sure you get to know the people\nthat sit around you. If you are outgoing, strive to know the majority of\nthe people in the class. This will make class time more enjoyable for you\nbut will also help you with your grades. If you have trouble with\nsomething, you will have a peer to ask for help out of class. Lastly,\nwhen your professor gives you the syllabus for the semester, start right\naway! Start to do some of the assigned problems. If they don't make\nany sense to you, at least read the material you will be going over in class\nthe next day thouroughly.\n\nThere have been many things that I have discovered\nover the course of the semester that could be of value to you. First,\nalways keep up with your assignments. Have your assignment done so that\nyou can follow along when your professor lectures about the topic. Some\nof the assigned problems will be difficult and you will not be able to\nunderstand them. When this comes up, make sure that you ask\nquestions. The best way is to ask questions while in class. If\nclass time runs out, do not just forget about the problems you had on the\nassignment, go in and ask your professor during his/her office hours. In\naddition to doing your assignments, take your own notes from the book.\nThis will help you to understand topics covered in lecture better. For\nme, this technique really worked. Once I began to take my own notes in addition\nto the notes I took from my professor's lecture, I did a lot better, especially\non my weekly quizzes. Lastly, everyone messes up sometimes. If you\nget a bad grade on a quiz or an exam, make sure you know all the mistakes you\nmade and why. Chances are, you will see problems that you had trouble\nwith on comprehensive tests. Learn from your mistakes, and you will do\nbetter the next time you have the opportunity.\n\nI hope some of my suggestions help you during your\nsemester in Calculus.
