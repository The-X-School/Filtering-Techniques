{"text": "Book summary\n\nThe text presents a circular function approach to trigonometry by demonstrating connections between the familiar algebra and the new language of trigonometry. This method-along with foreshadowing-is used throughout the text to provide students with a comfortable base for learning something new from something old or familiar. With just a few connections to algebra, students have the tools to understand the circular functions, their domains and ranges, and the relationship between the circular functions and the functional values. The approach immediately launches the student into the concept of periodic functions, their applications, graphs, and use in modeling many periodic phenomena. Beginning with this approach provides the student with a common thread that can be used to discover, connect and understand the remaining concepts of trigonometry. [via]"}

I find that the definitions of key terms are buried in the text, like the definition of a basic solution on p. 95. The description of the simplex algorithm in section 2.1 is mixed together with a particular linear programming problem. I would prefer to have a general description and then many detailed examples, rather than a mix of both and then only two examples. I have a similar complaint with section 2.3 on the two phase method.\n\nThis book is expensive. There are books published by Dover that cover the simplex algorithm, duality, and integer programming that cost a tenth as much as this book, and an instructor should look at those before assigning a book that costs this much. Also, it is ludicrous now to have newly purchased books come with floppy disks.\n\nA good book\n\nBy Bryan Urizar - December 19, 2010\n\nThis is a good book. Everything is well explained and each section has many examples. The only thing I would complain about is that the examples should probably have been placed before the theorem statement/proof as it would help the reader understand the proof. The material is all very straightforward and shouldn't cause any headaches. Overall an excellent book which I'd recommend to anyone who would like to learn linear programming.\n\nFor anyone trying to learn linear programming out a class room setting it is also good as the back has answers to odd numbered questions."}
{"text": "Solving single variable equations in the algebra classroom\n\nThis report recognizes the common mistakes students make solving single variable equations and attempts to connect these errors to varying levels of developmental readiness. Striving to meet the needs of all students, this report offers an alternative to lecture based mathematics lessons by exploring the benefits of a unit based curriculum. The unit poses an overarching problem for the students to investigate and answer, while the students still receive the instruction on solving algebraic equations. The goal is to move beyond traditional procedures when solving equations to help students become more familiar with symbol manipulation involved in solving real world story problems."}

Therefore, a wide variety of unique, data-based, contemporary applications are included in nearly every section.\n\nMaking Connections: This feature points out how concepts presented throughout the course are interrelated. It also provides students with a perspective on how previously learned material applies to the new material they have learned.\n\nChecking Basic Concepts: This feature consists of a small set of exercises provided after every two sections. These exercises can be used by students for review purposes, or by the instructor as group activities. They require 10-15 minutes to complete and could be used during class if time is available.\n\nEnd of Chapter Material: Each chapter ends with a summary of key concepts, review exercises, and extended and discovery exercises.\n\nChapter R Reference: Basic Concepts from Algebra and Geometry: This contains much of the material from intermediate algebra and basic geometry in a separate appendix at the back of the text.

Engineers and scientists frequently encounter linear and nonlinear mathematical equa- tions, integrals, differential equations, and data to be manipulated. Sometimes the ma- nipulations to be performed are easy and straightforward; often they are not. This is particularly true of nonlinear problems, that is, problems in which variables occur as products, including products of themselves, or as functions of transcendental functions, like the trigonometric or logarithmic relations. If the mathematics to be performed can- not be done in closed form (i.e., an exact analytic symbolic solution is obtained), recourse must be made to numerical approximations. Fortunately, these methods, when properly understood and used, are powerful and accurate. It should be understood that recourse to a numerical solution is always a fall-"}

Various programming paradigms are explained in a uniform manner, with fully worked out examples that are useful tools in their own right. The floppy disk contains numerous Mathematica notebooks and packages, valuable tools for applying each of the methods discussed. [via]\n\nPhysics and computer science genius Stephen Wolfram, whose Mathematica computer language launched a multimillion-dollar company, now sets his sights on a more daunting goal: understanding the universe. A New Kind of Science is a gorgeous, 1,280-page tome more than a decade in the making. With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modelling complex systems.\n\nOn the frontier of complexity science since he was a boy, Wolfram is a champion of cellular automata--256 \"programs\" governed by simple non-mathematical rules. He points out that even the most complex equations fail to accurately model biological systems, but the simplest cellular automata can produce results straight out of nature--tree branches, stream eddies, and leopard spots, for instance. The graphics in A New Kind of Science show striking resemblance to the patterns we see in nature every day.\n\nWolfram wrote the book in a distinct style meant to make it easy to read, even for non-techies; a basic familiarity with logic is helpful but not essential. Readers will find themselves swept away by the elegant simplicity of Wolfram's ideas and the accidental artistry of the cellular automaton models. Whether or not Wolfram's revolution ultimately gives us the keys to the universe, his new science is absolutely awe-inspiring. --Therese Littleton[via]"}

{"text": "The chapter begins with an exploratory problem designed to introduce the concept of linear programming with an objective function to maximize profits by optimizing a company's product mix. The problem context involves assembling two types of computers with different profit margins and labor requirements. Students are led through a graphical solution to a two decision variable problem involving two constraints.The second product mix example involves a detailed totally worked-out example involving the manufacture of skateboards. Students are shown step-by-step how to formulate and solve this two decision variable problem graphically. A third decision variable is then added to motivate the need for EXCEL to solve larger problems. Students are taught how to use SOLVER as standard add-in to EXCEL to solve linear programming problems. This section also discusses how to use the linear programming output to perform sensitivity analysis. There is also an optional section that discusses the Simplex algorithm that is the basis for computational solution of LP problems. The third example is a sports shoe company and focuses on interpretation of results. The text presents a fully formulated and solved problem involving six decision variables and six constraints. The emphasis is on interpreting the output from SOLVER and answering a variety of what-if questions.\n\nBinary programming is a form of integer programming. The word \"binary\" refers to the decision variables. When decision variables are binary, this means that they can only take on the values of either 0 or 1. That might seem overly restrictive, but there are many situations that can easily be modeled using binary decision variables. For example, the following decisions could be modeled with binary decision variables:\n- Should we located a new automobile dealership at this location?\n- Should I choose to apply to this college?\n- Should I invest in this stock?\n\nWe all make decisions everyday in our lives that involve uncertainty. Decision Trees is the first chapter in the Probabilistic material and introduces the concept of making decisions under uncertainty and risk. The decision tree methodology involves accounting for every possible decision and random event. The best alternative generally maximizes the expected value of profit or minimized the expected cost, however, other non-financial variables are also considered. Expected value does not also capture an individual's risk tolerance. This risk aversion is the foundation for the insurance industry. The final problem in this chapter follows Jee Min a high school junior as he tries to determine how much collision insurance he needs."}

{"text": "\"The best Algebra tutorial program I have seen... in a class by itself.\" Macworld\n\nWe start with a word problem one would never have to solve in life. Super. The answer is 2n so I choose n/2 to see what happens. The software says \"Incorrect\" in red, does not offer the correct answer, and simply encourages me to go on to the next slide. Very helpful. I hit Next.\n\nEventually we get to play with two helicopters to solve x/2 - 3 = 1. I found myself wondering where the two expressions came from and what a helicopter would be doing hovering at x/2 - 3, but I was always a troublemaker in school. Nowhere does the software talk about needing to keep the two helicoptesr at the same altitude, let alone why we have to. Me, I like see-saws which are level when the two sides are the same, just as we want to preserve an equation's truth as we transform it. Anyway...\n\nClicking +3 on the first guy moves it up but leaves the expression as x/2 - 3. It should have changed to x/2, the way the other guy changed from 1 to 4 when I clicked +3. Clicking x2 (meaning multiply, not the variable x) finally changes the first guy to x. The other guy continues to work and becomes 8.\n\nNow the material simply goes wrong, saying we have to add before we multiply. No, that just makes it easier. And it gets worse: the text says that if we multiply by 2 first we will end up with the wrong answer, x=5. Nonsense, as the graphic shows: we end up with x - 3 = 5, what it calls \"an incomplete solution\". Thought one: well then it is not a solution! Add 3 to both sides!! And how on Earth did we get to x-3=5? By going x/2-3=1 to 2(x/2-3)=2*1 to x-6=2 to x-6+3=2+3. Right, they accepted as inevitable the two operations of adding at most 3 and multiplying by at most 3, with nothing else permitted. Hunh?\n\nJust this little bit of material is wrong in one place, inconsistent with itself, confusing, unmotivating, and plain leaves out the fundamental concept of preserving the truth of the equation as necessary. On-line and interactive is only as good as the underlying fundamental material, and in that regard Monterey comes up short.\n\nA blow-by-blow replay of a disappointing on-line Algebra experience at the Monterey Institute."}

{"text": "Could you suggest me a good TI calculator?\n\nCould you suggest me a good TI calculator?\n\ni have decided to buy a good TI calculator. The cost isn't really a factor.. since almost all of their calculators come under 349 USD.\n\nMy area of work is mostly calculus-based physics and analytical geometry [coordinate geometry]. In mathematics, i'd also be needing features for basic basic statistics and probability computation.\n\nAdvanced algebraic support and data visualization is a must in addition to vector algebra and vector calculus. From what I saw at their site, one of the Graphing calculators would be a good option with me, because I deal with a lot of function plots and data visualization. And since programming is one of my hobbies, I'd also need a programmable calculator which can be programmed with the TIGCC library.\n\nAnd since i already have Mathematica with me and do most of my stuff with that.. the only reason i want a calculator is for portability [a laptop is gonna cost a lot more :P].. so the smaller the better.\n\nAlso.. is there any calculator which has some specific set of functions for chemistry based applications?\n\nI would strongly suggest the TI-89. It can simplify algebraic expressions, do basic (and a few not-so-basic) integrals, and some other useful stuff. It won't substitute for your physics knowledge. But my good ol' 89 saved me on my PhD qualifier (no seriously, I would have failed if not for its diff eq solver), so I'd recommend it to practically anyone in the physical sciences.\n\nIn regards to vector algebra, it can do dot and cross products. It can allegedly also do coordinate transformations, though I've never dared to actually try this. It can also do vector calculus...sort of. You'll need to turn double, triple, line, and surface integrals into iterated integrals by hand. But once you have it in this form, you can plug it into the 89 and get an expression. Not sure what you mean by data visualization, but it can graph continuous functions and sequences. As for programming, I don't know what the TIGCC library is, but the 89 has some sort of programming language. I've seen people write some pretty impressive programs for the 89. It can even play Super Mario. Not that you want to use your calculator for games, but if it can do this, then I'm sure it can do some pretty useful mathematical applications.\n\nthanks a lot for the reply.. even i was thinking of the TI-89 since it's quite a popular model. But.. what do you think about the Voyage 200 or the TI-92 series? The only reason i didn't want to go for it was that it might be bulky and as i said.. portability was a major concern in my case. It's photographs hardly give me an idea of what it's real life size is..\n\nI do know that the Voyage 200 qualifies as a computer and is not allowed in SAT exams and stuff.. but the exams that i have to give in india don't allow any calculator at all.. so it doesn't really matter to me."}

Most of the discussion is restricted to two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space, though sometimes more general results and problems are given. Thus even the mathematically unsophisticated reader can grasp some of the results of a branch of twentieth-century mathematics that has applications in such disciplines as mathematical programming, operations research and theoretical computer science. At the end of the book the authors have collected together a set of unsolved and partially solved problems that a sixth-form student should be able to understand and even attempt to solve. less"}

{"text": "Could you suggest me a good TI calculator?\n\nCould you suggest me a good TI calculator?\n\ni have decided to buy a good TI calculator. The cost isn't really a factor.. since almost all of their calculators come under 349 USD.\n\nMy area of work is mostly calculus-based physics and analytical geometry [coordinate geometry]. In mathematics, i'd also be needing features for basic basic statistics and probability computation.\n\nAdvanced algebraic support and data visualization is a must in addition to vector algebra and vector calculus. From what I saw at their site, one of the Graphing calculators would be a good option with me, because I deal with a lot of function plots and data visualization. And since programming is one of my hobbies, I'd also need a programmable calculator which can be programmed with the TIGCC library.\n\nAnd since i already have Mathematica with me and do most of my stuff with that.. the only reason i want a calculator is for portability [a laptop is gonna cost a lot more :P].. so the smaller the better.\n\nAlso.. is there any calculator which has some specific set of functions for chemistry based applications?\n\nI would strongly suggest the TI-89. It can simplify algebraic expressions, do basic (and a few not-so-basic) integrals, and some other useful stuff. It won't substitute for your physics knowledge. But my good ol' 89 saved me on my PhD qualifier (no seriously, I would have failed if not for its diff eq solver), so I'd recommend it to practically anyone in the physical sciences.\n\nIn regards to vector algebra, it can do dot and cross products. It can allegedly also do coordinate transformations, though I've never dared to actually try this. It can also do vector calculus...sort of. You'll need to turn double, triple, line, and surface integrals into iterated integrals by hand. But once you have it in this form, you can plug it into the 89 and get an expression. Not sure what you mean by data visualization, but it can graph continuous functions and sequences. As for programming, I don't know what the TIGCC library is, but the 89 has some sort of programming language. I've seen people write some pretty impressive programs for the 89. It can even play Super Mario. Not that you want to use your calculator for games, but if it can do this, then I'm sure it can do some pretty useful mathematical applications.\n\nthanks a lot for the reply.. even i was thinking of the TI-89 since it's quite a popular model. But.. what do you think about the Voyage 200 or the TI-92 series? The only reason i didn't want to go for it was that it might be bulky and as i said.. portability was a major concern in my case. It's photographs hardly give me an idea of what it's real life size is..\n\nI do know that the Voyage 200 qualifies as a computer and is not allowed in SAT exams and stuff.. but the exams that i have to give in india don't allow any calculator at all.. so it doesn't really matter to me."}

{"text": "Of course, problem-solving is a major activity in any mathematics\ncourse. A sound approach to the problem-solving process is a\nnecessity for mathematics students. The approach outlined here is\nessentially the one from the classic book on the subject, How To\nSolve It by George Pólya1.\n\nThe first step is understanding the problem. The student must be\nable to state what needs to be solved, and what supporting conditions\nare given as information to be used in solving the problem. Once these\nare understood, it can be helpful (when possible) to draw a picture\nrepresenting the unknown quantity to be solved and the other given\ninformation. If the unknown quantities are given in verbal form, it is\nnecessary to introduce a suitable notation for these variables, and\nfor the given conditions. Once we understand what we are given, and\nwhat we are looking for, we can proceed to the next step.\n\nWe need to devise a plan for the solution of the problem. This plan\nshould arise from a connection between the given information and the\nunknown. If an immediate connection isn't apparent, the student may\nhave to explore other auxiliary connections to develop a chain which\nwill link the given information to the unknown.\n\nOnce a plan has been developed, the student must carry it out. It is\nespecially important to check the validity and the accuracy of each\nstep in the plan.\n\nFinally, the student should look back on the solution obtained and\nexamine it. This means checking the work, and also stepping back to\nget an overview of the entire process. The solution to this problem\nthen becomes part of the student's problem-solving library, which\nshould be available for application to similar problems in the future."}

In the previous lesson, students learned to multiply and divide rational expressions.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nLearning Goals. The overall learning goal is to have students be able to add and subtract rational expressions. Students will first combine expressions with common denominators, then find a common denominator to combine expressions with unlike denominators. Long-term goals not directly assessed by the lesson are to ease anxiety when dealing with fractions and to have students realize the connection between adding/subtracting rational numbers and adding/subtracting rational expressions.\n\nLesson Design. The lesson reviewed addition and subtraction of fractions, demonstrated addition and subtraction of simple rational expressions, and worked up to difficult examples. The lesson began with three examples of rational numbers, one with common denominators and two with un-like denominators, followed by rational expressions with common denominators. Examples of rational expressions with un-like denominators started out simple and increased in difficulty level. The number of expressions to be added increased along with the difficulty in the factorization of the denominators. The examples were chosen so that the answers could be rewritten in reduced forms at the end to remind students to check that final step in their answers. Due to the anxiety that this lesson has caused in the past, hard examples were presented by the end so that students could be exposed to more difficult problems.\n\nMajor findings about student learning. The findings showed that even though students were successful at the beginning problems in the homework, they were intimidated by the \"difficult look\" of the later homework problems and simply did not attempt them. This was evident in the analysis of the homework where the amount of incomplete problems drastically increased at a certain problem when the difficulty level was higher. In the revised lesson, more difficult examples were used, and it was stressed that the steps remain the same even though it looked much harder than previous examples. Several days later when the students had to use the lesson to solve equations involving rational expressions their confidence level was greater and the majority of students got the correct answers."}

{"text": "Solving Equations DVD Sample Track\n\nThe ability to solve equations is a foundation of algebraic instruction and algebraic thinking. The student who is able to demonstrate a mastery of this skill is well on the way to success in understanding algebra and achieving success in higher mathematics courses. In this video, Brad and I will show you how we have presented this concept successfully in our own middle and high school classes. Our students have exhibited a high level of mastery of this concept both in their conceptual understanding and their computational expertise.\n\nBrad and I begin our instruction in solving equations by establishing a solid foundation for understanding how the equal sign functions in mathematics in general and in algebraic equations in particular. You will see us initiate our lesson by asking students to solve equations that are presented in parallel conjunction with a visual model of a balance scale.\n\nAs a teacher and an expert in the needs of your specific students, you will decide how much of a foundation already exists in your class and how much still needs to be developed. Thus you may leave the visual model sooner or later depending upon your students' conceptual development of equation solving.\n\nThis foundation is not only necessary for your students' understanding of equations, it will also provide invaluable assistance to their teachers in future higher mathematics courses who build upon the foundation we establish. Often students demonstrate some success in mathematics until they reach the secondary level. This can be attributed to the fact that some of them do not really understand mathematics at the elementary level but are simply mimicking our models and processes without conceptual fluency. As these mathematical processes become more involved in middle and high school, their lack of understanding leaves them with skills that are little more than trying to master algebra by rote procedures. While this worked on simpler or shorter problems in the past, it leaves them wandering without a compass in the rugged algebraic landscape.\n\nOne of the components of teaching mathematics using Conceptual Layering is the presentation of concepts using positive whole numbers. Only when students have demonstrated an understanding of the concept are fractions and negative integers introduced. During the course of this training video, we will focus on equations that utilize positive whole numbers to develop the concept. Many of the worksheets in the accompanying PDF handout provide students with opportunities to practice these same concepts with more challenging numbers.\" The vocabulary of additive inverses, multiplicative inverses, subtraction, division property of equality, and combining like terms are all covered in this video."}

The answer is 2n so I choose n/2 to see what happens. The software says \"Incorrect\" in red, does not offer the correct answer, and simply encourages me to go on to the next slide. Very helpful. I hit Next.\n\nEventually we get to play with two helicopters to solve x/2 - 3 = 1. I found myself wondering where the two expressions came from and what a helicopter would be doing hovering at x/2 - 3, but I was always a troublemaker in school. Nowhere does the software talk about needing to keep the two helicoptesr at the same altitude, let alone why we have to. Me, I like see-saws which are level when the two sides are the same, just as we want to preserve an equation's truth as we transform it. Anyway...\n\nClicking +3 on the first guy moves it up but leaves the expression as x/2 - 3. It should have changed to x/2, the way the other guy changed from 1 to 4 when I clicked +3. Clicking x2 (meaning multiply, not the variable x) finally changes the first guy to x. The other guy continues to work and becomes 8.\n\nNow the material simply goes wrong, saying we have to add before we multiply. No, that just makes it easier. And it gets worse: the text says that if we multiply by 2 first we will end up with the wrong answer, x=5. Nonsense, as the graphic shows: we end up with x - 3 = 5, what it calls \"an incomplete solution\". Thought one: well then it is not a solution! Add 3 to both sides!! And how on Earth did we get to x-3=5? By going x/2-3=1 to 2(x/2-3)=2*1 to x-6=2 to x-6+3=2+3. Right, they accepted as inevitable the two operations of adding at most 3 and multiplying by at most 3, with nothing else permitted. Hunh?\n\nJust this little bit of material is wrong in one place, inconsistent with itself, confusing, unmotivating, and plain leaves out the fundamental concept of preserving the truth of the equation as necessary.

{"text": "Pre-algebra\n\nposted on: 16 May, 2012 | updated on: 14 Sep, 2012\n\nIn study of Pre Algebra, we come across the following types of problems and then we follow certain rules and patters to solve the Set of Pre Algebra, problems. Prealgebra includes the study of solving the mathematical expressions and getting the solutions for the expressions with the real and integral values. While we study Pre Algebra, it includes the placement of variables and forming the expressions with the Combination of the variables, constants and the mathematical operators. It includes the study of the order of operation of expressions and getting solutions for it.\n\nHere we will learn the hierarchy of operations to be performed for solving the exponents, getting the solution of the Algebraic Equations. We will learn the methods of forming the algebraic expressions with the help of the statements and similarly we also learn to evaluate the values of the unknown variables and thus getting the solution.\nThe methods of forming the equations can be learned at the initial stage so that the child is able to learn the concept of algebra at the initial stage and thus he is ready to perform larger operations of algebra in higher grade mathematics. The study of Pre Algebra helps to translate the verbal phrases in the form of the mathematical and the algebraic expressions. We will learn to define and form the algebraic sentences and to translate Open Sentences into algebraic equations. The child is able to learn the rules followed for understanding the Order of Operations, which helps us to get the result out of the algebraic expressions. In other words we say that the pre algebra is the basic study of algebraic expressions and the algebraic operators in order to get the solution to the equations so formed, which are basically formed by the simple verbal statements.\n\nTopics Covered in Pre-algebra\n\nRoots and powers are related to each other. Square root of a number must be equals to power 2 of another number. Simple power can be defined as simple repetition of the number in the product form. This can be shown by the following example.\nIn expression 'PQ', term 'P' denotes a constant number and Q is power number P. If we take P = 3 and Q = 2 then expression w...Read More\n\nFactorization can be understood easily if you are familiar with word 'factor'.

This approach is often useful for solving combinatorial problems, especially problems where one has to identify some objects, and significantly reduces the number of students' errors. The book uses simple model problems to begin every section. Following their detailed analysis, the reader is led through the derivation of definitions, concepts, and methods for solving typical problems. Theorems are then formulated, proved, and illustrated by more problems of increasing difficulty. Topics covered include elementary combinatorial constructions, graphs and trees, hierarchical clustering algorithms, more advanced counting techniques, and existence theorems in combinatorial analysis. The textbook is suitable for undergraduate and entry-level graduate students as well as for self-education. Alexander Kheyfits (Assoc. Prof., Bronx Community) is on the doctoral faculty in physics."}

{"text": "The chapter begins with an exploratory problem designed to introduce the concept of linear programming with an objective function to maximize profits by optimizing a company's product mix. The problem context involves assembling two types of computers with different profit margins and labor requirements. Students are led through a graphical solution to a two decision variable problem involving two constraints.The second product mix example involves a detailed totally worked-out example involving the manufacture of skateboards. Students are shown step-by-step how to formulate and solve this two decision variable problem graphically. A third decision variable is then added to motivate the need for EXCEL to solve larger problems. Students are taught how to use SOLVER as standard add-in to EXCEL to solve linear programming problems. This section also discusses how to use the linear programming output to perform sensitivity analysis. There is also an optional section that discusses the Simplex algorithm that is the basis for computational solution of LP problems. The third example is a sports shoe company and focuses on interpretation of results. The text presents a fully formulated and solved problem involving six decision variables and six constraints. The emphasis is on interpreting the output from SOLVER and answering a variety of what-if questions.\n\nBinary programming is a form of integer programming. The word \"binary\" refers to the decision variables. When decision variables are binary, this means that they can only take on the values of either 0 or 1. That might seem overly restrictive, but there are many situations that can easily be modeled using binary decision variables. For example, the following decisions could be modeled with binary decision variables:\n- Should we located a new automobile dealership at this location?\n- Should I choose to apply to this college?\n- Should I invest in this stock?\n\nWe all make decisions everyday in our lives that involve uncertainty. Decision Trees is the first chapter in the Probabilistic material and introduces the concept of making decisions under uncertainty and risk. The decision tree methodology involves accounting for every possible decision and random event. The best alternative generally maximizes the expected value of profit or minimized the expected cost, however, other non-financial variables are also considered. Expected value does not also capture an individual's risk tolerance. This risk aversion is the foundation for the insurance industry. The final problem in this chapter follows Jee Min a high school junior as he tries to determine how much collision insurance he needs."}

(Hint: you understand something when you say \"Gosh, that makes sense! I should have thought of that myself!)\n\nHere's how it works. The teacher gets up and explains something, and you listen, and it makes sense, and you get it. You work a few problems in class. Then you go home, stare at a problem that looks exactly like the one the teacher put up on the board, and realize you have no idea how to do it. How did that happen? It looked so simple when the teacher did it! Hmm….\n\nSo, you dig through your notes, or the book, or you call your friend, or you just try something, and you try something else, and eventually…ta-da! You get the answer! Hooray! Now, you have learned the concept. You didn't learn it in class, you learned it when you figured out how to do it.\n\nOr, let's rewind time a bit. You dig through your notes, you just try something, and eventually…nothing. You still can't get it. That's OK! Come in the next day and say \"I couldn't get it.\" This time, when the teacher explains how to do it, you will have that \"Aha!\" experience: \"So that's why I couldn't get it to work!\"\n\nEither way, you win. But if you don't do the homework, then even if the teacher explains the exact same thing in class the next day, it won't help…any more than it helped the previous day.\n\nThe materials in this course-pack were originally developed for Mr. Felder's Advanced Algebra II classes in the 2001-2002 school year.

{"text": "+ By BYUNG SOO MOON\n\nThis book contains 64 mathematics problems with solutions in the fields of Geometry and Vectors. The problems were selected from the 330 problems taken for the Korea Sunung Suri(ga) mathematics during the period 2003 - 2013. The 330 problems have been classified into one of the five subjects; Mathematics (I), Mathematics (II), Calculus, Geometry with Vectors, and Probability and Statistics. Problems in each subject are published in a separate book. The 64 problems in this book are grouped into 3 chapters; 18 problems in conic sections (parabola, ellipsis, hyperbola), 26 for the space coordinates and three dimensional geometry, and 20 problems for vectors in the plane or the space. The major emphasis in writing solutions to the problems was placed on guiding the solution steps rather than explaining the details. Readers who need detail explanations can ask questions through email address provided in the very first page of this book. The e-mail response service is free for a period of one year from the date of the purchase."}

{"text": "What's the Best Math Software?!Thanks!\n\ndepends on what you are doing.\n\nFor Calculus mathematics, Mathematics is best.\nFor Algebraic Maths, Maple is best.\n\nyes, it depends entirely on what you're doing and what kind of data you're working with. All the different math programs do math very well, and for fairly generic stuff either of them will do the job. Some programs do certain things better than others though.\n\nIf you're doing a lot of symbolic stuff, then I would say go with Mathematica.\n\nIf you lots of data you need to crunch or you're doing a lot of numeric stuff, my choice would be Matlab (or one of it's many variants such as FreeMat or Octave).\n\nIf you're doing statistical analysis on a bunch of numbers, then I would go for something like S Plus or R.\n\nAnd the 'best math software' for one person isn't necessarily going to be the best one for you. And the best one for you now won't necessarily be the best one for you a few years down the road. Figure out what you need to do and what kind of data you're going to be working with first. Then ask about the best program for that task.\n\nWhat's the Best Math Software?!\n\nI absolutely agree that your selection of math software must be matched to your needs. I would recommend asking people in your field for advice because ultimately you will be collaborating with them and it becomes very difficult to to do so when you are using A and everyone else is using B.\n\nOn a slightly different note, I would discourage reliance on computer algebra systems until you have mastered the underlying mathematics on your own. Unless you have done so you will be unable to judge whether the results you obtain are correct or make sense. Use them as a guide!\n\nIn that regard, systems like Derive or MuPAD are great learning tools (and they are quite capable production tools too!) and cost much less than Mathematica. You will probably be disappointed in Calc Center which provides very little in terms of flexibility."}

This approach is often useful for solving combinatorial problems, especially problems where one has to identify some objects, and significantly reduces the number of students' errors. The book uses simple model problems to begin every section. Following their detailed analysis, the reader is led through the derivation of definitions, concepts, and methods for solving typical problems. Theorems are then formulated, proved, and illustrated by more problems of increasing difficulty. Topics covered include elementary combinatorial constructions, graphs and trees, hierarchical clustering algorithms, more advanced counting techniques, and existence theorems in combinatorial analysis. The textbook is suitable for undergraduate and entry-level graduate students as well as for self-education. Alexander Kheyfits (Assoc. Prof., Bronx Community) is on the doctoral faculty in physics."}

Every\nalgebraic manipulation carried out in a lecture is accompanied by a care-fully drawn picture in order to fix the idea that geometry and algebra go\nhand-in-glove to complete our understanding of complex numbers. We assign\nessentially every problem for homework.\n\nWe use the MATLAB programs in this chapter to illustrate the theory\nof complex numbers and to develop skill with the MATLAB language. The\nnumerical experiment introduces students to the basic quadratic\nequation of electrical and computer engineering and shows how the roots of\nthis quadratic equation depend on the coefficients of the equation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is hard to overestimate the value of complex numbers. They first\narose in the study of roots for quadratic equations. But, as with so many\nother great discoveries, complex numbers have found widespread application\nwell outside their original domain of discovery. They are now used throughout\nmathematics, applied science, and engineering to represent the harmonic nature of vibrating systems and oscillating fields. For example, complex numbers\nmay be used to study\n\ntraveling waves on a sea surface;\n\nstanding waves on a violin string;\n\nthe pure tone of a Kurzweil piano;\n\nthe acoustic field in a concert hall;\n\nthe light of a He-Ne laser;\n\nthe electromagnetic field in a light show;\n\nthe vibrations in a robot arm;\n\nthe oscillations of a suspension system;\n\nthe carrier signal used to transmit AM or FM radio;\n\nthe carrier signal used to transmit digital data over telephone lines; and\n\nthe 60 Hz signal used to deliver power to a home.\n\nIn this chapter we develop the algebra and geometry of complex numbers.\nIn Chapter 3 we will show how complex numbers are used to build phasor\nrepresentations of power and communication signals"}

Modeling such huge, complex systems, in which many of the stars have\nchaotic orbits, requires new computational techniques.Advances in the speed\nand memory of computers have improved models, as has parallel computing, but\nadvances in algorithms—the way the mathematics of a problem is converted\ninto steps a computer can perform—are indispensable in developing accurate\ngalaxy models.\n\nThe complexity of simulating the behavior of a galaxy is not limited to the galaxy\nitself. Since a galaxy is usually part of a cluster or supercluster of galaxies, the\nexternal forces exerted by these larger agglomerations on the galaxy must also be\naccounted for.Thus, models must be accurate across many scales of distance. Instead\nof numerically solving the equations of the model uniformly across all sectors,\nresearchers employ multi-scale algorithms that do more calculations in sectors\ndetermined to be more significant.This kind of technique uses computing power\nmore efficiently, giving us a glimpse of the underlying structure of the universe.\n\nNew: Edgewood College Undergraduate Math Journal\n\nFor submission guidelines and other information, please contact Steven Post.\n\nWHAT CAN I DO WITH A MATHEMATICS MAJOR?\n\nWhile the main motivation to choose math as a major should stem from a combination of keen interest and high ability in math, students are naturally concerned about the opportunities available to a mathematics major or a mathematics teaching major after graduation. At this time, the math major appears to be in a better position than many other majors for employment in business, industry, government agencies, and teaching. The prospects are also good for well-qualified students to obtain support for graduate studies in either mathematics or mathematics education. Also a major in mathematics is excellent preparation for further study in many other fields.\n\nIn order to help you clarify your thoughts on what you want to get out of your collegiate experience as a math major, here are some questions to ask yourself:\n\nWhy do I like mathematics? What is it about math that attracts me to majoring in mathematics?\n\nWhat type of mathematics do I like? Do I like the computational aspect? The rigor and logic? The problem solving experience? The theoretical aspect? Which content areas interest me?\n\nWhat do I want to do for a career? Do I want to teach, or do I want pursue other avenues? If you want to teach, then:\n\nwhat age group(s) do you want to teach? PreK, 1-6, 6-9, 9-12, college?\n\ndo you want to teach just mathematics, or do you want to have the flexibility to teach other fields as well?\n\nIf you are not interested in a career in teaching, then: are you interested in a career in business, industry, government, nonprofits, other alternatives?\n\nHow much education do I want to complete? Bachelors, Masters, or Ph.D.? Do I want to enter the work force right after graduation with the option to pursue graduate work later?\n\nWhat do I need to do in order to further my career prospects?\n\nWhat should I be doing academically to further my goals? Should I pick up a minor in another area? Should I try to double major?\n\nWhat extracurriculars should I become involved in to further my goals? For example, should I get involved with the math club? Should I participate in the MCM Modeling Competition?\n\nWhat types of work experience should I try to get to further my goals? Should I consider volunteer work experiences such as tutoring? Should I consider internships?\n\nWhat organizations should I become involved in?

We mostly made these throughout the whole module. You get data from a probability experiment and put them on these.\n\nNumber tricks: I didn't enjoy this part very much. During this section of the module, we learned ways to start with one number and always end with the same result using blocks or algebra.\n\nNumber sequences: This is basically solving patterns. For instance, 2, 4, 6, and so on, we would find out the next number, or term, 8. We would also need to find the rule, in this case, term number plus itself equals the term.\n\nExponents: In module 1, we learned a little bit about exponents. Not too big ones, but things like two to the fourth power, or sixteen. We learned how to write it in standard form, or a normal number, as well as the exponential form.\n\nProbability: Goodness, this was a big part of Module 1! This was basically learning the probability of certain events and putting it into fractions and frequency tables, like picking a certain color marble out of a bunch.

{"text": "Appendix B. Linear algebra - Pg. 335\n\nappendix B: Linear algebra To understand advanced machine learning topics, you need to know some linear algebra. If you want to take an algorithm from an academic paper and implement it in code or investigate algorithms outside of this book, you'll probably need a basic understanding of linear algebra. This appendix should serve as a light refresher or introduction if you've had this material before but it's been a while and you need a reminder. If you've never had this material before, I recommend that you take a course at a university, work through a self-study book, or watch a video. Free tuto- rial videos are available on the internet 1 as well as full recordings of semester-long courses. 2 Have you ever heard \"Math is not a spectator sport\"? It's true. Working through examples on your own is necessary to reinforce what you've watched oth- ers do in a book or video. We'll first discuss the basic building block of linear algebra, the matrix.

{"text": "MTH60 Introductory Algebra- 1st Term\n\nIntroduction to algebraic concepts and processes with a focus on linear equations and inequalities in one and two variables. Applications, graphs, functions, formulas, and proper mathematical notation are emphasized throughout the course. A scientific calculator is required. The TI-30X II is recommended. Prerequisites: MTH 20 and RD 80 (or ESOL 250). Audit available.\n(For detailed information, see the Course Content and Outcome Guide ).\n\nMTH 60 is a first term beginning algebra course that focuses on the symbolic algebra skills needed for further course work in mathematics and science.\n\nIn this telecourse, you will watch lessons on Comcast Cable channel 27 (Portland area only), on your computer via youtube, or on VHS tapes that can be viewed at the library. Each week you will be expected to watch two lessons. Hopefully, you'll find the lessons thorough and comprehensive. Nonetheless, it will be important that you also read the corresponding sections of your textbook and do the suggested practice problems. You will also need to log in to Desire2Learn several times a week as I send announcements via Desire2Learn. The youtube links will also be available in Desire2Learn.\n\nYou need to purchase the text at the Sylvania bookstore.\n\nTHOUGHTS ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING AND MATHEMATICS:\n\nIt is not easy to learn mathematics via pre-recorded lessons. The time you would spend in class will instead be spent watching the lessons, reading and studying mathematics in your textbook. To be successful in this class, you must be an independent learner.\n\nThis course, like other math courses, is time-intensive. Classes like this one typically require about five hours each week watching, pausing and reviewing the lessons (just like attending class) and an additional eight to twelve hours reading the textbook, doing homework, and studying.\n\nPlease assess your situation, and determine if you will be able to commit this kind of time to the class. Also think about the type of learner you are. Teleweb courses are a terrific option, especially for independent, self-motivated learners. If this does not describe you, consider why it is you are thinking about taking this type of class, and if it really is a medium that will give you the best chance to succeed. DO NOT TAKE MTH 60 via TELEWEB BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WILL BE EASIER THAN AN ON-CAMPUS CLASS. For many students, it is HARDER via teleweb than on-campus. This is not a self-paced course. There are specific due dates and I do not accept late work.\n\nCourse Specific Requirements:\n\nIMPORTANT DETAILS:\n\nThere are three proctored paper-and-pencil, no-notes, no-books, no calculator exams (two midterms and a final). There will be scheduled times to take those exams at the Sylvania Campus, but if you live out of town, you can make arrangements with me to take the exam at an approved college testing center. If you live in the Portland area, you must take the exam at the Sylvania Campus. I do not offer testing at the other PCC campuses. Otherwise, the entire course can be completed from home. The five graded worksheets can be mailed.\n\nStudents with disabilities should notify their instructor if accommodations are needed to take this class. For information about technologies that help people with disabilities in taking Web based distance learning classes please visit the Office for Students with Disabilities website."}

{"text": "Question 3 on Paper 1 covers these two topics, which are apparently unconnected. Not that it concerns us, but the topics become interwoven at university level maths. Anyway this question is one of the more popular on the first paper, and has often been the easiest question on the paper. There have been exceptions; in 1998, Question 3(c) was particularly difficult.\n\nComplex numbers deal with the so-called 'imaginary unit', i, which stands for the square root of -1. It might at first appear as if this quantity has nothing to do with the world we live in, not existing in the way the number 3 'exists'. However, complex numbers have many applications in engineering, physics and science in general. On our course we discuss the properties of complex numbers, see how they help us to solve equations and investigate how to use complex numbers written in polar form.\n\nMatrices were originally introduced to simplify the maths involved in transformation geometry, although in Question 3 on Paper 1 we do not see them being used for this purpose. We concentrate on the definitions associated with matrices and how we can perform the basic operations of addition, multiplication, etc. One interesting feature of matrices is the absence of division, and the use of the inverse of a matrix to overcome this problem.\n\nTopic Structure: Complex Numbers\n\nThe study of Senior Cycle Complex Numbers can be divided into the following sections:\n\n1.

{"text": "rigorous yet elementary introduction to the theory of analytic functions of a single complex variable. While presupposing in its readership a degree of mathematical maturity, it insists on no formal prerequisites beyond a sound knowledge of calculus. Starting from basic definitions, the text slowly and carefully develops the ideas of complex analysis to the point where such landmarks of the subject as Cauchy's theorem, the Riemann mapping theorem, and the theorem of Mittag-Leffler can be treated without sidestepping any issues of rigor. The emphasis throughout is a geometric one, most pronounced in the extensive chapter dealing with conformal mapping, which amounts essentially to a \"short course\" in that important area of complex function theory. Each chapter concludes with a wide selection of exercises, ranging from straightforward computations to problems of a more conceptual and thought-provoking nature."}

{"text": "from 100 providers and counting...\n\nIn the first six weeks of the course, we begin with an introduction to the parts of the upper limb and a discussion of the anatomic position, including the three-dimensional planes in which body movements are performed. Next, we cover the osteology of the upper limb by describing the bones of the extremity, how they articulate at synovial joints, and the movements that are possible at these joints. We explore the blood supply and innervation to the upper limb.\n\nA revolution is underway in science classrooms. The demands of the new workplace and the ready access to information afforded by new technologies have radically changed the way we define a scientifically literate society.\n\nMore than ever teachers need professional development that provides them with the resources they need and empowers them to take the action required to build classrooms where the next generation of scientifically literate students will flourish.\n\nComplex analysis is the study of functions that live in the complex plane, i.e. functions that have complex arguments and complex outputs. In order to study the behavior of such functions we'll need to first understand the basic objects involved, namely the complex numbers. We'll begin with some history: When and why were complex numbers invented? Was it the need for a solution of the equation x^2 = -1 that brought the field of complex analysis into being, or were there other reasons?"}
{"text": "We will begin with a brief review of (systems of) linear equations. Then, we will learn how to solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan elimination. We sill discuss matrix algebra with applications to input-output analysis and Markov processes Input-output analysis is used to determine how interdependent producers should behave. Markov processes are used to predict long term values of interdependent quantities that vary probabilistically.\nNext, we will talk about linear programming (LP) problems. An LP problem is on in which you seek to maximize a linear function—profit, for example—subject to certain linear constraints, such as budgetary or workforce limitations. You will learn to solve LP problems geometrically, using the simplex method, and by computer.\nInteger and 0-1 programming problems, which are closely related to LP problems, are too labor-intensive to solve by hand. We will learn how to solve them using Excel. We will touch briefly on the subject of computational complexity.\nWe will take a look at game theory, the study of strategic interactions between competing interests. We will explore the connection between game theory and LP problems.\nFinally, we will look at the mathematics of finance. Here we study how different forms of interest can affect loans and investments.\n\nDescription:\n\nThis syllabus was submitted to the Rhodes College Office of Academic Affairs by the course instructor."}
{"text": "College Algebra\n\nSheldon Axler brings a brand new approach to the study of advanced algebra. While many students will bypass the book and go straight for the solutions manual, this text integrates the two in order to engage students in the text itself. The integration of solution manual into the text allows the text to focus more centrally on explanations of the material and examples of the concepts. With explanations and examples all written by the author, there is a seamless integration between the two.\n\nIn order to facilitate conceptual understanding, some exercises and problems intentionally reinforce material from earlier in the book and require multiple steps. Although such multi-step exercises require more thought than most exercises, they allow students to see crucial concepts more than once, sometimes in unexpected contexts.\n\nDepth, Not Breadth: Topics have been carefully selected to get at the heart of algebraic weakness by narrowing down to key sets of skills which are regularly revisited from varied perspectives.\n\nExercises and Problems: The difference between an exercise and a problem is that each exercise has a unique correct answer that is a mathematical object such as a number or a function, while the solutions to problems consist of explanations or examples. The solutions to the odd-numbered exercises appear directly behind the relevant section.\n\nVariety: Exercises and problems in this book vary greatly in difficulty and purpose. Some exercises and problems are designed to hone algebraic manipulation skills; other exercises and problems are designed to push students to genuine understanding. Applications are written to reflect real scenarios, not artificial examples.\n\nIntegrated Student's Solutions Manual: The solutions manual encourages students to read the main text and students will save money by not having to purchase a separate solutions manual.\n\nDesigned To Be Read: The writing style and layout are meant to induce students to read and understand the material. Explanations are more plentiful than typically found in College Algebra books, with examples of concepts making the ideas concrete whenever possible.\n\nCalculator Problems: A symbol appears next to problems that require a calculator; some exercises and problems are designed to make students realize that by understanding the material, they can overcome the limitations of calculators."}

{"text": "Shipping prices may be approximate. Please verify cost before checkout.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nAlgebraic Geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations in one or more variables, asking such questions as: Does the system have finitely many solutions, and if so how can one find them? And if there are infinitely many solutions, how can they be described and manipulated? The solutions of a system of polynomial equations form a geometric object called a variety; the corresponding algebraic object is an ideal. There is a close relationship between ideals and varieties which reveals the intimate link between algebra and geometry. Written at a level appropriate to undergraduates, this book covers such topics as the Hilbert Basis Theorem, the Nullstellensatz, invariant theory, projective geometry, and dimension theory. The algorithms to answer questions such as those posed above are an important part of algebraic geometry. This book bases its discussion of algorithms on a generalization of the division algorithm for polynomials in one variable that was only discovered in the 1960's. Although the algorithmic roots of algebraic geometry are old, the computational aspects were neglected earlier in this century. This has changed in recent years, and new algorithms, coupled with the power of fast computers, have let to some interesting applications, for example in robotics and in geometric theorem proving. In preparing a new edition of Ideals, Varieties andAlgorithms the authors present an improved proof of the Buchberger Criterion as well as a proof of Bezout's Theorem.

They have\nthe unique property of representing and manipulating two variables as a single quantity. This\nfits very naturally with Fourier analysis, where the frequency domain is composed of two\nsignals, the real and the imaginary parts. Complex numbers shorten the equations used in DSP,\nand enable techniques that are difficult or impossible with real numbers alone. For instance,\nthe Fast Fourier Transform is based on complex numbers. Unfortunately, complex techniques\nare very mathematical, and it requires a great deal of study and practice to use them effectively.\nMany scientists and engineers regard complex techniques as the dividing line between DSP as\na tool, and DSP as a career. In this chapter, we look at the mathematics of complex numbers,\nand elementary ways of using them in science and engineering. The following three chapters\ndiscuss important techniques based on complex numbers: the complex Fourier transform, the Laplace\ntransform, and the z-transform.

{"text": "Algebra II—Semester A\n\nYou had so much fun in Algebra that you had to come back for more? Yeah, we don't blame you.\n\nAlgebra II has all the expressions and equations you've seen before…and then some. You're sure to see some old familiar friends along the way (we're looking at you, polynomials), along with a few unfamiliar faces (we're looking—or at least trying to look at you, imaginary numbers).\n\nSemester A starts off with expressions, polynomials, and a beautiful thing we've all seen before: factoring. After being able to rearrange polynomials in more ways than a contortionist, we'll venture into the land of the imaginary. (Feel free to extend an invite to your imaginary childhood friend, Maurice.) We'll finish up the semester by working with more equations and inequalities than you can shake a dotted line at.\n\nCourse Breakdown\n\nUnit 1. Seeing Structure in Expressions\n\nWe'll start the course off by diving headfirst into expressions! With the help of factoring, radicals, and even sequences and series, we'll be able to pluck out different parts of an expression and figure out if two expressions are two peas in a pod or two peas in…separate pods. Because sometimes, one pod is just too cramped.\n\n$15.59add to cartremove\n\nUnit 2. Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions\n\nYou may have dealt with polynomials and rational expressions in the past, but you ain't never seen 'em like this before. Not only will we gain some new tips and tricks to help us deal with these pesky expressions, we'll learn and even prove a few theorems along the way. Yeah, we mean business.\n\n$15.59add to cartremove\n\nUnit 3. The Complex Number System\n\nYou might think imaginary numbers are about as helpful as Maurice, your imaginary friend from kindergarten. We'll fill you in on a little secret: while Maurice can't deal with negatives under the radical or tell you about the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, imaginary numbers can—and will. Then again, Maurice can make a mean imaginary apple cobbler. We all have our strengths.\n\n$15.59add to cartremove\n\nUnit 4. Creating Equations\n\nThis unit is all about using the magic of the equal sign to create and solve problems. (We'd use the magic of Houdini, but we're still working on that rope escape trick.) By creating and graphing every type of equation you can possibly think of, we'll learn how to tell them apart and understand which type of equation is applicable to which situation.\n\n$15.59add to cartremove\n\nUnit 5. Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities\n\nFor this unit, we're going how to put all the equations we created to use. We're going to graph our creations—both separately and together—and see how to use them to solve problems. More often than not, they can do a significant portion of the work for us, and who doesn't love outsourcing their work? So put your feet up, grab a piña colada, and let equations and inequalities do the work for you. (Not really.)"}

{"text": "Traditional undergraduate physics courses typically employ the well-known lecture-and-recitation structure. These courses tend to be theory oriented with occasional demonstrations and a few references to crucial experiments. If such a course incorporates the computer, it is often an embellishment and does not replace existing material. A common approach to incorporating computers into a beginning course is for the instructor to present or make available some sort of simulation where the user can adjust parameters that control aspects of the simulation. Through this process, it is hoped that students will gain qualitative insight into the phenomena under consideration. However, which equations are being solved and by what method usually receive scant attention. Some beginning texts include a few spreadsheet problems or numerical examples that require a computer; typically these problems are in a separate section."}

{"text": "In this algebra functions worksheet, students review the definition of a function and the four different ways to represent a function. Students then determine if the four given examples represent functions. Students explain their answers.\n\nFull of info, this handout provides the rules, properties, and common mistakes found in an algebra course. This cheat sheet is a great resource for those hard-to-remember exponent rules and hyperbola equations, along with everything else your mathematicians need to remember. The first two pages are full of algebra topics, while the last page lists common errors and explanations.\n\nYour young algebra engineers brainstorm a list of machines that are then related to algebra functions to begin their exploration of the mighty invention called function notation. A discussion follows using a box to represent the machine (which is named F) that takes in the raw material and alters it. The young engineers are then catapulted into an activity to soar higher in their understanding of a function. When they land, they are able to model a situation using function notation, evaluate function values given domain inputs, interpret the meaning of a function value in context, and leap tall buildings in a single bound.\n\nIn this introduction to functions video, Sal gives an intuitive definition of what a function is and introduces the function notion, f(x). He finishes the video by looking at a simple example of evaluating g(f(x)) without getting into much of the complexity of composite functions.\n\nStudents graph polynomials functions and analyze the end behavior. In this algebra lesson, student differentiate between the different polynomials based on the exponents. They use a TI to help with the graphing.\n\nIn this algebra activity, 6th graders review different ways to represent a function. They tell whether a function is represented in the first 2 questions, use rules to complete 6 function tables, and complete 1 word problem.\n\nIn this algebraic functions worksheet, learners write a function to determine the relationship between people and barrels of oil used. They research the population of the 10 largest cities in their state and use this functional relationship to calculate the number of barrels and gallons of oil used by each city.\n\nStarting from a brief look at functions and the mapping of domains to ranges, Sal starts out with an intuitive sense of what a function inverse is. He then, using an example, shows how to find the inverse of a function and also shows how the graph of the function and its inverse are reflections over the y = x line. This video provides a good review of function inverses for more advanced students or a nice introduction for the beginning student.\n\nAre odd numbers connected to odd functions and even numbers to even functions? This video tries to clarify that connection. It also talks about functions that are neither odd nor even to give a more intuitive feeling about classifying these functionsWe look at a number of different examples of functions and see what their domain is. Sal writes the domain in set notion and shows how different functions can have different input values that cause the function to be undefined.\n\nStudents use a table, graph or equation to represent a quadratic function. In this algebra lesson, students model and graph with quadratic function. They become comfortable representing quadratics using different methods.\n\nAfter defining a simple function from a word problem, this video, shows how one could find the domain and the range of that function. The goals here are to reinforce the definitions of domain and range with a concrete example."}

{"text": "numerical recipes\n\nNumerical Recipes, particularly the code in it, has something of a mixed reputation. Numerical methods are very hard for a layman such as myself to assess: Are they fast? Are they stable?\n\nMany specialists think they're not. One example is the page Why not use Numerical Recipes? on (sorry, I know you don't like URLs on E2) I've also heard doubts expressed by a numerical analyst. Frankly, not being an expert on the subject, I'm not sure.\n\nThey do do a good job of explaining the bare facts of each type of problem. Certainly (in my experience) enough to give you the vocabulary you need to seek out more specific help. But you'll probably want to consult a numerical analyst regarding the specifics of your problem before using their codes; other codes are often also available, e.g. at Netlib.\n\nAs well as a host of other common problems, and the occasional geek-oriented commentary on the world. I quote from the introduction to the chapter on statistical description of data (italics are theirs) chosen to show the entertaining and whimsical nature of some of the accompanying text:\n\n\"If a statistic falls in a reasonable part of the distribution, you must not make the mistake of concluding that the null hypothesis is 'verified' or 'proved.' That is the curse of statistics, that it can never prove things, only disprove them! At best, you can substantiate a hypothesis by ruling out, statistically, a whole long list of competing hypotheses, every one that has ever been proposed. After a while your adversaries and competitors will give up trying to think of alternative hypotheses, or else they will grow old and die, and then your hypothesis will become accepted. Sounds crazy, we know, but that's how science works!\"\n\nThe books take the form of describing an algorithm and then showing a sample implementation. The descriptions are brief and a little dense, but very helpful because they are a good starting point to go look for more information. The example code, however (at least in the C version of the book) is next to useless for a variety of reasons (including the fact that because the code is essentially just translated from FORTRAN all the arrays are treated as 1 based). That being said, the practical and concise description of the methods still make the book more than worth it."}

{"text": "This is a comprehensive textbook in linear programming, slanted toward the difficulties that arise in optimizing large real-life systems. The present volume is a slightly-corrected reprint of the 1985 McGraw-Hill fifth edition.\n\nThe book is aimed at a broad mathematics, engineering, and economics audience at the upper undergraduate level. It includes a chapter of fairly detailed background material on the linear mathematics needed. Much of the book deals with algorithmic issues such as finding a first feasible solution, stability, sensitivity, anti-cycling, sparse matrices, and implementation issues for computer programs. It does not cover specific numerical analysis issues such as rounding error. The book covers primarily the simplex method and continuous linear problems, but also has some material on integer programming and on nonlinear programming. It was last updated in 1985 and so does not cover discoveries made since then, such as Khachiyan's algorithm and Karmarkar's algorithm.\n\nBottom line: a thorough, broadly-applicable, and not-too-dated text at a bargain Dover price."}

It has a nice simple syntax, and it compiles with a JIT, so it's fast. Also it interfaces easily with python, so you can get all the benefits of pythons massive set of libraries.\n\nI really enjoy Reid's book, but for a first introduction I would look into Cox, Little and O'Shea's book Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms.

If Artin is ok with skipping around in a math book, then I'm pretty sure it's ok.\n\nFirst, teach something applied that interests you. It could be just about anything, but having a teacher that is enthusiastic about a subject helps students immensely. Second, make sure that you show them how to implement solutions on a computer. This is for students that want to do applied maths, so knowing how to do it on a computer is required. Since it isn't a computer course I wouldn't require them to do much programming, but showing them python code, or Maxima or Octave code opens a door.

Unlike other introductory algebra texts, Yoshiwara's INTRODUCTORY ALGEBRA, builds an intuitive framework for the future study of functions in intermediate algebra. This clearly differentiates Yoshiwara from standard introductory algebra texts. The text emphasizes the study of tables and graphs, and the concept of the variable is developed from that platform. Graphs are used extensively throughout the book to illustrate algebraic technique and to help students visualize relationships between variables. The numerous labeled grids paired with exercises throughout the text reinforce the need to draw graphs by hand while helping students to focus on the properties of the graphs by eliminating the time-consuming task for beginning students of choosing the appropriate scales for the axes.

Rather than follow the traditional approach of stating mathematical principles and then citing some physical examples for illustration, the book puts applications at centre stage; that is, it starts with the problem, finds the mathematics that suits it and ends with a mathematical analysis of the physics. Physical examples are selected primarily from applied mechanics. Among topics included are Fourier series, separation of variables, Bessel functions, Fourier and Laplace transforms, Green's functions and complex function theories. Also covered are advanced topics such as Riemann-Hilbert techniques, perturbation methods, and practical topics such as symbolic computation.

{"text": "Quick Calculations\n\nIf you are looking for a tool to perform quick, on-the-fly calculations, Maple is the ideal choice. Maple is an easy-to-use tool that is designed to do real mathematics. It provides exact, symbolic answers to your mathematical problems, not just numerical approximations: if the answer is , that is exactly what Maple gives you. Answers can frequently be found with a click of a button, calculations can be modified and re-executed, solution methods are recorded, solutions are easily visualized, and problem-solving sessions can easily be turned into full reports, all within the same environment.\n\nClick for larger version\n\nEasy Problem Entry, Rapid Solutions\n\nMathematical problems are composed in Maple using natural mathematical notation. Users have the flexibility of entering problems through palettes, the keyboard, or a combination of both. Mathematical expressions are created using standard mathematical notation, including standard abbreviations. For example, 10x means \"10 times x\", and y' means y'(x).\n\nMany solutions can be found literally with a click of a button. Smart context-sensitive menus provide an appropriate choice of mathematical operations; simply select what you want, and the answer appears.\n\nInteractive assistants, tutors, and task templates are also available to guide you through multi-step problems, explore concepts, and modify options. If you prefer to use commands directly, you also have access to Maple's extensive command set and full programming language.\n\nMaple Does More\n\nMaple does more than simply answer the question you asked. With Maple:\n\nYou get a record of all the steps you took in your computation. Context-menu operations are automatically documented by Maple. Methods, and not just final answers, can be reviewed, giving you confidence in your results.\n\nProblems can be modified and multi-step calculations redone with a click of a button. All intermediate calculations, including plots, are visibly updated.\n\nYou have easy access to over 150 plot types and options and the ability to programmatically create more. Many plots and animations can be created and modified through the point-and-click Plot Builder assistant. Plots can be manipulated interactively, including panning, zooming, and real-time rotation of 3-D plots.\n\nA wide variety of built-in tools and resources are available, such as a database of scientific constants, units support, a function advisor, a back-solver, and an Exploration Assistant that lets you visually explore any mathematical or Maple expression.\n\nClick for larger version\n\nPreserving and Documenting your Results\n\nWhen you started, you may have thought you just needed a quick answer to a quick question. By the time you were finished, you realized you had done considerably more, and you don't want to lose the thought processes that went into your solution. Fortunately, in addition to being a calculation tool, Maple is a full technical documentation environment. You can easily go back and add explanations (in text and mathematical notion), explanatory diagrams, annotations to your plot to highlight key areas, and more. And of course, your mathematical calculations are still live–you can still make changes to the mathematics, add additional calculations, change parameters, and update results, even after you've created your document.\n\nOnce you are done, you can print your document, share it with others instantly through the MapleCloud Document Exchange, email it to a colleague, export it to HTML or PDF, present it as a slide-show, or further develop it into a full-blown interactive application for others to use."}

This restricts the readership of such books especially by programmers working in computer graphics, who simply want guidance on algorithm design.\nGeometric algebra provides a unified algebraic system for solving a wide variety of geometric problems. John Vince reveals the beauty of this algebraic framework and communicates to the reader new and unusual mathematical concepts using colour illustrations, tabulations, and easy-to-follow algebraic proofs.\nThe book includes many worked examples to show how the algebra works in practice and is essential reading for anyone involved in designing 3D geometric algorithms."}

Thank you!\n\nI maybe able to help if you can be more specific and give more details about answers to middle school math with pizzazz book e . A right computer program would be best option rather than a math tutor. After trying a number of program I found the Algebrator to be the best I have so far found. It solves any algebra problem from your book. It also explains all the steps (of the solution). You can just write it down as your homework assignment. However, you should use it to learn algebra, and simply not use it to copy answers.\n\nI checked out each one of them myself and that was when I came across Algebrator . I found it particularly appropriate for logarithms, logarithms and lcf. It was actually also kid's play to run this. Once you key in the problem, the program carries you all the way to the answer explaining each step on its way. That's what makes it great. By the time you arrive at the answer, you by now know how to explain the problems.

{"text": "Amazon.com description:Product Description: This book introduces the mathematics that supports advanced computer programming and the analysis of algorithms. The primary aim of its well-known authors is to provide a solid and relevant base of mathematical skills - the skills needed to solve complex problems, to evaluate horrendous sums, and to discover subtle patterns in data. It is an indispensable text and reference not only for computer scientists - the authors themselves rely heavily on it! - but for serious users of mathematics in virtually every discipline. Concrete Mathematics is a blending of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics. \"More concretely,\" the authors explain, \"it is the controlled manipulation of mathematical formulas, using a collection of techniques for solving problems.\" The subject matter is primarily an expansion of the Mathematical Preliminaries section in Knuth's classic Art of Computer Programming, but the style of presentation is more leisurely, and individual topics are covered more deeply. Several new topics have been added, and the most significant ideas have been traced to their historical roots. The book includes more than 500 exercises, divided into six categories.Complete answers are provided for all exercises, except research problems, making the book particularly valuable for self-study. Major topics include: *Sums *Recurrences *Integer functions *Elementary number theory *Binomial coefficients *Generating functions *Discrete probability *Asymptotic methods This second edition includes important new material about mechanical summation. In response to the widespread use of the first edition as a reference book, the bibliography and index have also been expanded, and additional nontrivial improvements can be found on almost every page. Readers will appreciate the informal style of Concrete Mathematics. Particularly enjoyable are the marginal graffiti contributed by students who have taken courses based on this material. The authors want to convey not only the importance of the techniques presented, but some of the fun in learning and using them. 0201558025B04062001"}

{"text": "Course Description\n\nThe objective of this course is to provide students an in-depth understanding of mathematical functions and inequalities by producing artistic pictures and animations using the Desmos calculator ( By graphing functions and inequalities using the Desmos calculator, students can create beautiful and interesting artistic images by drawing curves and shading various regions in different colors. Some of these creations can then be made more dynamic by animating the objects in them. Thus they will understand these rather complex equations in a playful and creative manner and in the process reinforce the concepts learned in Algebra 1 and 2.\n\nThe outline of the course is as follows:\nDay 1: The students will start with various different functions (algebraic, piecewise, and sine and cosine functions), and then analyze the equations of a circle, parabola and ellipse as well as polar equations. Students will use animations to graph more complex functions.\nDay 2: Students will shade regions defined by systems of inequalities using the Desmos calculator. They will then discuss parametric equations and understand how these can result in the creation of further more beautiful animations.\nDay 3: Students will work in groups to create an animated picture of a cup filled with steaming coffee. They will also create art work containing flowers and some other pictures provided to them.\nDays 4 & 5: Students, divided into groups of two, will select a straight forward work of art and as their final project recreate the piece of art work. Each group will analyze which mathematical functions and inequalities with which domain restrictions will be needed to replicate the art work.\n\nAfter the completion of this course students will be able to: (1) identify the equation of a graph, (2) sketch the graph of various functions, (3) learn about equations of conics and how their graphs are traced by animations , (4) use translations and dilations to obtain graphs of functions from standard forms, (5) understand the connection between shaded regions and inequalities, (6) use the Desmos calculator proficiently to create graphs and animations, and (7) appreciate an innovative application of mathematics. Intimate familiarity with graphs of functions is a very important element in the content of college algebra, pre-calculus, and calculus sequence courses.\n\nThe prerequisites include some familiarity with Algebra 2 and high school Geometry."}

It is a common misconception that an online math class will be easier. The time that would have been spent in class is instead spent watching the pre-recorded lessons, reading your textbook, and practicing the problems from your textbook.\n\nThis course will require a significant amount of time. You should plan to spend 5 hours a week watching, pausing, and reviewing the lessons. In addition, you should plan on spending 8 to 12 hours a week reading the textbook, practicing problems, and completing your assignments.\n\nThis class is NOT self-paced. There are specific due dates each week and I do not accept late work. Additionally, you cannot expect to do all the work each week in one sitting or even in one day.

These will be paper-and-pencil exams and you will NOT be allowed to use any notes or your book. Additionally, you will not be allowed to use a calculator on the first exam and part of the final exam. You will be able to use a calculator on your second test. There will be scheduled times to take these exams at the Sylvania Campus. If you live in the Portland Metro Area, you must take these exams at the Sylvania Campus. If you live outside the Portland Metro Area, you must take these exams at an approved college testing center near you. (This will need to be arranged during the first week of the term.)\n\nBesides the three proctored exams, the rest of the course can be completed from home.

Separate the twenty things from a hundred and a square, and add them to eighty-one. It will then be a hundred plus a square, which is equal to a hundred and one roots.

{"text": "97804719709hematics in Engineering and Science\n\nIn today's world, technology plays an increasingly important role. At the same time, mathematics is finding ever wider areas of application as we seek to understand more about the way in which nature works. Traditionally, engineering and science have relied on mathematical models for design and for the prediction of the behaviour of phenomena. Although widespread availability of computers and pocket calculators has reduced the need for long, tedious calculations to be carried out manually, it is still important to be able to perform simple calculations in order to have a feel for the processes involved. This book starts with a detailed synopsis of the material included in the authors' related textbook Foundation Mathematics (Wiley, 1998). It then expands the material in the areas of trigonometry, solution of equations and algebra. Vectors are covered next, then calculus is taken forward into geometrical applications. Matrix algebra and uncertainty follow before deeper analysis in chapters on integer variables, differential equations and complex numbers leads towards an appendix on mathematical modelling. Each chapter opens with a list of learning objectives and ends with a summary of key points and results. A generous supply of worked examples incorporating motivational applications is designed to build knowledge and skill. Drill and practice is essential and the exercises are graded in difficulty for reading and revision: the answers at the end of each chapter include helpful hints. Use of a pocket calculator is encouraged where appropriate. Many of the exercises can be validated by computer algebra and its use is strongly recommended where higher algebraic accuracy can be achieved and drudgery removed. The concise and focused approach of Mathematics in Engineering and Science will enable the student reader to approach the challenges of mathematics in a course at university level with confidence.\n\nFoundation Mathematics and Mathematics in Engineering and Science are written to be both complementary and independent; students may follow both books consecutively or may use just one, depending on their previous mathematical experience and the level of mathematical development that they wish to achieve"}

The framework comes from an insight that, once articulated, will drive the subsequent mathematics and lead to new results.In the second part, the text proceeds to a leisurely exploration of interesting ramifications of the main concepts. The book covers most, if not all, of the material contained in Bers' courses on first year complex analysis. In addition, topics of current interest such as zeros of holomorphic functions and the connection between hyperbolic geometry and complex analysis are explored. The organization of material in this book allows for an elegant and economical treatment of many important topics. (source: Nielsen Book Data)"}

{"text": "97804866468 Complex Analysis (Dover Books on Mathematics)\n\nIntroductory Complex Analysis is a scaled-down version of A. I. Markushevich's masterly three-volume \"Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable.\" Dr. Richard Silverman, the editor and translator of the original, has prepared this shorter version expressly to meet the needs of a one-year graduate or undergraduate course in complex analysis. In his selection and adaptation of the more elementary topics from the original larger work, he was guided by a brief course prepared by Markushevich himself. The book begins with fundamentals, with a definition of complex numbers, their geometric representation, their algebra, powers and roots of complex numbers, set theory as applied to complex analysis, and complex functions and sequences. The notions of proper and improper complex numbers and of infinity are fully and clearly explained, as is stereographic projection. Individual chapters then cover limits and continuity, differentiation of analytic functions, polynomials and rational functions, Mobius transformations with their circle-preserving property, exponentials and logarithms, complex integrals and the Cauchy theorem , complex series and uniform convergence, power series, Laurent series and singular points, the residue theorem and its implications, harmonic functions (a subject too often slighted in first courses in complex analysis), partial fraction expansions, conformal mapping, and analytic continuation. Elementary functions are given a more detailed treatment than is usual for a book at this level. Also, there is an extended discussion of the Schwarz-Christolfel transformation, which is particularly important for applications. There is a great abundance of worked-out examples, and over three hundred problems (some with hints and answers), making this an excellent textbook for classroom use as well as for independent study. A noteworthy feature is the fact that the parentage of this volume makes it possible for the student to pursue various advanced topics in more detail in the three-volume original, without the problem of having to adjust to a new terminology and notation . In this way, IntroductoryComplex Analysis serves as an introduction not only to the whole field of complex analysis, but also to the magnum opus of an important contemporary Russian mathematician"}

{"text": "Administrivia\n\nCourse Description\n\nMost combinatorial optimization problems of interest turn out to be NP-hard to optimize exactly. In this light, the focus shifts to the design of approximation algorithms, i.e., algorithms that yield provable guarantees regarding the optimum. It is then natural to wonder, given a NP-hard optimization problem, what is the best approximation that can be efficiently computed? Answering this questioninvolves the design of approximation algorithms and proving matching hardness results precluding any better approximation.\n\nOver the last two decades, great strides have been made both in algorithmic techniques and hardness results, thereby resolving the approximability of problems such as set cover. While the approximability of several important problems like sparsest cut and vertex cover are not well understood, exciting developments in recent years have shown that their complexity hinges on what is referred to as the Unique Games Conjecture. The study of approximability has not only revealed surprising connections between algorithmic techniques such as linear/semidefinite programming and hardness results, but has also drawn on tools from property testing, geometric embeddings and harmonic analysis.\n\nOnline Resources\n\nThe PCP Theorem and Hardness of Approximation An excellent set of lecture notes on hardness of approximation from the course by Venkatesan Guruswami and Ryan O'Donnell.

This book takes the same approach as the regular Blitzer College Algebra 3e version, but has been condensed by deleting the last 3 chapters (Chapter 6 Matrices and Determinants, Chapter 7 Conic Sections and Analytic Geometry, and Chapter 8 Sequences, Induction, and Probability). This text explores math the way it evolved: by describing real problems and how math explains them. It is interesting, lively (with applications you won't see in any other math book), and exceedingly clear. Blitzer's philosophy: present the full scope of mathematics, while always (1) engaging the student by opening their minds to learning (2) keeping the student engaged on every page (3) explaining ideas directly, simply, and clearly. Students are strongly supported by a consistent pedagogical framework. A See it, Hear it, Try it? format consistently walks students through each and every example in just the same way that an instructor would teach this example in class. Blitzer liberally inserts voice balloons and annotations throughout the text helping clarify the more difficult concepts for students."}

{"text": "The HP-35s uses complex numbers for dealing with co-ordinates and azimuths & distances internally. In the event that dealing with complex numbers causes, well, complexity, programs that display complex numbers are also available in versions that don't display complex numbers (where that is a reasonable approach, but not solving quadratic equations). These programs are the 'A' version of each program, e.g., program Closure 1 displays complex numbers, but Closure 1A doesn't. Utility 1 (numbers 3, 4 and 5) do the conversion and so must deal with complex numbers. Seem complicated? See the document Complex Numbers, Vectors and Co-ordinates to sort this out, or be even more thoroughly confused!\n\nWorking with Memory\n\nThe HP-35s has the ability to address up to 801 storage locations beyond the basic 26 A..Z locations, the 6 statistical registers and the 4 stack locations. However, the locations must be addressed 'indirectly'. There are also some considerations to allocating and de-allocating memory, which you should be aware of if you are programming in a way that uses these indirectly addressed memory locations. See the document Programming and Working with Indirectly Addressed Memory on the HP-35s for more information about this, and some code to help with allocation and de-allocation of this memory.\n\nFree Training! HP offers Computer-based Training, virtual classrooms, downloadable material and other good stuff to help you get the most from your calculator. Click on the links below to get to the HP calculator website. There are links there to get you around what HP have on offer. At present, the offerings for the HP-35s are limited to Usage Guides, but this may change over time. There is a basic CBT module for the HP-35s, available for both PC and Mac.\n\nAlthough the HP-35s allows you much more flexibility with labels, there is a trick to get one more program in. Write the program so that it is at the very top of program memory, i.e., press GTO . . then press R/S. This is documented in the manual.\n\nAs you can do something like XEQ Z057 and run a program starting at that line number, there isn't a lot of need for this trick, provided you can remember the starting line numbers! One approach is to have a simple 'menu' that allows the user to pick from a series of options, displayed one at a time, and upon the choice being made, jump to that line and execute. This is the approach taken with the plane triangle solution program.\n\nSpecial Item!! With the release of the the HP-35s, we have to re-think how we deal with 2-D spatial location data, because the traditional decomposition of traverse data from azimuth and distance into rectangular components is not easy to implement on this calculator. This represents a major change from the lineage that stretches back to the HP-25 of the late 1970s.\n\nWith the HP-35s, we have to think of 2-D vectors as complex numbers, as that is how the calculator works with them. Fortunately, complex numbers are far better integrated in the HP-35s than in the HP-33S. The document linked above provides an overview of the relationships between complex numbers, vectors and traverses, as well as some routines to help with basic operations of complex numbers that are not built into the calculator.\n\nThis website will be updated as I write more software for the HP-35s, and convert other programs to run on this calculator. So check this site out from time to time to see what else has been added.\n\nSpecial News – Bug Reports in the HP-35s!! It appears that some HP-35s calculators have a tendency to lock up completely in some special situations. Details of this are still very sketchy at this stage (17th October, 2007), but the problem appears rare and in the earlier calculators. For details, see the posting at this URL:"}

The presentation of topics is unthreatening, user-friendly, and concise with excellent examples to support concepts and special cases. Applications were well chosen to prepare students with practical skills for employment.\"\n\n\"We adopted this book because it gave a heavy application approach to mathematics without overwhelming the student in 'traditional' algebra. It has been a huge success, as the number of students successfully passing this course has increased over the previous course.\"\n\n\"I believe that their [the author's] goals are in line with the goals for the national mathematical organizations, our state's goals, the course goals, and our class goals. The students get an extensive covering of applications, with enough algebraic content to balance the course out nicely.\"\n\n\"One of my favorite ideas of this book is the continual stressing of linear functions. This book definitely 'overkills' the concept of linear equations and functions, and that's a good thing. By the time the students finish the course, they have a firm grasp of this topic and how to use it, which gives them the flexibility and confidence to handle other functions in a similar manner"}

{"text": "Graphs are mathematical entities whose theory facilitates the discussion of the relationships between the elements of a set. Introduced about 1870 by the pioneers of combinatorics who were then still known as geometers, graphs have recently been recognized as the most adaptable tools for certain organizational problems. After first being used in operations research, graphs have now been introduced into information theory where they have proved to ba of use in many different areas. ...\n\nThis book stresses the connection between, and the applications of, design theory to graphs and codes. Beginning with a brief introduction to design theory and the necessary background, the book also provides relevant topics for discussion from the theory of graphs and codes. ...Algorithmic Graph Theory and Perfect Graphs, first published in 1980, has become the classic introduction to the field. This new Annals edition continues to convey the message that intersection graph models are a necessary and important tool for solving real-world problems. It remains a stepping stone from which the reader may embark on one of many fascinating research trails.\n\nAs graph theory continues its explosive growth, conjectures are proved and new theorems formed. The techniques involved, which have applications in a broad spectrum of mathematics, ranging from analysis to operations research, have become more sophisticated if not more manageable. This new edition, therefore, includes new theorems (e.g. the Perfect Graph Theorem, due to Lovasz) as well as new proofs of classical results. A number of sections have been significantly revised. ...\n\nGraphs and Matrices provides a welcome addition to the rapidly expanding selection of literature in this field. As the title suggests, the book's primary focus is graph theory, with an emphasis on topics relating to linear algebra and matrix theory. Information is presented at a relatively elementary level with the view of leading the student into further research. In the first part of the book matrix preliminaries are discussed and the basic properties of graph-associated matrices highlighted.The Graphs and Models series by Bittinger, Beecher, Ellenbogen, and Penna is known for helping students \"see the math\" through its focus on visualization and technology. These books continue to maintain the features that have helped students succeed for years: focus on functions, visual emphasis, side-by-side algebraic and graphical solutions, and real-data applications.\n\nThis book is concerned with the relations between graphs, error-correcting codes and designs, in particular how techniques of graph theory and coding theory can give information about designs. A major revision and expansion of a previous volume in this series, this *** includes many examples and new results as well as improved treatments of older material. So that non-specialists will find the treatment accessible the authors have included short introductions to the three main topics. This book will be welcomed by graduate students and research mathematicians and be valuable for advanced courses in finite combinatorics. ..."}

{"text": "In this Unit we deal with trigonometric identities. These identities are particularly useful in doing the algebra of trigonometry. In this application of the identities complex expressions are simplified and converted into different equivalent forms. This algebraic nature of trigonometry is taught at secondary school level, not only as a stepping stone towards further tertiary studies, which may require some form of trigonometry knowledge, but also as a tool to develop learners' logical reasoning.\n\nOften learners don't know how to start to prove an identity without any hint, even if they know every trigonometric formula. In this unit we will explore some general ideas to prove an identity, and in doing so provide an opportunity for you to pass this on to your learners, in order to improve their mathematics problem solving skills.\n\nThe usual approach to identities is the memorisation of the basic identities with little or no reference to the graphical meaning of the identities. The learners are then expected to be able to substitute and manipulate to prove given more complex identities. In this module we will try to give some graphical interpretation of the use of identities."}

{"text": "Synopses & Reviews\n\nPublisher Comments:\n\nBEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995.

Understanding\nthese basic mathematical operations is crucial to everything covered both in\nPre-Algebra and in more complicated mathematics. It is impossible to master\nthe complex principles of Pre-Algebra without first mastering the operations\nand their properties.\n\nYou are probably used to working with the four basic operations, but there are\nsome things about these operations that you may not know. In particular, these\noperations have certain properties that can make evaluating complex\nexpressions a lot easier.\n\nThe first section will explain how to correctly evaluate a\ncomplicated expression using the Order of Operations,\nwhich specifies the order in which to carry out operations when evaluating an\nexpression. The Order of Operations is important to know; if you do not follow\nit correctly and instead carry out the operations in the incorrect order,\nyour answer will also be incorrect.\n\nSection two will teach some properties\nof addition that will make it easier to evaluate an expression without\ndepending on a calculator. These properties are the Commutative\nProperty, the Associative Property, and the\nIdentity Property.\n\nThe third section will teach some\nproperties of multiplication. Like addition, multiplication has its own\nversion of the Commutative Property, the Associative Property, and the Identity\nProperty. Multiplication has two additional properties--the Zero Product\nProperty and the Distributive Property.\n\nThe fourth and final section will\ndiscuss inverse operations, which \"reverse\" other operations. These will\nbe especially useful for future algebra.\n\nEach section will teach something about basic operations that will help you\nevaluate expressions correctly and easily. These properties will also be\nuseful when you approach more difficult topics in pre-algebra, such as\nsolving an algebraic equation for a variable."}

Algorithm design strategies — exhaustive search, backtracking, divide-and-conquer and a few others — are general approaches to designing step-by-step instructions for solving problems. Analysis techniques are methods for investigating such procedures to answer questions\nabout the ultimate result of the procedure or how many steps are executed before the procedure stops. The discussion is an elementary level, with puzzle examples, and requires neither programming nor mathematics beyond a secondary school level. Thus, the tutorial provides a gentle and entertaining introduction to main ideas in high-level algorithmic problem solving.\n\nThe second and main part of the book contains 150 puzzles, from centuries-old classics to newcomers often asked during job interviews at computing, engineering, and financial companies. The puzzles are divided into three groups by their difficulty levels. The first fifty puzzles in the Easier Puzzles section require only middle school mathematics. The sixty puzzle of average difficulty and forty harder\npuzzles require just high school mathematics plus a few topics such as binary numbers and simple recurrences, which are reviewed in the tutorial.\n\nAll the puzzles are provided with hints, detailed solutions, and brief comments. The comments deal with the puzzle origins and design or analysis techniques used in the solution.

See if you can understand it: Wikipedia.\n\nComplex analysis will certainly help, but I think the real meat and potatoes is in a general field of mathematics that some people refer to as Abstract Algebra.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\n\nQuote by V0ODO0CH1LD\n\nThanks! Would you say I should learn complex analysis first or abstract algebra? Or are the two unrelated enough that it won't matter?\n\nThe two have small intersection at the introductory level. Neither are prerequisites for the other. But I have found that there are junior level complex analysis classes, while algebra does not come till senior level.\n\nThe two have small intersection at the introductory level. Neither are prerequisites for the other. But I have found that there are junior level complex analysis classes, while algebra does not come till senior levelRight, since complex analysis is not considered on the main track, some people take algebra without ever having taken complex analysis. There is some flexibility in paths through a math department.\n\nFor instance, a computer scientist might conceivably take algebra (maybe combinatorics is even more likely) but not complex analysis, while the the closely related field of electrical engineering might use more from complex analysis.There's a formula for 2nd degree equations -- quadratics. There's a formula for third-degree equations (cubics). There's a formula for fourth degree equations (quartics). But there is NO general formula for solving 5th degree equations or higher.\n\nTo learn about that, you'd study abstract algebra.\n\nWhat you'd learn from complex analysis is a proof that every polynomial of degree n has n complex roots. But there are other proofs that don't explicitly use complex analysis. But from complex analysis you'd understand why the n roots of the polynomial zn = 1 are the vertices of a regular n-gon in the plane -- a very cool fact indeed.\n\nSo it sounds like you'd be more interested in abstract algebra if you want to learn about formulas for finding roots; and complex analysis if you're interested in the roots in general.\n\nHere's a fascinating article about the beautiful images you get when you plot all the roots of various classes of polynomials."}

{"text": "Synopses & Reviews\n\nPublisher Comments:\n\nBEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995. He is a full-time Associate Professor at Palomar College and has taught there for the past 9 years. He is a member of AMATYC and regularly attends the national AMATYC and ICTCM conferences. He has also done extensive reviewing and testing of various classroom technologies and materials. Through this work, he is committed to teaching his students through applications and using technology to help his students both understand the mathematics in context and communicate their results clearly. Intermediate algebra is one of his favorite courses to teach, and he continues to teach several sections of this course each year.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\"This book has just the right balance of skill and application problems.It does a good job of helping the students throughout the sectionswithout just giving all the answers away.\"Kate Bella, Instructor, Manchester Community College \"It is easily readable for students, the explanations are clear, and themargin notes are a nice feature that makes the text more reader friendly.\"Daniel Lopez, Instructor, Brookdale Community College \"I love how the text is centered on real-life situations.

{"text": "The following computer-generated description may contain errors and does not represent the quality of the book: In the preparation of this book, the aim of the authors has been to give the student a working knowledge of the elementary processes of algebra, with a conviction of the truth of principles through illustrations and particular examples. Each principle, or method, is therefore first clearly illustrated by numerous and simple exercises worked in the text. But the student is not left to assume that the principles are thereby proved. Even a beginner should not be encouraged, by textbook or teacher, to accept an illustrative example as a proof, or he will lose much of the educational value of the study. Particular attention has been paid to the grading of the exercises. The introductory chapter extends the familiar processes of arithmetic to the corresponding processes of algebra. The pupil is led by simple exercises, similar to those in arithmetic, to understand the use of letters to represent general and unknown numbers. Negative numbers are naturally introduced in connection with the extension of subtraction of arithmetical numbers. The meaning and use of positive and negative nimibers, in the fundamental operations, are properly emphasized. Equations and problems are distributed throughout the book. The importance of equivalent equations is not overlooked, but is very briefly and simply considered in Chapter IV. Until that chapter is reached, the solutions of equations should be checked."}

{"text": "8th Grade Algebra\n\nFor students: The Important Files (documents and power points) are located at the bottom of the page.\n\nOverview of 8th Grade Algebra\n\nGOALS: There are several major goals for students in Algebra: 1. to identify and define a function, 2. to graph and solve functions, 3. to perform operations with polynomials and factor them, 4. to apply the skills learned to real world problems, and 5. to use technology to assist us in solving and representing mathematical concepts.\n\nINTRO TO FUNCTIONS: Students begin the year introducing the concept of functions. We define functions and relations and learn various ways to represent relations-- equations, graphs, tables, and mapping diagrams. From those representations, we identify what relations are and are not functions.\n\nLINEAR FUNCTIONS:The first family of functions we study is linear functions. We investigate the various general equations to represent these functions such as slope-intercept form, standard form, direct variation form, and point-slope form. We learn how to graph these functions in these different forms and convert from one form to another. We practice writing equations to represent real world situations, graph data, and interpret what these graphs of these functions mean. We use both Microsoft Excel and graphing calculators to apply skills we learn in this unit. We culminate this unit with a chapter project in which students collect data from an experiment they design.\n\nLINEAR SYSTEMS:We extend our investigation of linear functions by studying linear systems. We learn what a solution of a linear system means and study various methods of how to solve a linear system. Students write a persuasive essay of which method they feel is the best way to solve a linear system.\n\nINEQUALITIES:Students review the basic concept of inequalities and analyze what their solutions mean graphically. They learn about a new type of inequality--an absolute value inequality. They also learn how to graph inequalities on the coordinate plane.\n\nPOLYNOMIALS:We shift from functions and graphing to defining polynomials. We first learn how to perform operations with polynomials and then we learn various methods of factoring polynomials. We will analyze various polynomials and determine which method is necessary to factor them.\n\nQUADRATIC FUNCTIONS & EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS: We finally move on to new families of functions other than linear! We examine the famililes of quadratic and exponential functions and learn their equations and graphic patterns. We also learn how to solve quadratic and exponential equations using a variety of methods. All of these skills are applied to word problems involving quadratic functions.\nTECHNOLOGY:Graphing calculators will be used throughout the year to enhance our study of functions. Microsoft Excel will also be used to show another method of graphing data.\n\nEND OF THE YEAR EXAM: Students will take an Algebra Acuity Test at the end of the year for the Archdiocese. Neither I nor the Archdiocese make the exam. It is made through a computer program that the Archdiocese hired. What we learn throughout the year will prepare the students for the exam. Certain high schools within the Archdiocese ask for the exam scores to determine math placement. However, public schools and other private schools do not typically ask to see these scores.We will most likely not cover every single concept on the exam but that is typical. I give more information as the exam approaches toward the end of May.\n\nSETUP: There is a focus on vocabulary. Students must keep up with the key terms in the vocabulary section of their notebooks. There are several quizzes throughout a chapter. Quizzes involve vocabulary and word problems. There is a major test at the end of a chapter. There are some projects and/or writing assignments throughout the year."}

{"text": "You are here\n\nMathematics Secondary Media\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: By developing a function to describe the annual cost of a refrigerator and given a function describing concentration of drug in the body, students relate the behavior of the graph of a rational function with the phenomenon it describes. Asymptotes and particular points become important information about the application.\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: Using the CBL and the graphing calculator, students work in groups to collect data describing the freefall of an object over time. The data collected includes data not relevant and that must be eliminated, and data is shifted near the y-axis to make the intercept meaningful. The students describe the meaning of the coefficients. The experiment is run again with an object that has drag (like a hat) and a model is found. The follow-up problem works with the football data from the lesson: Football and Braking Distance: Model Data with Quadratic Functions.\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: Using the definition of complex numbers and operations with complex numbers, students add, multiply, and graph with complex numbers using some sample items from the NC Algebra II Indicators. Once familiar with the operations and graphing, students iterate complex numbers in functions to determine whether the iteration stabilizes. With some experimentation, rules are developed that show patterns in stabilization that carry into graphs by special coloring schemes. The result is a fractal. Examples from the Julia Set and the Mandelbrot Set are shown.\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: Concepts of composition are used to develop functions that describe volumes of pyramids with specific bases and combinations of special discounts when purchasing a car. The connection between study time and number of courses leads to a function using inverse function that can help students determine the number of courses to take for available weekly study time.\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: Using rulers, students measure distances on a diagram to find a shortest path. They create ordered pairs and a scatterplot. With the motivation that the scatterplot has a clear message, the students develop a function that measures the distances using the distance formula. Based on the function, the shortest distance can be estimated and then considered on the diagram. A follow-up problem involving determining the best place to put a new Post Office is included.\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: Data representing the period of a swinging pendulum versus the length of the pendulum can be best modeled by a square root function. Data and an appropriate model are both given to the students. Questions from the NC Algebra II Indicators require students to solve equations involving radical expressions. Solutions are also investigated from both a graphical and an analytical point of view.\n\nAlgebra 2 lesson: Students are given data to describe the trajectory of a football tossed from the tallest bleachers of a stadium. The data is fit with a quadratic function using least squares criteria. Given data extracted from page 288 of Glencoe's Algebra II book, students investigate braking distance versus speed of a car. Using quadratic least squares, the student finds a best-fit function for the data. Data is given on reaction distance versus speed of the car. When reaction distance is added to braking distance to find total stopping distance, students fit another quadratic function. A Follow Up Problem relates number of sides of a polygon with the number of vertices to create a quadratic function."}

A comparison between exponential and power functions follows, which leads to methods for determining the (p) value in the power function (h(x) = kx^p) and the value of the base( b) in the exponential function (f(x) = ab^x). A procedure for solving exponential equations is presented before a population application problem is solved.

{"text": "Complex Numbers in n Dimensions\n\nTwo distinct systems of hypercomplex numbers in n dimensions are introduced in this book, for which the multiplication is associative and commutative, and which are rich enough in properties such that exponential and trigonometric forms exist and the concepts of analytic n-complex function, contour integration and residue can be defined. The first type of hypercomplex numbers, called polar hypercomplex numbers, is characterized by the presence in an even number of dimensions greater or equal to 4 of two polar axes, and by the presence in an odd number of dimensions of one polar axis. The other type of hypercomplex numbers exists as a distinct entity only when the number of dimensions n of the space is even, and since the position of a point is specified with the aid of n/2-1 planar angles, these numbers have been called planar hypercomplex numbers. The development of the concept of analytic functions of hypercomplex variables was rendered possible by the existence of an exponential form of the n-complex numbers. Azimuthal angles, which are cyclic variables, appear in these forms at the exponent, and lead to the concept of n-dimensional hypercomplex residue. Expressions are given for the elementary functions of n-complex variable. In particular, the exponential function of an n-complex number is expanded in terms of functions called in this book n-dimensional cosexponential functions. of the polar and respectively planar type, which are generalizations to n dimensions of the sine, cosine and exponential functions. In the case of polar complex numbers, a polynomial can be written as a product of linear or quadratic factors, although it is interesting that several factorizations are in general possible.

{"text": "8th Grade Algebra\n\nFor students: The Important Files (documents and power points) are located at the bottom of the page.\n\nOverview of 8th Grade Algebra\n\nGOALS: There are several major goals for students in Algebra: 1. to identify and define a function, 2. to graph and solve functions, 3. to perform operations with polynomials and factor them, 4. to apply the skills learned to real world problems, and 5. to use technology to assist us in solving and representing mathematical concepts.\n\nINTRO TO FUNCTIONS: Students begin the year introducing the concept of functions. We define functions and relations and learn various ways to represent relations-- equations, graphs, tables, and mapping diagrams. From those representations, we identify what relations are and are not functions.\n\nLINEAR FUNCTIONS:The first family of functions we study is linear functions. We investigate the various general equations to represent these functions such as slope-intercept form, standard form, direct variation form, and point-slope form. We learn how to graph these functions in these different forms and convert from one form to another. We practice writing equations to represent real world situations, graph data, and interpret what these graphs of these functions mean. We use both Microsoft Excel and graphing calculators to apply skills we learn in this unit. We culminate this unit with a chapter project in which students collect data from an experiment they design.\n\nLINEAR SYSTEMS:We extend our investigation of linear functions by studying linear systems. We learn what a solution of a linear system means and study various methods of how to solve a linear system. Students write a persuasive essay of which method they feel is the best way to solve a linear system.\n\nINEQUALITIES:Students review the basic concept of inequalities and analyze what their solutions mean graphically. They learn about a new type of inequality--an absolute value inequality. They also learn how to graph inequalities on the coordinate plane.\n\nPOLYNOMIALS:We shift from functions and graphing to defining polynomials. We first learn how to perform operations with polynomials and then we learn various methods of factoring polynomials. We will analyze various polynomials and determine which method is necessary to factor them.\n\nQUADRATIC FUNCTIONS & EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS: We finally move on to new families of functions other than linear! We examine the famililes of quadratic and exponential functions and learn their equations and graphic patterns. We also learn how to solve quadratic and exponential equations using a variety of methods. All of these skills are applied to word problems involving quadratic functions.\nTECHNOLOGY:Graphing calculators will be used throughout the year to enhance our study of functions. Microsoft Excel will also be used to show another method of graphing data.\n\nEND OF THE YEAR EXAM: Students will take an Algebra Acuity Test at the end of the year for the Archdiocese. Neither I nor the Archdiocese make the exam. It is made through a computer program that the Archdiocese hired. What we learn throughout the year will prepare the students for the exam. Certain high schools within the Archdiocese ask for the exam scores to determine math placement. However, public schools and other private schools do not typically ask to see these scores.We will most likely not cover every single concept on the exam but that is typical. I give more information as the exam approaches toward the end of May.\n\nSETUP: There is a focus on vocabulary. Students must keep up with the key terms in the vocabulary section of their notebooks. There are several quizzes throughout a chapter. Quizzes involve vocabulary and word problems. There is a major test at the end of a chapter. There are some projects and/or writing assignments throughout the year."}

By considering the example you should be able to draw out and clarify your ideas of mathematical modelling.\n\nThis unit, the second in a series of five, builds a real-world system – the Great Lakes – where mathematical modelling has been used to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen if changes are made. The system concerned is extremely complex but, by keeping things as simple as possible, sufficient information will be extracted to allow a mathematical model of the system to be obtained.\n\nJust as we usually take for granted the basic arithmetical operations with real numbers, so we usually assume that, given any positive real number a, there is a unique positive real number b = such that b2 = a.

{"text": "New developments in many applications, such as weather forecasting, airplane design, tomographic problems, analysis of the stability of structures, design of chips and other electrical circuits, etc, rely on numerical simulations. Such simulations require the numerical solution of linear systems or of eigenvalue problems. The matrices involved are sparse and high dimensional (1 billion is not acceptional). The solution of these linear problems are normally by far the most time-consuming part of the whole simulation. Therefore, the development of new solution algorithms is extremely important and forms a very active area of research. The course will give an overview of the modern solution algorithms for linear systems and eigenvalue problems. Modern approaches rely on schemes that improve approximate solutions iteratively. The course will start with a review of basic concepts from linear algebra, after which solution methods for dense systems (LU, QR and Choleski decomposition) will be discussed. Next, the basic ideas for iterative solution methods of sparse systems will be explained, which will lead to the main topic of the course: modern Krylov subspace methods. The main ideas of these methods will be explained and how they lead to efficient solvers. Solution algorithms for linear systems that will be discussed include CG, GMRES, CGS, Bi-CGSTAB, Bi-CGSTAB(l) and IDR(s). Furthermore several preconditioning and deflation techniques will be explained. For large scale eigenvalue problems the Lanczos methods, Arnoldi's method and the Jacobi-Davidson method will be treated.\n\nOrganization\n\nFourteen lectures, each consisting of instruction and theoretical and practical assignments.

In this unit you are asked to relate the stages of the mathematical modelling process to another practical example, this time modelling the skid marks caused by vehicle tyres. By considering the example you should be able to draw out and clarify your ideas of mathematical modelling.\n\nThis unit, the second in a series of five, builds a real-world system – the Great Lakes – where mathematical modelling has been used to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen if changes are made. The system concerned is extremely complex but, by keeping things as simple as possible, sufficient information will be extracted to allow a mathematical model of the system to be obtained.\n\nJust as we usually take for granted the basic arithmetical operations with real numbers, so we usually assume that, given any positive real number a, there is a unique positive real number b = such that b2 = a.

However, [0, 2) has many upper bounds, for example, 2, 3, 3.5 and 157.1.

{"text": "The following computer-generated description may contain errors and does not represent the quality of the book: El Preface This book is the result of twenty years of patient experiment in actual teaching. It is intended to be completed in the first year of the high school. It presents algebraic equations primarily as a device for the solution of problems stated in words, and gives a complete treatment of numerical equations such as are usually included in high-school algebra one-letter and two-letter equations, integral and fractional, including one-letter quadratics and the linear-quadratic pair. So much of algebraic manipulation is included as is necessary for the treatment of these equations. The arithmetic in the book is presented from a new point of view that of approximate computation and is utilized in the evaluation of formulas and in the solution of equations throughout the succeeding pages. Geometrical facts are introduced as the basis of many algebraic and arithmetic problems, and wherever they are not intuitively accepted by the pupils they are accompanied by adequate logical demonstration. Proofs, and parts of proofs, are avoided when they seem to the pupils of an unnecessary and hair-splitting kind. Ah problems are carefully graded, for it is by means of problems that each successive algebraic difficulty is introduced. A great deal of pains has been taken to present new topics clearly and concretely, often dividing them into sub-topics each of which is separately illustrated and apphed to practice.

{"text": "Mathematics Department\n\nTeachers: Mr David Hobson, Mrs Heather Kingston, Mr Anthony Hibbard\n\nOverview Mathematics is a reasoning and creative activity employing abstraction and generalisation to identify, describe and apply patterns and relationships. It is a significant part of the cultural heritage of many diverse societies. The symbolic nature of mathematics provides a powerful, precise and concise means of communication. Mathematics incorporates the processes of questioning, reflecting, reasoning and proof. It is a powerful tool for solving familiar and unfamiliar problems both within and beyond mathematics. As such, it is integral to scientific and technological advances in many fields of endeavour. In addition to its practical applications, the study of mathematics is a valuable pursuit in its own right, providing opportunities for originality, challenge and leisure.\n\nThe study of mathematics provides opportunities for students to learn to describe and apply patterns and relationships; reason, predict and solve problems; calculate accurately both mentally and in written form; estimate and measure; and interpret and communicate information presented in numerical, geometrical, graphical, statistical and algebraic forms. Mathematics provides support for concurrent learning in other key learning areas and builds a sound foundation for further mathematics education.\n\nStudents will have the opportunity to develop an appreciation of mathematics and its applications in their everyday lives and in the worlds of science, technology, commerce, the arts and employment. The study of the subject enables students to develop a positive self-concept as learners of mathematics, obtain enjoyment from mathematics, and become self-motivated learners through inquiry and active participation in challenging and engaging experiences.\n\nThe ability to make informed decisions, and to interpret and apply mathematics in a variety of contexts, is an essential component of studentsí preparation for life in the twenty-first century. To participate fully in society students need to develop the capacity to critically evaluate ideas and arguments that involve mathematical concepts or that are presented in mathematical form.\n\nMathematics as part of the curriculum Mathematics is compulsory for Year 7-10 and is streamed in each class according to individuals ability levels. General Mathematics, 2 Unit, 3 Unit and 4 Unit Mthematics are offered in Year 11 and 12.\n\nRecommended homework hours Year 7-8 should spend approximately 1-2 hours per week on mathematics homework. Year 9-10 should spend approximately 2-3 hours per week and Year 11-12 should spend approximately 3-4 hours per week."}

{"text": "Teaching Overview\n\nHuman beings have a natural desire to do things as well as possible. And when there are several possibilities of doing something, they try to choose the best alternative they can afford. This desire requires two different skills: one needs to decide on the aspects of the real-world that are relevant for the problem context, to recast them in an abstract optimization model, to find an optimal solution to this model, and to reflect on the effects of the implementation process of this optimal solution in real-life. This procedure is embedded in a larger process that is called Operations Research (or System Design and Optimization).

{"text": "Detailed Description of this Course Algebra seems hard to many students simply because every topic builds upon one another. What usually happens is that the student will understand the first few topics in the course, then fall behind once variables are introduced. After this point many students don't really understand the purpose of variables in algebra but continue moving along in the course until a point is reached where it is impossible to understand further topics with out a solid grasp of the basics.\n\nThe Algebra 1 Tutor series is designed assuming that you know absolutely nothing about Algebra. We begin at the very beginning of the sequence of topics with a review of fractions and exponents and gradually move through variables, expressions, and equations. What sets our tutorials apart is that every single topic is taught by showing fully worked example problems in a step-by-step fashion.\n\nThis technique has proven to be extremely effective and has helped thousands of students from around the world learn Algebra with our video lessons. What you'll find is that once you begin to understand the topics, your confidence will improve in Algebra. Then, instead of fearing the subject you'll truly begin to see that it is very logical, approachable, and that you can check your work on virtually every single problem."}

This book will provide an enjoyable and accessible introduction to algorithmic puzzles that will develop the reader's algorithmic thinking.\n\nThe first part of this book is a tutorial on algorithm design strategies and analysis techniques. Algorithm design strategies — exhaustive search, backtracking, divide-and-conquer and a few others — are general approaches to designing step-by-step instructions for solving problems. Analysis techniques are methods for investigating such procedures to answer questions\nabout the ultimate result of the procedure or how many steps are executed before the procedure stops. The discussion is an elementary level, with puzzle examples, and requires neither programming nor mathematics beyond a secondary school level. Thus, the tutorial provides a gentle and entertaining introduction to main ideas in high-level algorithmic problem solving.\n\nThe second and main part of the book contains 150 puzzles, from centuries-old classics to newcomers often asked during job interviews at computing, engineering, and financial companies. The puzzles are divided into three groups by their difficulty levels. The first fifty puzzles in the Easier Puzzles section require only middle school mathematics. The sixty puzzle of average difficulty and forty harder\npuzzles require just high school mathematics plus a few topics such as binary numbers and simple recurrences, which are reviewed in the tutorial.\n\nAll the puzzles are provided with hints, detailed solutions, and brief comments. The comments deal with the puzzle origins and design or analysis techniques used in the solution. The book should be of interest to puzzle lovers, students and teachers of algorithm courses, and persons expecting to be given puzzles during job interviews.\n\nReadership: Students and teachers of algorithm courses, puzzle enthusiasts, and anyone wishing to learn more about how to solve puzzles and/or develop algorithmic thinking\n\nAnany Levitin is a professor of Computing Sciences at Villanova University.

The specific outcome of a successful pre-algebra experience is the establishment and full integration of algebraic law that defines and supports all algebraic processes of simplifying and solving. The most crucial component of successful instruction and learning is to include all of the incremental steps in every algebraic development. Therefore, course emphasis is on the systematic incrementation and methods of instruction that address the development, refinement, and integration of students' sensory-cognitive abilities with the application and retention of algebraic problem solving and skills.\n\nTopics include units on the four operations with integers and rational numbers, probability, number theory, ratio, proportion and percent, solving equations, and linear graphing. This course is designed for educational therapists, special educators, elementary and secondary classroom teachers, and college professors. Parents and those who consider themselves non-math majors are especially encouraged to enroll.

{"text": "Transition Mathematics\n\nMain goal: The main goal of Transition Mathematics is to act as a stepping-stone between the processes learned in Pre-Transition Mathematics or Everyday Mathematics 6 to the material presented in UCSMP Algebra and UCSMP Geometry. Transition Mathematics incorporates applied arithmetic, algebra, and geometry; and connects all these areas to measurement, probability, and statistics.\n\nMain theme I: Arithmetic skills and concepts are reinforced by continuous instruction in the uses of the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Basic skills and number sense practice are reinforced by applications and the conversions among decimals, fractions, and percents, with both positive and negative numbers.\n\nPicturing multiplication by 2.5 and by 0.8\n\nMain theme II: The algebra in Transition Mathematics begins with the uses of variables in formulas, as pattern-generalizers, and as unknowns in solving problems. Graphing lines in the coordinate plane and the solving of linear equations and inequalities are developed.\n\nMain theme III: The geometry in Transition Mathematics includes the use of transformations to demonstrate congruence, similarity, symmetry, and tessellations. Length, perimeter, area, and volume are studied as general concepts and with specific attention to common two- and three-dimensional figures. Drawing and constructions with and without the use of technology are both strongly encouraged throughout the text.\n\nComparisons between this and earlier editions: The reality orientation of the material and the overall approach of this groundbreaking book remain. Some of the content in the first and second editions of Transition Mathematics has been moved to Pre-Transition Mathematics due to (1) the existence of Everyday Mathematics and the general increase in the performance of students coming into middle school, (2) increased expectations for the performance of all students in both middle and high schools and the concomitant increased levels of testing, and (3) recommendations for more algebra and geometry in middle school courses preceding year-long courses in algebra and geometry. Calculators with graphing and list features are introduced early as pattern-fitting and problem-solving tools. Spreadsheets and dynamic geometry systems are found in activities throughout the materials. Students are engaged and learning is reinforced with the use of games."}

{"text": "The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of AlgebraI think that by asking these types of questions you will help yourself to understand complex concepts intuitively. So keep it up.\n\nThe quadratic formula gives us the real and complex roots of a 2nd degree polynomial. We can not use it to solve higher degree polynomials.\n\nSometimes the quadratic will just give us one answer for x. This is a case where we have found a root with multiplicity 2. This concept is a bit tough to explain. Here is a link to give an exact definition. See if you can understand it: Wikipedia.\n\nComplex analysis will certainly help, but I think the real meat and potatoes is in a general field of mathematics that some people refer to as Abstract Algebra.\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\n\nQuote by V0ODO0CH1LD\n\nThanks! Would you say I should learn complex analysis first or abstract algebra? Or are the two unrelated enough that it won't matter?\n\nThe two have small intersection at the introductory level. Neither are prerequisites for the other. But I have found that there are junior level complex analysis classes, while algebra does not come till senior level.\n\nThe two have small intersection at the introductory level. Neither are prerequisites for the other. But I have found that there are junior level complex analysis classes, while algebra does not come till senior levelRight, since complex analysis is not considered on the main track, some people take algebra without ever having taken complex analysis. There is some flexibility in paths through a math department.\n\nFor instance, a computer scientist might conceivably take algebra (maybe combinatorics is even more likely) but not complex analysis, while the the closely related field of electrical engineering might use more from complex analysis.There's a formula for 2nd degree equations -- quadratics. There's a formula for third-degree equations (cubics). There's a formula for fourth degree equations (quartics). But there is NO general formula for solving 5th degree equations or higher.\n\nTo learn about that, you'd study abstract algebra.\n\nWhat you'd learn from complex analysis is a proof that every polynomial of degree n has n complex roots. But there are other proofs that don't explicitly use complex analysis. But from complex analysis you'd understand why the n roots of the polynomial zn = 1 are the vertices of a regular n-gon in the plane -- a very cool fact indeed.\n\nSo it sounds like you'd be more interested in abstract algebra if you want to learn about formulas for finding roots; and complex analysis if you're interested in the roots in general.\n\nHere's a fascinating article about the beautiful images you get when you plot all the roots of various classes of polynomials."}

Graphing lines in the coordinate plane and the solving of linear equations and inequalities are developed.\n\nMain theme III: The geometry in Transition Mathematics includes the use of transformations to demonstrate congruence, similarity, symmetry, and tessellations. Length, perimeter, area, and volume are studied as general concepts and with specific attention to common two- and three-dimensional figures. Drawing and constructions with and without the use of technology are both strongly encouraged throughout the text.\n\nComparisons between this and earlier editions: The reality orientation of the material and the overall approach of this groundbreaking book remain. Some of the content in the first and second editions of Transition Mathematics has been moved to Pre-Transition Mathematics due to (1) the existence of Everyday Mathematics and the general increase in the performance of students coming into middle school, (2) increased expectations for the performance of all students in both middle and high schools and the concomitant increased levels of testing, and (3) recommendations for more algebra and geometry in middle school courses preceding year-long courses in algebra and geometry. Calculators with graphing and list features are introduced early as pattern-fitting and problem-solving tools. Spreadsheets and dynamic geometry systems are found in activities throughout the materials. Students are engaged and learning is reinforced with the use of games."}

The performance of a nonlinear solver is heavily dependent of parallel performance of linear solvers. Other methods are also used for solutions of nonlinear equations.

{"text": "Classical Applied Mathematics\n\nThe most traditional role of the applied mathematician in a professional setting has been in the solution of problems arising from physical phenomena and engineering. From its very inception, calculus has been applied to laws of motion and to understanding the consequences of interacting forces. While the early applied mathematicians were necessarily physicists and engineers as well, the modern setting calls for the mathematician to serve as a member of a team of specialists, each bringing a particular talent to bear on problems.\n\nIn a broad sense, the applied mathematician is instrumental in designing and analyzing models of systems and in testing and evaluating performance. It is a characteristic of this field that the technical questions readily move across once clearly distinguished boundaries. Whether in research and development or in industrial production, the applied mathematician must interact with engineers, physicists, programmers, and other specialists. The common goal is to find ways to improve quality, reduce cost, and increase productivity. The analytical skills of the mathematician are particularly valuable in consulting for technical services or trouble shooting.\n\nRecent mathematical research in combination with increasing computer sophistication has opened fields that saw little development in the past due to their intractability to classical analytic techniques. These include the solution of problems involving enormous numbers of equations, the numerical simulation of complex systems such as power grids, and the application of control theory and other mathematical tools to the management of traffic or industrial processes.\n\nThe tasks of the applied mathematician are as diverse as the constituencies served. The broad category of engineering disciplines is a rich source of mathematical problems. In the aeronautical field a mathematician may help to develop models for atmospheric flight including the analysis of performance in search of optimal trajectories. Biomedical engineers may rely on mathematicians when designing and interpreting theoretical models of chemical and biological processes. A mechanical engineer may require a study of heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation resulting from a gas turbine.\n\nMany problems involve scientific or engineering data and the use of computer techniques to answer questions arising in research, plant operations, product distribution systems, inventory controls, and business system analyses. Mathematicians seek efficient and reliable computer programs for the numerical solution of initial value problems or special function routines capable of delivering accurate answers over a wide range of parameters. While the methods most frequently applied are based in ordinary and partial differential equations, there is increasing involvement of probability, statistics, and computing.\n\nWhat should one study in college?\n\nFor a career in classical applied mathematics, a student should obtain a thorough background in calculus, linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations, probability, statistics, numerical analysis, and vector calculus. These courses should include some extensive use of computing, or they should be supplemented by appropriate courses in computer sciences. Supporting work should include physics and basic engineering courses.\n\nAdditional Resource:\n\nCareers in Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics, by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), at the weblink:"}

{"text": "introductory book on optimization (mathematical programming) includes coverage on linear programming, nonlinear programming, integer programming and heuristic programming; as well as an emphasis on model building using Excel and Solver. The emphasis on model building (rather than algorithms) is one of the features that makes this book distinctive. Most books devote more space to algorithmic details than to formulation principles. These days, however, it is not necessary to know a great deal about algorithms in order to apply optimization tools, especially when relying on the spreadsheet as a solution platform. The emphasis on spreadsheets is another feature that makes this book distinctive. Few books devoted to optimization pay much attention to spreadsheet implementation of optimization principles, and most books that emphasize model building ignore spreadsheets entirely. Thus, someone looking for a spreadsheet-based treatment would otherwise need to use a book that was designed for some other purpose, like a survey of management science topics, rather than one devoted to optimization. The model building emphasis derives from an attempt to be realistic about what readers need most when learning about optimization. At an introductory level, the most practical and motivating theme is the wide applicability of optimization tools. To apply optimization effectively, readers needs more than a brief exposure to a series of numerical examples, which is the way that most mathematical programming books treat applications. With a systematic modeling emphasis, readers can begin to see the basic structures that appear in optimization models and as a result, develop an appreciation for potential applications well beyond the examples in the book. Formulating optimization models is both an art and a science, and this book pays attention to both. The art can be refined with practice, especially supervised practice, just the way a student would learn sculpture or painting. The science is reflected in the structure that organizes the topics in this book. For example, there are several distinct problem types that lend themselves to linear programming formulations, and it makes sense to study these types systematically. In that spirit, the book builds a library of templates against which new problems can be compared. Analogous structures are developed for the presentation of other topics as well.\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nKenneth R. Baker, PHD, is Nathaniel Leverone Professor of Management at the Tuck School of Business and Adjunct Professor of Engineering at Dartmouth College.

{"text": "Incorporating a modeling approach throughout, this exciting text emphasizes concepts and shows that the study of differential equations is a beautiful application of the ideas and techniques of calculus to everyday life. By taking advantage of readily available technology, the authors eliminate most of the specialized techniques for deriving formulas for solutions found in traditional texts and replace them with topics that focus on the formulation of differential equations and the interpretations of their solutions. Students will generally attack a given equation from three different points of view to obtain an understanding of the solutions: qualitative, numeric, and analytic. Since many of the most important differential equations are nonlinear, students learn that numerical and qualitative techniques are more effective than analytic techniques in this setting. Overall, students discover how to identify and work effectively with the mathematics in everyday life, and they learn how to express the fundamental principles that govern many phenomena in the language of differential equations.\n\nBook Description:Brooks/Cole, CA, 2005.

The author presents a variety of solutions for the problems in the book. Some solutions reach back to the work of mathematicians like Leonhard Euler while others connect to other beautiful parts of mathematics. Readers will frequently see problems solved by using an idea that might at first glance, might not even seem to apply to that problem. Other solutions employ a specific technique that can be used to solve many different kinds of problems. Excursions emphasizes the rich and elegant interplay between continuous and discrete mathematics by applying induction, recursion, and combinatorics to traditional problems in classical analysis. The carefully selected assortment of problems presented at the end of the chapters includes 22 Putnam problems, 50 MAA Monthly problems, and 14 open problems.

{"text": "two halves, the first covering an undergraduate semester and the second a masters semester. It is thorough and pitched at the right level for those who need to master the basics and then move on to more advanced applications of the theory, but does not really make an effort to aid the reader's understanding by giving reasons for following developmental paths, or by providing any intuitive rationales that would have helped to see the machinery as it works rather just how it is put together.\n\nThis is the kind of book I've looked for as an undergraduate while taking my complex variables course. This book covers the fundamentals of complex analysis - analytic functions, integration, differentiation, infinite series and products, and residue calculus - using the oh-so-familiar but oh-so-very-effective method of theorem-proof-examples with short discussions inbetween. Since this text is so well organized this alone makes it a valuable asset. But this only comprises half of the book - the other half introduces uses of complex variables, including fourier series and transforms, asymptotic expansions, ordinary differential equations, Green's functions in potential theory and many other things - a real goldmine of information, for a very low price, too! Granted, you won't find graduate-level discussions here, but this isn't what this book is meant for - undergraduates. This isn't to say this book isn't rigorous - terms such as \"normal convergence\" and \"compact set\" do occur in the book. All-in-all, this has everything you'll need unless you intend to pursue higher-level courses in complex variables.\n\n10 of 10 people found the following review helpful\n\n5.0 out of 5 starsEssential Text16 April 2003\n\nBy A Customer - Published on Amazon.com\n\nFormat:Paperback\n\nA true treasure, this text outlines in a simple, concise and yet approachable manner for the undergraduate student, the topic of complex variables and functions. It also not only outlines the theory (in the first half) but also presents a wealth of applications from potential flow theory to asymptotic expansions. It must be noted that the development of the applications is rather rudimentary and I would not recommend this book as a reference in any of these subjects. One essential book for the undergraduate or graduate student in engineering, engineering-physics, etc, with strong inclincations for applied mathematics.\n\n6 of 7 people found the following review helpful\n\n4.0 out of 5 starsnice book, good for self-learning1 Dec 2009\n\nBy Liguo Kong - Published on Amazon.com\n\nFormat:Paperback|Amazon Verified Purchase\n\nI got this book and learned complex variable function from it. I like this book very much. It is well-organized. I read the first part of the book (theory part) carefully, and find it quite clear and approachable. For the application part, I read the Fourier and Laplace chapters and again enjoyed them, but I was confused when reading the last chapter, \"asymptotic expansions\".\n\nA little background in mathematical analysis might be helpful, but not necessary.

{"text": "My class just finished module 1 in our textbooks. Since it was the beginning of the year it was basically easy stuff and reviews but we still learned. Now that we are done with module 1 we can start to learn more advanced math. In module 1 there were six sections. Section 1 was about data displays, section 2 was about sequences and exponents, and in section 3 we learned about probability. Section 4 was about problem solving and section 5 and 6 were about problem solving and order of operations.\n\nIn section 1 we learned about tallying data, and bar and line graphs. When you tally data you are supposed to gather the data you want and tally how many times it comes up. A bar graph is a graph that is used to display data that falls into distinct categories. A line graph is graph that shows how data changes over time. That is what we learned in section 1 in module 1.\n\nIn section 2 we learned about modeling sequences and exponents, squares, and cubes. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers or objects called terms. We learned about term numbers and symbols also. Exponents show a pattern of repeated multiplication. Exponents make it simpler to write out as well. Instead of writing out 3.3.3.3 you could just write 34 or three to the fourth power.\n\nIn section 3 we were taught about probability and theoretical probability. Probability is experiments that predict the outcome of an event. Probability is also a number from 0 to 1 that tells you how likely something will happen.\n\nSection 4 was about problem solving. The textbook gave us four steps to problem solving. Step 1: understand the problem. Step 2: Make a Plan. Step 3: Carry out the plan. Step 4: look back, or check out work. Those were all very helpful to me, especially when I got stuck on a difficult math equation. This was definitely an important chapter to me.\n\nSection 5 in the textbook taught the class about evaluating solutions and making connections. Section 6 was about the order of operations. The order of operations helps when you do long mathematical equations.

{"text": "BEGINNING AND INTERMEDIATE ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS, shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students develop sound mathematical skills by learning how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. Authors Mark Clark and Cynthia Anfinson have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, the authors place an emphasis on developing strong algebra skills that support theMore... applications, enhancing student comprehension and developing their problem solving abilities. Second, applications are integrated throughout, drawing on realistic and numerically appropriate data to show students how to apply math and to understand why they need to know it. These applications require students to think critically and develop the skills needed to explain and think about the meaning of their answers. Third, important concepts are developed as students progress through the course and overlapping elementary and intermediate content in kept to a minimum. Chapter 8 sets the stage for the intermediate material where students explore the \"eyeball best-fit\" approach to modeling and understand the importance of graphs and graphing including graphing by hand. Fourth, Mark and Cynthia's approach prepares students for a range of courses including college algebra and statistics. In short, BEGINNING AND INTERMEDIATE ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS develops strong mathematical skills using an engaging, application-driven and problem solving-focused approach to algebra"}

{"text": "MAZ501: Discrete Math (2013-2014)\n\nMajor Concepts/Content: This discrete mathematics course by design shows a different view of mathematics than as seen in traditional mathematics courses. It is an applications driven course that is based upon the study of events that occur in small, or discrete, chunks. Discrete concepts are used extensively in business, industry, government, and the digital world. The major areas of study are counting and probability, graph theory, the mathematics of social choice (voting and fair division), and coding and encryption. Some of the questions investigated in discrete math are: What does a bar code mean? What is the most efficient way a delivery truck can visit ten destinations? Should you buy a lottery ticket?\n\nMajor Instructional Activities: Probability applications include predicting outcomes using combinations, permutations, and counting principles. Mathematics of social choice investigates election theory and fair division. The graph theory component is comprised of the following: (1) graphs and directed graphs- shortest paths and graph coloring; (2) various trees; and (3) circuits and networks. The role of coding and encryption in the digital world will be investigated. The concept of recursion is a strategy embedded throughout discrete studies. Concepts will be explored and simulated using a variety of technology tools.\n\nMajor Evaluative Techniques: The assessments, formal and informal, will be used to describe and identify student progression toward the discrete mathematics expectations. Students will be asked to demonstrate the depth of their knowledge through tasks which mirror realistic situations. Students will be required to develop verbal, written and technological skills in the process of solving the problem as well as use critical thinking in working towards a solution.\n\nCourse Objectives: Upon completion of the course, students will be able to use:\n\ngraphs of vertices and edges to model a problem situation.\n\ncritical path analysis to solve scheduling problems.\n\ngraph coloring techniques.\n\nminimal spanning trees to solve problems.\n\ncodes, including error-correcting codes, and decoding techniques.\n\nbin-packing techniques to solve problems.\n\ntree diagrams, Venn diagrams and other pictorial representations to find the number of outcomes in a problem situation"}

This free IIT JEE and CBSE online preparation lecture discusses a Complex Numbers question that appeared in IIT JEE 2009 papers. Algebra is a pretty vast unit, and Complex numbers is considered one of the most important and confusing topics from the unit. The reason why it is confusing is that after studying real numbers for so long, the concept of a number with a real and an imaginary part is very new. Topics like Arguments of a complex number are important and must be prepared properly. This IIT JEE video lecture would help you understand the techniques of solving complex numbers questions to some extent.

From 2013, a common entrance exam called JEE (initially called ISEET) would enter the picture which would give combined weightage to board exam scores and performance in a PCM advanced level test and an aptitude test. For the preparation of this entrance test it is important to score well in class 12 board exams. Use NCERT books strictly for the preparation of Physics and Chemistry. For Math, start with NCERT and then later you can move on to more advanced level IIT JEE books like TMH Maths, Hall and Knight, M.L Khanna etc. Make sure that you pay attention to your class curriculum right from class 11th, so that your fundamental concepts are strong. CBSE curriculum uses NCERT books; students from other boards can refer to their course books or NCERT books only. Practice a lot of questions to strengthen your problem solving skills using model test papers, CBSE question banks, CBSE sample papers, CBSE papers of previous years, IIT JEE practice papers etc. IIT JEE question banks, CBSE solved question papers, IIT JEE question papers of previous years etc. would give you a good idea of what kind of questions to expect in the exam. You can take help of online lectures and online portals as well to study. There are various online CBSE and IIT JEE portals that can help you manage exam-related stress and keep calm, in addition to helping you prepare. Your CBSE results or ISC results are more important than ever now, therefore avoid spending unnecessarily on expensive IIT JEE coaching institutes and fancy residential IIT coaching centres like the ones in Kota, and rather pay attention to your school curriculum.

{"text": "Throughout the history of mathematics, maximum and minimum problems have played an important role in the evolution of the field. Many beautiful and important problems have appeared in a variety of branches of mathematics and physics, as well as in other fields of sciences. The greatest scientists of the past--Euclid, Archimedes, Heron, the Bernoullis, Newton, and many others--took part in seeking solutions to these concrete problems. The solutions stimulated the development of the theory, and, as a result, techniques were elaborated that made possible the solution of a tremendous variety of problems by a single method.\n\nThis book presents fifteen \"stories\" designed to acquaint readers with the central concepts of the theory of maxima and minima, as well as with its illustrious history. This book is accessible to high school students and would likely be of interest to a wide variety of readers.\n\nIn Part One, the author familiarizes readers with many concrete problems that lead to discussion of the work of some of the greatest mathematicians of all time. Part Two introduces a method for solving maximum and minimum problems that originated with Lagrange. While the content of this method has varied constantly, its basic conception has endured for over two centuries. The final story is addressed primarily to those who teach mathematics, for it impinges on the question of how and why to teach. Throughout the book, the author strives to show how the analysis of diverse facts gives rise to a general idea, how this idea is transformed, how it is enriched by new content, and how it remains the same in spite of these changes."}

{"text": "The diagram at the left shows solution paths that result from using a concept-based approach to problem solving. There may be several possible concepts which respond to the question asked. These lead to different paths through solution space and draw on different concepts in knowledge space. A solution path consists of continuous, logically connected steps.\n\nDetails of a particular solution path for a problem are illustrated below.\n\nThe fundamental element of a problem solution is the REQUEST-RESPONSE-RESULT structure shown above. This is the familiar hierarchical arrangement commonly used in organizing information. Note that the solution presented above shows exactly what was actually done.\n\nThe expression to be evaluated is shown.\n\nThe values to be substituted are obtained.\n\nThese are substituted.\n\nThe result is calculated.\n\nThe typical textbook solution presentation omits step 1 above. The thing to be done\nis not included in the presentation. Thus the reason for obtaining the values chosen in step 2 is not known to the reader. The solution to a textbook problem is only partly shown on the printed page. Much of the conceptual development which the writer did is not shared with the reader.\n\nAnswer book solutions tend to focus on steps 3 and 4. Concepts are rarely shown as a basis for problem solutions in textbooks and answer books.\n\nSolutions to more complex problems involve the recursive use of the REQUEST-RESPONSE-RESULT structure.\nAn example is shown below and on other pages of this web.\n\nThe starting equation is the answer to the question Where to Start? This equation then tells one What to do Next.\nThis process is applied recursively by reading equations left-to-right, responding to requests made by the equations. This hierarchical use of REQUEST-RESPONSE-RESULT leads to the solution of the problem.\n\nUsing different solution paths and making different decisions at branches along the\npath leads to a variety of solution structures for a given problem. In this way one can explore a problem. It provides a way of finding the most elegant solution. This is the solution we show to others! By exploring a problem, one comes to understand the problem and the concepts and tools used to solve the problem.\n\nEach step of a problem requires a verbal statement of the reason for the step. The more challenging a problem is, the greater is the need for the verbal statement. Verbal statements form probes to locate information in one's knowledge space. Verbal statements inform others and one's \"self\" of the reasoning involved in solving a problem.\n\nMathematically, the solution consists of an organized, self-driven approach to solving simultaneous equations. Typical word problems consist of several conditions which must be satisfied simultaneously. For this reason problems in all subjects across the curriculum are solved in the same way. The words change, the symbols change, the ideas change but the problem solving process remains the same.\n\nThe diagrams above illustrate an essential feature of a problem solution. This is the indentation of subproblems. The provides a logical structure to the solution. The indentation process is used in a large number of areas for effective communication. Outlines,\nindexes, tables of contents, bulleted charts, and computer programming are a few example. Indentation serves to break a problem into smaller parts in coherent manner.\n\nThere has been a massive amount of research, mainly by the interview method, showing that students use the spaghetti approach to organizing a problem solution. This is a natural consequence of the emphasis on the spaghetti approach in early training in arithmetic and algebra."}

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required. In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems. The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places: mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables); exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12); Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2); confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2); hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2); elliptic integrals {9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions {3); Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13); combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11); probability functions (ll); scales of notation {6); miscellaneous functions {9); Laplace transforms (2); and others. Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over 100 figures illustrate the text. In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem solving, experimentation and field work.

{"text": "Applied Mathematics\n\nThe subject of mathematics is related to almost all the other subjects. The advancement in the fields of engineering, science, economics statistics etc. are facilitated by use of mathematics. In other words, the application of mathematics helps in development and easier understanding of topics in other subjects. The branch of mathematics that is used for such a purpose is called as applied mathematics. It may be noted that in this branch of math, the important terms and constants used in the other topics also form as parts.\n\nA car leaves an airport at 8 am and runs at an average velocity 45 mph. At 9 am another car leaves the same airport in the same direction and it has to meet the first car before noon. What should be the minimum average velocity with which the second car should run to achieve the necessity?\n\nThe situation described in the above physics problem is not very unusual. A person traveling in the first car might have left out something and his friend at the airport may like to reach that article. And by noon, the first person might reach his destination and may not be reachable thereafter. Let us see how applied mathematics helps us to solve. The velocity refers to the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Hence the distance traveled by the first car in the 4 hours (from 8 am to noon) is given by the mathematical equation d1 = v1* t1 = 45*4 = 180 miles, since we know that v1 = 45 mph and t1 = 4 hours. The concept of applied math is same for the second car but now the equation is d2 = v2* t2. But in this case the known values are d2 = 180 miles, since at the point of interception both cars must have traveled the same distance and out of necessity the maximum value of t2 can only be 3 hours (from 9 am to noon). Therefore, 180 = v2*3, which gives the solution as v2 = 60 mph.\n\nLet us study another problem related to physics but which can be considered as an applied mathematics. Two wires of ½ in. diameter are anchored at a ceiling roof as shown in the diagram. These wires are riveted to a hook which is used to hold heavy weights. The wires make angles of 45o and 60o with the ceiling. The wires have an ultimate tensile strength of 16T per sq.in. What could be the maximum weight that can be loaded on the hook?\n\nThe concept of this problem is used in material lifting equipment. Ultimate tensile strength of 16T/ sq.in. means the wire can take a load of only 16T for a cross section area of 1 in. Since the diameter of the wires are ½ in. each wire can take only a load of 16(π/4)(1/2)2 = π tons ≈ 3.14 tons. Now mathematically we can draw a vector diagram and find the solution. The same is drawn below.\n\nThe wires on the left and right take the loads that are the projection of the main load W in the direction of wires. Let those components be P and Q respectively. As per vector algebra, P = (√2)W/2 and Q = (√3)W/2. Obviously the magnitude of Q is greater and therefore it must be equal to 3.14T. Hence W can be equal to a maximum of 3.14/0.866 = 3.63T approximately.\n\nThe concept of matrices is widely used in statistical fields. We will give an introduction to matrices in our next topic.\n\nYou need to be a member of The Educator's PLN to add comments!\n\nUnless and until we apply our book knowledge into practical world we found it useless and uninteresting. If we are taught to learn things not just for reading books and solving mathematical problems but also by incorporating these ideas in to real life situations, the interest will develop.\n\nI never analyzed this concept of applied mathematics, It seems really great. Can that be applied to trigonometric problem solving too. I think this has much of application on work and energy concept of physics where a stress and strain calculation for a particular object or a bridge needs to be calculated. Hope I am right!!"}

{"text": "Best Fit Least-Squares (BFLS) is a required technique for many STEM subjects. It is a method to compute a linear model for a set of data points. Due to its utility, BFSL is frequently taught to STEM students before they have sufficient mathematical experience to follow the mechanics of a derivation. Not only does this fail to produce procedural and conceptual understandings, but also it encourages students to view formulae and algorithms as things to be looked up, rather than derived. This is discourages students from developing productive dispositions. In this paper, we describe the \"Close Fit Rod-Spring\" (CFRS) approach to the problem. This approach computes the resting position of a rigid rod, which is connected by vertically oriented springs to a set of data points. This method of derivation results in two linear equations that may be solved for the slope and intercept of the best fit line. The result is equivalent to BFSL. However, it is achieved in an intuitively understandable and mathematically accessible way for high school students."}

Functions and graphing are introduced early, in Chapter Three, and then integrated throughout the rest of the text. This approach allows for visual interpretation of the mathematical concepts which in turn encourages students to develop an intuitive understanding of equations and their graphs. Also by introducing these topics early, students become familiar and comfortable with concepts that are critical to their success in future math courses. \"Intermediate Algebra\" includes marginal notes and examples that indicate how technology can enhance the study of algebra through exploration, visualization and geometric interpretation. The examples allow students to see the connection between algebra and the more intuitive graphic representation. They fall at the end of section discussions and may be omitted if a graphing tool is not being used. The text is written in a clear, concise style with numerous examples which are connected by thoughtful transitions that either reinforce the student's understanding of the previous concepts or prepare them for the next example. Each example is followed by a \"Check Yourself\" exercise that facilitates the student's active involvement in the learning"}

{"text": "0072355calculus\n\nMathematical reform is the driving force behind the organization and development of this new precalculus text. The use of technology, primarily graphing utilities, is assumed throughout the text. The development of each topic proceeds from the concrete to the abstract and takes full advantage of technology, wherever appropriate. The first major objective of this book is to encourage students to investigate mathematical ideas and processes graphically and numerically, as well as algebraically. Proceeding in this way, students gain a broader, deeper, and more useful understanding of a concept or process. Even though concept development and technology are emphasized, manipulative skills are not ignored, and plenty of opportunities to practice basic skills are present. A brief look at the table of contents will reveal the importance of the function concept as a unifying theme. The second major objective of this book is the development of a library of elementary functions, including their important properties and uses. Having this library of elementary functions as a basic working tool in their mathematical tool boxes, students will be able to move into calculus with greater confidence and understanding. In addition, a concise review of basic algebraic concepts is included in Appendix A for easy reference, or systematic review. The third major objective of this book is to give the student substantial experience in solving and modeling real world problems. Enough applications are included to convince even the most skeptical student that mathematics is really useful. Most of the applications are simplified versions of actual real-world problems taken from professional journals and professional books. No specialized experience is required to solve any of the"}

Since we are not developing theory and proofs, we have not been obliged to conform to a strict logical ordering of topics. Instead, topics have been organized for ease of reference, so that cognate topics appear in one place.

The primary tool presented throughout Optimization for Profit is linear programming (LP)--a medium that can be mastered by any individual who seeks to improve his/her analytical and decisionmaking skills.One of the special features of Optimization for Profit is the illustration of activity analysis as the technique used to formulate problems. By using activity analysis as the problem structure, linear programming become a natural extension of the way decision makers approach problems. As a result, linear programming becomes an integral part of the thinking process of the individual. Consequently, students or practitioners can readily create a linear programming model of an entire business or any part of a business. Several chapters are devoted to describing this technique and illustrating its application to many different types of companies, including an oil refinery, a marmalade production company, and a chicken processing plant. A thorough study of Optimization for Profit will enable you to work with any manufacturer or service industry and model all or part of the operation, and then solve the model to determine how best to minimize costs or maximize profits.

The stronger the students, the harder the exercises that can be assigned. The book can be used for one--quarter, two--quarter, or one--semester course depending on how much material is used. Combinatorical reasoning underlies all analysis of computer systems. It plays a similar role in discrete operations research problems and in finite probability. This book teaches students in the mathematical sciences how to reason and model combinatorically. It seeks to develop proficiency in basic discrete math problem solving in the way that a calculus textbook develops proficiency in basic analysis problem solving. The three principle aspects of combinatorical reasoning emphasized in this book are: the systematic analysis of different possibilities, the exploration of the logical structure of a problem (e.g. finding manageable subpieces or first solving the problem with three objects instead of n), and ingenuity. Although important uses of combinatorics in computer science, operations research, and finite probability are mentioned, these applications are often used solely for motivation. Numerical examples involving the same concepts use more interesting settings such as poker probabilities or logical games.Hide synopsis\n\nDescription:Fine. Hardcover. Almost new condition.

{"text": "Incorporating a modeling approach throughout, this exciting text emphasizes concepts and shows that the study of differential equations is a beautiful application of the ideas and techniques of calculus to everyday life. By taking advantage of readily available technology, the authors eliminate most of the specialized techniques for deriving formulas for solutions found in traditional texts and replace them with topics that focus on the formulation of differential equations and the interpretations of their solutions. Students will generally attack a given equation from three different points of view to obtain an understanding of the solutions: qualitative, numeric, and analytic. Since many of the most important differential equations are nonlinear, students learn that numerical and qualitative techniques are more effective than analytic techniques in this setting. Overall, students discover how to identify and work effectively with the mathematics in everyday life, and they learn how to express the fundamental principles that govern many phenomena in the language of differential equations."}

{"text": "Linear Programming and Its Applications (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)\n\nThe effectiveness of the algorithms of linear programming in solving problems is largely dependent upon the particular applications from which these problems arise. A first course in linear programming should not only allow one to solve many different types of problems in many different contexts but should provide deeper insights into the fields in which linear programming finds its utility. To this end, the emphasis throughtout Linear Programming and Its Applicationsis on the acquisition of linear programming skills via the algorithmic solution of small-scale problems both in the general sense and in the specific applications where these problems naturally occur. The first part of the book deals with methods to solve general linear programming problems and discusses the theory of duality which connects these problems. The second part of the book deals with linear programming in different applications including the fields of game theory and graph theory as well as the more traditional transportation and assignment problems. The bookis versatile; in as much as Linear Programming and Its Applications is intended to be used as a first course in linear programming, it is suitable for students in such varying fields as mathematics, computer science, engineering, actuarial science, and economics.\n\n\"C.

They research the population of the 10 largest cities in their state and use this functional relationship to calculate the number of barrels and gallons of oil used by each city.\n\nStarting from a brief look at functions and the mapping of domains to ranges, Sal starts out with an intuitive sense of what a function inverse is. He then, using an example, shows how to find the inverse of a function and also shows how the graph of the function and its inverse are reflections over the y = x line. This video provides a good review of function inverses for more advanced students or a nice introduction for the beginning student.\n\nAre odd numbers connected to odd functions and even numbers to even functions? This video tries to clarify that connection. It also talks about functions that are neither odd nor even to give a more intuitive feeling about classifying these functionsWe look at a number of different examples of functions and see what their domain is. Sal writes the domain in set notion and shows how different functions can have different input values that cause the function to be undefined.\n\nAfter defining a simple function from a word problem, this video, shows how one could find the domain and the range of that function. The goals here are to reinforce the definitions of domain and range with a concrete example.\n\nCollaborative learners will see the geometric addition of functions by graphing the sum of two graphed curves on the same coordinate plane. This task then naturally flows into giving learners the algebraic representation of the curves and having them build a table of values at various inputs with outputs of the two functions and their sum.\n\nStudents solve formulas by using substitution.

{"text": "as the bridge to cross the widening gap between mathematics and computer science, and planned as the mathematical base for computer science students, this maths text is written for upper-level college students who have had previous coursework involving proofs and proof techniques. The close tie between the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of graph theory, and graphs that lend themselves naturally as models in computer science, results in a need for efficient algorithims to solve any large scale problems. Each algorithm in the text includes explanatory statements that clarify individual steps, a worst-case complexity analysis, and algorithmic correctness proofs. As a result, the student will develop an understanding of the concept of an efficient algorithm."}

Three principal aspects of combinatorial reasoning are emphasized in this book: the systematic analysis of different possibilities, the exploration of the logical structure of a problem, and ingenuity. Keeping theory to a minimum, it uses numerical examples to demonstrate the combinatorial reasoning involved in computer science, operations research, and finite probability. This edition gives more attention to computer science's use of combinatorics. Includes a new chapter on topics in theoretical computer science, a new section on recursive programs, an enlarged discussion of algorithms to generate combinatorial sets, and additional programming exercises.\n\nHardcover, ISBN 0471863718 Publisher: Wiley1863718 Publisher: Wiley, 1994 Used - Good, Usually ships in 1-2 business days, Minimal damage to cover and binding.

{"text": "Shipping prices may be approximate. Please verify cost before checkout.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nIf you've ever tried to solve mathematical problems without any idea how to go about it, this book is for you. It will improve your ability to solve all kinds of mathematical problems whether in mathematics, science, engineering, business, or purely recreational mathematical problems (puzzles, games, etc.). In the pages of this book you'll discover seven indispensable problem-solving techniques: inference, classification of action sequences, state evaluation and hill climbing, subgoals, contradiction, working backward and relations between problems. Based on modern advances in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer simulation of thought, the techniques are taught here by an effective problem-solving methodology. Dr. Wickelgren, formerly a Professor of Psychology at MIT and the University of Oregon, first defines a problem-solving method, then illustrates its application to simple recreational mathematics problems that require no more background than a year of high school algebra and a year of plane geometry. By devoting the majority of the book to such \"puzzle\" problems, which require less background and information than more advanced mathematics and science problems, the author reaches the widest possible audience. In the final chapter, however, Dr. Wickelgren deals with specific problems from mathematics, science, and engineering. Throughout the book, sample problems illustrate each method and the author has supplied hints and complete solutions. Carefully and clearly written, this indispensable guide will help students in every discipline avoid countless hours of frustration and wasted effort. It is an ideal book for early undergraduate courses in mathematics, physical science, engineering, computer science, economics and other fields that require problem solving. Preface. Introduction.

{"text": "Product Details\n\nSee What's Inside\n\nProduct Description\n\nThe distributive principle is one of the most important and widely used concepts in mathematics. Though interlaced with other mathematical concepts, it provides a spotlight on major educational and mathematical themes. It is a significant tool in seeking ways of relating algebraic and geometric thinking and of expanding their very different potential to formulate generalizations. Stephen Brown, through his research, writings, and practice in the classroom, has discovered the deep and powerful educational and mathematical implications of applying the distributive principle as a way to encourage students to relate mathematics to the \"real world,\" to seek connections beyond science and mathematics, and to include literature and language as ways of expanding their mathematical thinking.\n\nThis extraordinary collection of essays, each of which uses the distributive principle to shed light on a different aspect of mathematical thought, encourages readers to find new ways of understanding the significance and limitations of a subject that is usually presented as purely logical and not often connected with how the mind works in other domains. Using the distributive property as a vantage point, the essays cast a wide net. For example, in one essay the connections between algebraic and geometric variations of the property are developed in the context of presenting enticing problems. Though prime numbers are part of the curriculum (in such diverse topics as the infinitude of primes, the unique factorization of composites into a product of primes, and the ability to reduce all fractions to \"lowest terms\"), in focusing on the distributive property, the author expands on the concept of prime numbers in ways that point out the deep significance of concepts that are often prematurely taken for granted.Related ProductsNovember 2013 Focus Issue: Beginning Algebra: Teaching Key Concepts\nHow can all students learn the key concepts of beginning algebra?

{"text": "Applied Mathematics\n\nThe subject of mathematics is related to almost all the other subjects. The advancement in the fields of engineering, science, economics statistics etc. are facilitated by use of mathematics. In other words, the application of mathematics helps in development and easier understanding of topics in other subjects. The branch of mathematics that is used for such a purpose is called as applied mathematics. It may be noted that in this branch of math, the important terms and constants used in the other topics also form as parts.\n\nA car leaves an airport at 8 am and runs at an average velocity 45 mph. At 9 am another car leaves the same airport in the same direction and it has to meet the first car before noon. What should be the minimum average velocity with which the second car should run to achieve the necessity?\n\nThe situation described in the above physics problem is not very unusual. A person traveling in the first car might have left out something and his friend at the airport may like to reach that article. And by noon, the first person might reach his destination and may not be reachable thereafter. Let us see how applied mathematics helps us to solve. The velocity refers to the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Hence the distance traveled by the first car in the 4 hours (from 8 am to noon) is given by the mathematical equation d1 = v1* t1 = 45*4 = 180 miles, since we know that v1 = 45 mph and t1 = 4 hours. The concept of applied math is same for the second car but now the equation is d2 = v2* t2. But in this case the known values are d2 = 180 miles, since at the point of interception both cars must have traveled the same distance and out of necessity the maximum value of t2 can only be 3 hours (from 9 am to noon). Therefore, 180 = v2*3, which gives the solution as v2 = 60 mph.\n\nLet us study another problem related to physics but which can be considered as an applied mathematics. Two wires of ½ in. diameter are anchored at a ceiling roof as shown in the diagram. These wires are riveted to a hook which is used to hold heavy weights. The wires make angles of 45o and 60o with the ceiling. The wires have an ultimate tensile strength of 16T per sq.in. What could be the maximum weight that can be loaded on the hook?\n\nThe concept of this problem is used in material lifting equipment. Ultimate tensile strength of 16T/ sq.in. means the wire can take a load of only 16T for a cross section area of 1 in. Since the diameter of the wires are ½ in. each wire can take only a load of 16(π/4)(1/2)2 = π tons ≈ 3.14 tons. Now mathematically we can draw a vector diagram and find the solution. The same is drawn below.\n\nThe wires on the left and right take the loads that are the projection of the main load W in the direction of wires. Let those components be P and Q respectively. As per vector algebra, P = (√2)W/2 and Q = (√3)W/2. Obviously the magnitude of Q is greater and therefore it must be equal to 3.14T. Hence W can be equal to a maximum of 3.14/0.866 = 3.63T approximately.\n\nThe concept of matrices is widely used in statistical fields. We will give an introduction to matrices in our next topic.\n\nYou need to be a member of The Educator's PLN to add comments!\n\nUnless and until we apply our book knowledge into practical world we found it useless and uninteresting. If we are taught to learn things not just for reading books and solving mathematical problems but also by incorporating these ideas in to real life situations, the interest will develop.\n\nI never analyzed this concept of applied mathematics, It seems really great. Can that be applied to trigonometric problem solving too. I think this has much of application on work and energy concept of physics where a stress and strain calculation for a particular object or a bridge needs to be calculated. Hope I am right!!"}

{"text": "Description This DVD teaches students how to easily tackle basic math word problems, and builds upon the foundation laid by the 1st - 7th Grade Math Tutor DVD.\n\nAfter students learn a math skill such as multiplication or division, many are frequently confused on how to apply these skills to solve word problems. Word problems present the problem to be solved in sentence form, and in these types of problems the student must pull the information out of the problem and decide the best way to solve it. The only way to get good at solving these types of problems is to practice, and that is what this 8 hour DVD course provides.\n\nEach type of problem is devoted to a dedicated section on the DVD for easy reference. Every section is taught entirely by example word problems which helps the students learn these skills in the most efficient way possible.\n\nThis DVD contains essential material to do well in Math because mastering word problems teaches the student how to think about the logic of a problem and decide the best course of action to arrive at the solution. These types of problems usually have many different ways to arrive at the answer and are more like problems encountered in the real world. These skills are used time again in more advanced courses such as Pre-algebra and Algebra. Each topic in this DVD course is introduced by working example problems, beginning with the easier problems and gradually working the harder ones. In this way the student immediately gains confidence in his or her abilities and improves homework and exam taking skills.\n\nHow are the MathTutorDVD.com line of DVDs different from others? The answer is simple. Most math instruction involves a lengthy discussion of the abstract theory behind the Math before instructing the student in how to solve problems. While there are some merits to this style, in the vast majority of the cases the student quickly gets bored and frustrated by the time he or she starts to solve the problems. This DVD, in contrast, teaches all of the concepts by working fully narrated problems step-by-step, which is a much more engaging way to learn.\n\nExceptional value and affordability. MathTutorDVD.com believes in providing value for our customers. This is a 8 Hour DVD course. We could have easily split this content into many DVD courses each costing the same price but instead chose to keep the cost down so that this content is affordable to all.\n\nWhat is our teaching style like? All topics on this DVD are taught by working example problems. There are no traditional lectures of background material that won't help you solve problems and improve your skills. We believe in teaching-by-doing and that is what you will receive by watching this DVD. Word problems involving fractions is explained, for example, by working many problems in step-by-step detail. We begin with the easier problems and work our way up to the harder problems. The student immediately gains confidence, does not get bored, and quickly feels like he or she can conquer the material. This method is extremely powerful and has proven itself time and again. Perhaps most importantly, problem solving skills are honed early on that will help with homework and taking exams even after watching the very first lesson."}

(Hide tip)]\n\nThis unit is devoted solely to complex numbers.\n\nIn Section 1, we define complex numbers and show you how to manipulate them, stressing the similarities with the manipulation of real numbers.\n\nSection 2 is devoted to the geometric representation of complex numbers. You will find that this is very useful in understanding the arithmetic properties introduced in Section 1.\n\nIn Section 3 we discuss methods of finding nth roots of complex numbers and the solutions of simple polynomial equations.\n\nThe final two sections deal with inequalities between real-valued expressions involving complex numbers. First we use inequalities in Section 4 to describe various subsets of the complex plane. Then we show, in Section 5, how to prove such inequalities. In particular, we introduce the Triangle Inequality, which can be used to obtain an estimate for the size of a given complex expression"}

{"text": "Applied Mathematics\n\nThe subject of mathematics is related to almost all the other subjects. The advancement in the fields of engineering, science, economics statistics etc. are facilitated by use of mathematics. In other words, the application of mathematics helps in development and easier understanding of topics in other subjects. The branch of mathematics that is used for such a purpose is called as applied mathematics. It may be noted that in this branch of math, the important terms and constants used in the other topics also form as parts.\n\nA car leaves an airport at 8 am and runs at an average velocity 45 mph. At 9 am another car leaves the same airport in the same direction and it has to meet the first car before noon. What should be the minimum average velocity with which the second car should run to achieve the necessity?\n\nThe situation described in the above physics problem is not very unusual. A person traveling in the first car might have left out something and his friend at the airport may like to reach that article. And by noon, the first person might reach his destination and may not be reachable thereafter. Let us see how applied mathematics helps us to solve. The velocity refers to the rate of change of distance with respect to time. Hence the distance traveled by the first car in the 4 hours (from 8 am to noon) is given by the mathematical equation d1 = v1* t1 = 45*4 = 180 miles, since we know that v1 = 45 mph and t1 = 4 hours. The concept of applied math is same for the second car but now the equation is d2 = v2* t2. But in this case the known values are d2 = 180 miles, since at the point of interception both cars must have traveled the same distance and out of necessity the maximum value of t2 can only be 3 hours (from 9 am to noon). Therefore, 180 = v2*3, which gives the solution as v2 = 60 mph.\n\nLet us study another problem related to physics but which can be considered as an applied mathematics. Two wires of ½ in. diameter are anchored at a ceiling roof as shown in the diagram. These wires are riveted to a hook which is used to hold heavy weights. The wires make angles of 45o and 60o with the ceiling. The wires have an ultimate tensile strength of 16T per sq.in. What could be the maximum weight that can be loaded on the hook?\n\nThe concept of this problem is used in material lifting equipment. Ultimate tensile strength of 16T/ sq.in. means the wire can take a load of only 16T for a cross section area of 1 in. Since the diameter of the wires are ½ in. each wire can take only a load of 16(π/4)(1/2)2 = π tons ≈ 3.14 tons. Now mathematically we can draw a vector diagram and find the solution. The same is drawn below.\n\nThe wires on the left and right take the loads that are the projection of the main load W in the direction of wires. Let those components be P and Q respectively. As per vector algebra, P = (√2)W/2 and Q = (√3)W/2. Obviously the magnitude of Q is greater and therefore it must be equal to 3.14T. Hence W can be equal to a maximum of 3.14/0.866 = 3.63T approximately.\n\nThe concept of matrices is widely used in statistical fields. We will give an introduction to matrices in our next topic.\n\nYou need to be a member of The Educator's PLN to add comments!\n\nUnless and until we apply our book knowledge into practical world we found it useless and uninteresting. If we are taught to learn things not just for reading books and solving mathematical problems but also by incorporating these ideas in to real life situations, the interest will develop.\n\nI never analyzed this concept of applied mathematics, It seems really great. Can that be applied to trigonometric problem solving too. I think this has much of application on work and energy concept of physics where a stress and strain calculation for a particular object or a bridge needs to be calculated. Hope I am right!!"}

{"text": "Introduction\n\nIn this unit we look at some different systems of numbers, and the rules for combining numbers in these systems. For each\nsystem we consider the question of which elements have additive and/or multiplicative inverses in the system. We look at solving\ncertain equations in the system, such as linear, quadratic and other polynomial equations.\n\nIn Section 1 we start by revising the notation used for the rational numbers and the real numbers, and we list their arithmetical properties. You will meet other properties of these numbers in the analysis units, as the\nstudy of real functions depends on properties of the real numbers. We note that some quadratic equations with rational coefficients,\nsuch as x2 = 2, have solutions which are real but not rational.\n\nIn Section 2 we introduce the set of complex numbers. This system of numbers enables us to solve all polynomial equations, including those with no real solutions, such as x2 + 1 = 0. Just as real numbers correspond to points on the real line, so complex numbers correspond to points in a plane,\nknown as the complex plane.\n\nIn Section 3 we look further at some properties of the integers, and introduce modular arithmetic. This will be useful in the group theory units, as some sets of numbers with the operation of modular addition or modular\nmultiplication form groups.\n\nIn Section 4 we introduce the concept of a relation between elements of a set. This is a more general idea than that of a function, and leads us to a mathematical structure\nknown as an equivalence relation. An equivalence relation on a set classifies elements of the set, separating them into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nAfter studying this unit you should be able to:\n\nunderstand the arithmetical properties of the rational and real numbers;\n\nunderstand the definition of a complex number;\n\nperform arithmetical operations with complex numbers;\n\nrepresent complex numbers as points in the complex plane;\n\ndetermine the polar form of a complex number;\n\nuse de Moivre's Theorem to find the nth roots of a complex number and to find some trigonometric identities;\n\nunderstand the definition of ez, where z is a complex variable;\n\nexplain the terms modular addition and modular multiplication;\n\nuse Euclid's Algorithm to find multiplicative inverses in modular arithmetic, where these exist;\n\nexplain the meanings of a relation defined on a set, an equivalence relation and a partition of a set;\n\ndetermine whether a given relation defined on a given set is an equivalence relation by checking the reflexive, symmetric and transitive properties;\n\nunderstand that an equivalence relation partitions a set into equivalence classes;"}

The three principle aspects of combinatorical reasoning emphasized in this book are: the systematic analysis of different possibilities, the exploration of the logical structure of a problem (e.g. finding manageable subpieces or first solving the problem with three objects instead of n), and ingenuity. Although important uses of combinatorics in computer science, operations research, and finite probability are mentioned, these applications are often used solely for motivation. Numerical examples involving the same concepts use more interesting settings such as poker probabilities or logical games"}

It is an amazing book. Though some of the codes for the worked example needed some slight modification when using MATLAB 2011b, most of them were just fine.\n\nThis book does an *excellent* job of both explaining and demonstrating each and every step in image processing. Being a newbie to Matlab myself, I found the book extremely informative and most importantly very helpful in getting the things I needed to get done, done. Perhaps the simple things more advanced Matlab users take for granted, the newbie can easily grasp. I had a couple of things I wanted to do related to my research and this book saved me hours of frustration.\n\nI was looking for a book to help me analyze images in Matlab and I found this book.

Geometric algebra offers a simple and robust means of expressing a wide range of ideas in mathematics, physics, and engineering. In particular, geometric algebra extends the real number system to include the concept of direction, which underpins much of modern mathematics and physics. Much of the material presented has been developed from undergraduate courses taught by the author over the years in linear algebra, theory of numbers, advanced calculus and vector calculus, numerical analysis, modern abstract algebra, and differential geometry. The principal aim of this book is to present these ideas in a freshly coherent and accessible manner.\n\nThe book begins with a discussion of modular numbers (clock arithmetic) and modular polynomials. This leads to the idea of a spectral basis, the complex and hyperbolic numbers, and finally to geometric algebra, which lays the groundwork for the remainder of the text.

When it comes to the deepest part of the theory, the Complex Inversion Formula, a knowledge of poles, residues, and contour integration of meromorphic functions is required. To this end, an entire chapter is devoted to the fundamentals of complex analysis. In addition to all the theoretical considerations, there are numerous worked examples drawn from engineering and physics. When applying the Laplace transform, it is important to have a good understanding of the theory underlying it, rather than just a cursory knowledge of its application. This text provides that understanding"}

{"text": "5. COURSE DESCRIPTION :\nScientific Computing is concerned with harnessing the power of modern computers to carry out calculations relevant to science and engineering. By its very nature, scientific computing is a fundamentally multidisciplinary subject. The various application areas give rise to mathematical models of the phenomena being studied. Examples range in scale from the behaviour of cells in biology, to flow and combustion processes in a jet engine, to the formation and development of galaxies. Mathematics is used to formulate and analyse numerical methods for solving the equations that come from these applications. Implementing the methods on modern, high performance computers requires good algorithm design to produce efficient and robust computer programs. Competence in scientific computing thus requires familiarity with a range of academic disciplines. The practitioner must, of course, be familiar with the application area of interest, but it is also necessary to understand something of the mathematics and computer science involved. The fast development of hardware and software has significantly increased the importance of large scale computation in the community.. Through computer simulation and optimization of mathematical models the time for design and control of new products and processes can be reduced considerably. From the earliest days of the discipline, numerical methods and the techniques of scientific computing have constituted a major area of computer science research\n\nThe course describes how numerical analysis differs from analytical analysis and shows where each has special advantages. The great advantage for numerical analysis is that a numerical answer can be obtained even when a problem has no \"analytical solution\". Explains why computers and numerical analysis are intimately related. In modern scientific computing one can now treat more complex and less simplified problems through massive amounts of numerical calculations.\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES PSG MCA\n\nThe primary objective of this course is to provide you with a concrete idea of what numerical methods are and how they relate to engineering and scientific problem solving. Specific objectives and topics covered are\nLearning how mathematical models can be formulated on the basis of scientific principles to simulate the behavior of a simple physical system.\nUnderstanding how numerical methods afford a means to generate solutions in a manner that can be implemented on a digital computer.\nTo give students practice in analyzing the behavior of the constructed models by computer simulation using MATLAB software package.\nTo give the confidence to tackle numerical solutions\nInterpret the results and compare with physical intuition.\nDefine error, stability, machine precision concepts. and the inexactness of computational approximations.\nApply the fundamental techniques of operations research.\nDescribe several established techniques for prediction and estimation.\nTo sensitize them to the often neglected economic or societal constraints.\nTo equip them with the habit of always comparing different models based on their relative utility in analysis and design.\nTo develop their ability to communicate with co-workers from other engineering as well as non-engineering disciplines."}

This course is a continuation and extension of the two courses that preceded it. While developing the algebraic techniques that will be required of those students that continue their study of mathematics, this course is also intended to continue developing alternative solution strategies and algorithms. For example, technology can provide to many students the means to address a problem situation to which they might not otherwise have access. Within this course, the number system will be extended to include imaginary and complex numbers. The families of functions to be studied will include polynomial, absolute value, radical, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Problem situations involving direct and indirect variation will be solved. Problems resulting in systems of equations will be solved graphically and algebraically. Algebraic techniques will be developed to facilitate rewriting mathematical expressions into multiple equivalent forms. Data analysis will be extended to include measures of dispersion and the analysis of regression that model functions studied throughout this course. Associated correlation coefficients will be determined, using technology tools and interpreted as a measure of strength of the relationship. Arithmetic and geometric sequences will be expressed in multiple forms, and arithmetic and geometric series will be evaluated. Binomial experiments will provide the basis for the study of probability theory and the normal probability distribution will be analyzed and used as an approximation for these binomial experiments. Right triangle trigonometry will be expanded to include the investigation of circular functions. Problem situations requiring the use of trigonometric equations and identities will also be investigated.\n\nThe following chart lists the concepts and skills in Geometry (2005 Core) and indicates where it was included in the 1999 Core."}

Presented from the point of view of modern work in the field, this new book addresses advanced topics in complex analysis that verge on current areas of research, including invariant geometry, the Bergman metric, the automorphism groups of domains, harmonic measure, boundary regularity of conformal maps, the Poisson kernel, the Hilbert transform, the boundary behavior of harmonic and holomorphic functions, the inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations, and the corona problem.\n\nThe author adroitly weaves these varied topics to reveal a number of delightful interactions. Perhaps more importantly, the topics are presented with an understanding and explanation of their interrelations with other important parts of mathematics: harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, potential theory, abstract algebra, and invariant theory. Although the book examines complex analysis from many different points of view, it uses geometric analysis as its unifying theme.\n\nThis methodically designed book contains a rich collection of exercises, examples, and illustrations within each individual chapter, concluding with an extensive bibliography of monographs, research papers, and a thorough index.

But the system can be made to cope with points involving negative coordinates, such as (−2, 3) or (−2, −3). Just as a number line can be extended to deal with negative numbers, the x-axis and y-axis can be extended to deal with negative coordinatesPie charts are representations that make it easy to compare proportions: in particular, they allow quick identification of very large proportions and very small proportions. They are generally based on large sets of data.\n\nThe pie chart below summarises the average weekly expenditure by a sample of families on food and drink. The whole circle represents 100% of the expenditure. The circle is then divided into 'segments', and the area of each segment represents a fraction or pe climate change draws attention to the power of human activity to transform the planet in its entirety, and it is brought into sharp focus by the predicament of low-lying islands like Tuvalu. As we have seen in this unit, the issue of rising sea level and other potential impacts of changing global climate also point to the transformations in the physical world that occur even without human influence. Oceanic islands provide a particularly cogent reminder that the living things wit project, or single, team consists of a group of people who come together as a distinct organisational unit in order to work on a project or projects. The team is often led by a project manager, though self-managing and self-organising arrangements are also found. Quite often, a team that has been successful on one project will stay together to work on subsequent projects. This is particularly common where an organisation engages repeatedly in projects of a broadly similar nature – forOnce a small number of chains have been started, propagation involves successive addition of monomer units to achieve chain growth.

{"text": "Relationships can be any association between sets of numbers while functions have only one output for a given input. This tutorial works through a bunch of examples of testing whether something is a valid function. As always, we really encourage you to pause the videos and try the problems before Sal does!\n\nWhat values can you and can you not input into a function? What values can the function output? The domain is the set of values that the function is defined for (i.e., the values that you can input into a function). The range is the set of values that the function output can take on.\nThis tutorial covers the ideas of domain and range through multiple worked examples. These are really important ideas as you study higher mathematics.\n\nWhether you are talking about how force relates to acceleration or how the cost of movie tickets relates to the number of people going, it is not uncommon in this universe for things to vary directly. Similarly, when you are, say, talking about how hunger might relate to seeing roadkill, things can vary inversely.\nThis tutorial digs deeper into these ideas with a bunch of examples of direct and inverse variation.\n\nYou've already graphed functions when you graphed lines and curves in other topics so this really isn't anything new. Now we'll do a few more examples in this tutorial, but we'll use the function notation to make things a bit more explicit.\n\nThis is a super fun tutorial where we'll evaluate expressions that involve functions. We'll add, subtract, multiply and divide them. We'll also do composite functions which involves taking the output of one function to be the input of another one!\nAs always, pause the video and try the problem before Sal does!\n\nFunctions associate a set of inputs with a set of outputs (in fancy language, they \"map\" one set to another). But can we go the other way around? Are there functions that can start with the outputs as inputs and produce the original inputs as outputs? Yes, there are! They are called function inverses!\nThis tutorial works through a bunch of examples to get you familiar with the world of function inverses.\n\nAre you bored of the traditional operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division? Do even exponents seem a little run-of-the-mill?\nWell in this tutorial, we will--somewhat arbitrarily--define completely new operators and notation (which are essentially new function definitions without the function notation). Not only will this tutorial expand your mind, it could be the basis of a lot of fun at your next dinner party!\n\nThese oldie-but-maybe-goodies are the original function videos that Sal made years ago for his cousins. Despite the messy handwriting, some people claim that they like these better than the new ones (they claim that there is a certain charm to them). We'll let you decide."}

While there is no one correct order for teaching a maths syllabus, I am a keen advocate of teaching from the start to the end of a book when it presents topics in a suitable order. This book may certainly be used in this manner. Everything is well explained, with plenty of examples, well-chosen exercises, and good use of colour. Students and teachers will also appreciate the GDC examples that use the modern TI-Nspire calculator. Finally I should mention the CD, which among other things contains the whole book and instructions for using Casio and TI-84 calculators. David Getling, Mathematics Teacher, Amazon Review The book looks amazing! I can't wait to get the inspection copy. It looks very user friendly and complete. It is so ironic to see the GDC section with steps outlined as I was working on my own handout for the students. This is wonderful! Melani Decelles, IB Mathematics Teacher, Kelvin High School, Canada The book is great. I'm an IB Standard Level Maths teacher and I've already recommended it to my students as it is so much better than the out-of-date text book provided by the school! Mathematics SL Teacher, Amazon Review The committee thinks the books are well written, easy to follow, and they like the TI-NSpire technology throughout Education Ministry, Canada We have ordered the Mathematics SL and Mathematical Studies books, and we love them.

{"text": "This unit explores reasons for studying mathematics, practical applications of mathematical ideas and aims to help you to recognize mathematics when you come across it. It introduces the you to the graphics calculator, and takes you through a series of exercises from the Calculator Book, Tapping into Mathematics With the TI-83 Graphics Calculator. The unit ends by asking you to reflect on the process of studying mathematics.\n\nIn order to complete this unit you will need 4 we prove that some of the properties of the groups appearing earlier in the unit are, in fact, general properties shared by all groups. In particular, we prove that in any group the identity element is unique, and that each element has a unique inverse.\n\nThe modulus function provides us with a measure of distance that turns the set of complex numbers into a metric space in much the same way as does the modulus function defined on R. From the point of view of analysis the importance of this is that we can talk of the closeness of two complex numbers. We can then define the limit of a sequence of complex numbers in a way which is almost identical to the definition of the limit of a real sequence. Another analogue of real analysis arises 1 we formally define real functions and describe how they may arise when we try to solve equations. We remind you of some basic real functions and their graphs, and describe how some of the properties of these functions are featured in their graphs.\n\nMany problems are best studied by working with real functions, and the properties of real functions are often revealed most clearly by their graphs. Learning to sketch such graphs is therefore a useful skill, even though computer packages can now perform the task. Computers can plot many more points than can be plotted by hand, but simply 'joining up the dots' can sometimes give a misleading picture, so an understanding of how such graphs may be obtained remains important. The object ofMailing or discussion lists are email-based discussion groups. When you send an email to a mailing list address, it is sent automatically to all the other members of the list.\n\nThe majority of academic-related mailing lists in the UK are maintained by Jiscmail. You will find details of joining these mailing lists on the Jiscmail website. Mailing lists are useful for getting in touch with like-minded colleagues. They are also handy for keeping up to date with current thinking and research further difference between communitarians and cosmopolitans arises over the question of retributive justice. Communitarians think that it is the responsibility of each state to uphold justice. Collectively, states can pursue international justice through the auspices of the UN, and are answerable to each other, to public opinion and to NGOs. However, there is no basis for claims to universal jurisdiction, and to deal with matters not found in specific states (such as piracy), or that cross second source of criticisms that we would like to explore comes from feminist critiques. Some feminists argue that the universal notion of rights makes invisible the special problems faced by women as a group, and that, thereby, specific articles of the various human rights declarations and conventions reinforce traditional gender roles in the family and the workplace. This criticism comes in at least two forms.\n\nThe first is that rights for women (as for other disadvantaged groups) issue of climate change draws attention to the power of human activity to transform the planet in its entirety, and it is brought into sharp focus by the predicament of low-lying islands like Tuvalu. As we have seen in this unit, the issue of rising sea level and other potential impacts of changing global climate also point to the transformations in the physical world that occur even without human influence. Oceanic islands provide a particularly cogent reminder that the living things wit"}

{"text": "MATH.IN ACTION:ALG.,GRAPH.,+TRIG... (2nd Edition 2004)\n\nby CONSORTIUM\n\nAnnotated Instructor Edition\n\nDescription\n\nThis intermediate algebra text, based on standards in the AMATYC Crossroads document, motivates college math students to develop mathematical literacy and a solid foundation for future study in mathematics and other disciplines. This third book of a three-book series presents mathematical concepts and skills through relevant activities derived from real-life situations. These activities are meaningful to students because they illustrate how mathematics arises naturally from real-world situations and problems. The Mathematics in Action series is based on the assumption that students learn mathematics best by doing mathematics in a meaningful context. Therefore, the text takes a collaborative approach to learning. Students take an active role in their own learning by working in groups, thereby developing communication skills, a sense of independence, and a \"can-do\" attitude about mathematics. Technology is integrated throughout the book so that students learn to interpret real-life data numerically, symbolically, and graphically. Regardless of their level of preparation for the course, students can use this text to increase their knowledge of mathematics, their problem-solving skills, and their overall confidence in their ability to learn."}

{"text": "Analytical Problem Solving: A Prototype for Curriculum Restructuring\n\nFor six years, Daniel Maki (Mathematics) and Wayne Winston (Business) of IU-Bloomington have been team-teaching a successful, practical, tool-oriented course, entitled Analytical Problem Solving. The majority of the students who take this course are liberal arts\nmajors (English, foreign languages, history, social sciences, etc.) in the Liberal Arts in Management Program (LAMP) who wish to learn how\nmathematics is used in business. The course is based on the idea that most students will appreciate mathematics more if they see an immediate use for it. With this in mind, the entire course is built around group projects. In addition, it has the following distinctive features which students find especially appealing:\n\nReal problems, obtained from businesses and governmental units, are used to motivate the mathematical topics covered. The course is project-driven with topics covered matching the knowledge needed to complete the projects;\n\nAll mathematical topics taught in the course are then used immediately in the projects; thus, the students see the usefulness of mathematics in solving a diverse set of real-life problems;\n\nStudents work in teams using technology to implement the\nmathematical tools developed in the class for the projects;\n\nStudents are required to document, explain, and defend their\nmathematical work, thereby honing their communications skills and providing them with a sense of closure and accomplishment.\n\nAn example of a project is the scheduling of tellers at a local credit union. Students began by collecting data on service times. Then they used hourly and daily customer data to develop a model\nthat could be used to forecast the workload at the credit union at any time. Next queuing theory was used to determine, as a function of the forecasted workload and service rate, the number of tellers needed at any given time. Then a user-friendly spreadsheet was developed that could be used by the credit union personnel manager to determine her manpower needs at any time. Finally a linear programming model was developed to help determine the minimum cost of scheduling tellers to meet forecasted manpower needs. This single project required the students to utilize basic statistics, regression analysis, queuing theory, advanced spreadsheet techniques, and linear programming.\n\nThe project-oriented structure of Analytical Problem Solving also suggests that it can be transplanted easily and naturally if well-documented teaching modules are developed. Indeed, a library of such teaching modules, built up and shared by members of ICUE-Math, would provide a\nrich source of materials with which any instructor could construct a similar course to suit the special needs and background of his or her students.\n\nAs we proceed with interdisciplinary course development and curriculum restructuring, we will draw on the experience and lessons learned from Analytical Problem Solving during the past six years. It is clearly not always possible, nor is it desirable, to make every course totally project-oriented. Nevertheless, the steering\ncommittees of the project will make every effort to ensure that the\nbasic idea which makes Analytical Problem Solving so successful-i.e., most students will appreciate mathematics more if they see an immediate use for it-will be used as guidepost in our course\ndevelopment effort."}

{"text": "umerical analysis is a subject of extreme interest to mathematicians and computer scientists, who will welcome this first inexpensive paperback edition of a groundbreaking classic text on the subject. In an introductory chapter on numerical methods and their relevance to computing, well-known mathematician Richard Hamming (\"the Hamming code,\" \"the Hamming distance,\" and \"Hamming window,\" etc.), suggests that the purpose of computing is insight, not merely numbers. In that connection he outlines five main ideas that aim at producing meaningful numbers that will be read and used, but will also lead to greater understanding of how the choice of a particular formula or algorithm influences not only the computing but our understanding of the results obtained. The five main ideas involve (1) insuring that in computing there is an intimate connection between the source of the problem and the usability of the answers (2) avoiding isolated formulas and algorithms in favor of a systematic study of alternate ways of doing the problem (3) avoidance of roundoff (4) overcoming the problem of truncation error (5) insuring the stability of a feedback system. In this second edition, Professor Hamming (Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California) extensively rearranged, rewrote and enlarged the material. Moreover, this book is unique in its emphasis on the frequency approach and its use in the solution of problems. Contents include: I. Fundamentals and Algorithms II. Polynomial Approximation- Classical Theory Ill. Fourier Approximation- Modern Theory IV. Exponential Approximation ... and more Highly regarded by experts in the field, this is a book with unlimited applications for undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics, science and engineering.

Moreover, there are very few books on these topics and they are not recent.\"\n\n–Numerical Algorithms (review of the first edition)\n\nThis unique book provides concepts and background necessary to understand and build algorithms for computing the elementary functions—sine, cosine, tangent, exponentials, and logarithms. The author presents and structures the algorithms, hardware-oriented as well as software-oriented, and also discusses issues related to accurate floating-point implementation. The purpose is not to give \"cookbook recipes\" that allow one to implement a given function, but rather to provide the reader with tools necessary to build or adapt algorithms for their specific computing environment.\n\nThis expanded second edition contains a number of revisions and additions, which incorporate numerous new results obtained during the last few years. New algorithms invented since 1997—such as Matula's bipartite method, another table-based method due to Ercegovac, Lang, Tisserand, and Muller—as well as new chapters on multiple-precision arithmetic and examples of implementation have been added. In addition, the section on correct rounding of elementary functions has been fully reworked, also in the context of new results. Finally, the introductory presentation of floating-point arithmetic has been expanded, with more emphasis given to the use of the fused multiply-accumulate instruction.\n\nThe book is an up-to-date presentation of information needed to understand and accurately use mathematical functions and algorithms in computational work and design. Graduate and advanced undergraduate students, professionals, and researchers in scientific computing, numerical analysis, software engineering, and computer engineering will find the book a useful reference and resource.\n\nTable of contents\n\nList of figures.- List of tables.- Preface to the second edition.- Preface to the first edition.- Introduction.- Some basic things about computer arithmetic.- Part I.
