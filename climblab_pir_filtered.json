The modules provide an opportunity to\nintroduce your liberal arts students to some modern (and traditional) topics in\nmathematics, and you will have more fun too!\n\nChoose four to six modules as a complete course, or choose one or two\nmodules to supplement another text.\n\nModules are moderately priced and your students save money because they buy\nexactly what they need.\n\nFor more information, please call Innovative Textbooks at\n949-854-5667 (9AM-5PM Pacific Time).\nReturn to the Home Page\n\nThere are currently 13 Modules in Mathematics, all authored by\nSteven Roman. The titles are listed below, followed by a brief description of\neach, with tables of contents. Click on a title to see the description, or\nsimply use the navigation keys to browse the entire list.\n\nThird Edition, 93 pages, ISBN 1-878015-20-6\n\nAn elementary discussion of how mathematics may be used in the social\nsciences. Requires only basic arithmetic skills. Chapter 1 contains a discussion\nof how to form a group ranking of products, based on a set of individual\nrankings. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the famous Arrow\nImpossibility Theorem. Chapter 2 is devoted to measuring an individual's power,\nor influence, in a group setting. For instance, how much more power does a\npermanent member of the U.N. security council have than a temporary member?\nChapter 3 contains a discussion of various methods for apportioning seats in the\nU.S. House of Representatives—a very important contemporary political\nproblem. The final section gives a fascinating historical perspective on this\n200 year old problem.\n\nThird Edition, 68 pages, ISBN 1-878015-21-4\n\nA survey of the contemporary topic of codes and coding. Prerequisites are\nminimal, since all of the necessary mathematics is developed in the module.\nChapter 1 contains a discussion of the ubiquitous check digit codes that are\nused for error detection, and can be found in a wide variety of common\ncircumstances, such as Universal Product Codes (Bar Codes), credit card numbers,\nbank check numbers, driver's licence numbers and ISBN's. We compare various\ncommonly used methods and show which ones work best for detecting errors.\nChapter 2 contains a discussion of the most famous code of all — the\nHamming code for error correction. The final chapter discusses the Huffman\ncoding scheme, which is used to encode data for space saving purposes (rather\nthan for error detection or correction).\n\nThird Edition, 54 pages, ISBN 1-878015-19-2\n\nThis module requires no special mathematical background. Its aim is to\nacquaint the student with the basics of symbolic logic, such as how to correctly\nuse DeMorgan's Laws, what the difference is between a conditional statement and\nits converse and how to recognize when an argument is logically valid. The\nmodule concludes with a brief discussion of how logic can be used to design\ncircuits.\n\nSecond Edition, 66 pages, ISBN 1-878015-23-0\n\nPrerequisites are intermediate algebra. The goals of this module are to\nintroduce the basic terminology related to interest, loans, leases and bonds;\nto show how various quantities, such as the monthly payments on a loan, can be\ncomputed using mathematical formulas; and to show how business calculators are\ndesigned to make these computations easier. Examples are done using a\nscientific calculator, the TI BA II Plus and the HP 10B. This module would make\na nice supplement to a course in business calculus.\n\nThird Edition, 42 pages, ISBN 1-878015-16-8\n\nAn introduction to the fascinating field of secret messages, requiring no\nformal mathematical prerequisites for the first chapter, and an acquaintance\nwith exponents for the second chapter. Chapter 1 describes some traditional, pre\nWorld War 2 methods for encoding messages. In Chapter 2, the author discusses\none of the most used contemporary methods for encoding — the RSA method. At\npresent, this method is believed to be secure, but may prove otherwise if\nefficient methods for factoring large numbers are ever discovered!\n\nFourth Edition, 49 pages, ISBN 1-878015-22-2\n\nThis module shows how exponents and logarithms play a role in the processes\nof growth and decay. Prerequisites are intermediate algebra. After a short\nreview of logarithms, there follows a discussion of compound interest. The next\nsection is devoted to the time value of money, including how to compute the\npayments on an auto loan or home mortgage. Then comes a discussion of famous\nlogarithmic scales, such as the Richter scale. The final section concerns the\nexponential growth of organisms and the decay of radioactive substances.\n\nSecond Edition, 52 pages, ISBN 1-878015-26-5\n\nEach chapter of this module is independent of the others, and contains a\ndifferent topic in mathematics. The only prerequisite is intermediate algebra.\nThis module would make a nice supplement to a precalculus course.\n\n126 pages, ISBN 1-878015-10-9\n\nThe first two chapters of a standard college algebra book, this module is\ndesigned for self-study and as a supplement to a calculus course for those\nstudents who need a little review or reference in algebra.",

By the end of the course unit the student will have learned more about familiar mathematical objects such as polynomials and algebraic numbers, will have acquired various computational and algebraic skills and will have seen how the introduction of structural ideas leads to the solution of mathematical problems.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nThe central theme of this course is factorisation (theory and practice) in commutative rings; rings of polynomials are our main examples but there are others, such as rings of algebraic integers.\n\nPolynomials are familiar objects which play a part in virtually every branch of mathematics. Historically, the study of solutions of polynomial equations (algebraic geometry and number theory) and the study of symmetries of polynomials (invariant theory) were a major source of inspiration for the vast expansion of algebra in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn this course the algebra of polynomials in n variables over a field of coefficients is the basic object of study. The course covers fairly recent advances which have important applications to computer algebra and computational algebraic geometry (Gröbner bases - an extension of the Euclidean division algorithm to polynomials in 2 or more variables), together with a selection of more classical material.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this course unit students will be able to demonstrate\n\nfacility in dealing with polynomials (in one and more variables);\n\nunderstanding of some basic ideal structure of polynomial rings;\n\nappreciation of the subtleties of factorisation into prime and irreducible elements;\n\nability to compute generating sets and Gröbner bases for ideals in polynomial rings;\n\nability to relate polynomials to other algebraic structures (algebraic varieties and groups of symmetries);\n\nability to solve problems relating to the factorisation of polynomials,\nirreducible polynomials and extension fields.\n\nFuture topics requiring this course unit\n\nNone, though the material connects usefully with algebraic geometry and Galois theory.\n\nTextbooks\n\nThe first two books are useful general references on algebra though neither covers Gröbner bases (which is a relatively new topic). For Gröbner bases see the book by Cox, Little and O'Shea. The last book is a new textbook which combines Gröbner bases with more traditional material.\n\nTeaching and learning methods\n\nTwo lectures and one examples class each week. In addition students should expect to spend at least four hours each\nweek on private study for this course unit.\n\nCourse notes will be provided, as well as examples sheets and solutions. The notes will be\nconcise and will need to be supplemented by your own notes taken in lectures, particularly\nof worked examples.",

    "text": "Math Anxiety\n\nThroughout grade school and maybe even in high school, many students felt there was no reason to take math.\n\nThese students hated math and felt they were never going to use it. There is still the tendency to think that only those who go into technical fields need math. Math teaches us to think. Math helps us to organize or thoughts, analyze information, and better understand the world around us.\n\nThere are myths about math that we have accepted as true and these tend to hold us back when it comes to learning math.\n\nSome popular myths are:\n\nFemales aren't any good at math\n\nThe majority can't do well in math because only a few people really have mathematical minds. (We are happy to get a \"C\" in math whereas we won't accept a \"C\" in English or any other subject that we like. We expect to do poorly in math).\n\nSome hints for studying math:\n\nRead your text first, before you try any problems.\n\nWrite down the theorems and definitions, read them out loud, and then rewrite them into your own words.\n\nDo a lot of problems and practice tests.\n\nDon't cram for tests. Frequent practice and review is the key to learning math. If you cram, you will be unsure of yourself. Formulas will become confused and problems will look differently.\n\nDon't keep looking in the back of your debt at the answers a. You may have the right answer but may not have done the problem correctly. b. If you have the wrong answer, it could affect your confidence and concentration.\n\nWhen you aren't sure of a problem, ask for help, but never erase your work. Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.\n\nSet aside a certain time everyday to study math.\n\nGet extra help when you need it. Come to the PLC for tutoring; ask your teacher or a classmate for help. Remember, you need to understand math; that does not mean memorizing it.\n\nBegin at the right place. If you feel that you need a review, be sure to start with a math class that begins at your level.\n\nA common story instructors hear from math students is that the students can do the work or homework and in class but when it comes down to the test, the students freeze.\n\nThe number one problem of math test anxiety is negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is when you talk yourself deeper into anxiety. You think \"what if\" or \"I can't\". You worry about finishing the test on time. You tend to concentrate on how you are feeling, on how the anxiety is affecting you instead of on the test itself.\n\nSome hints to counteract math test anxiety:\n\nConfront your anxiety by admitting that you are worried about this test. Anxiety and fear react in the body in the same way, and admitting that you re anxious relieves some of the anxiety.\n\nUse positive self-talk. Keep telling yourself that you can do this math, that you know this stuff, and that you are prepared.\n\nControl your physical self. Take a brisk walk around the classroom buildings using positive self-talk while walking. Keep your heart rate and respiration steady by doing slow, five count deep breathing exercises. Loosen tight muscles on your neck by doing shoulder rolls forward and backward. Relax legs and arms by shake outs before you walk into the classroom.\n\nFocus your attention away from yourself and towards the problem.\n\nWhen taking practice tests or working on homework, keep a diary of the kinds of thoughts you are having while working out the problems. Relate these concerns to your tutor or teacher.\n\nWhile the above suggestions will be helpful for the physical and emotional self, the following suggestions may be beneficial for the academic self.\n\nSome hints to better test taking:\n\nWrite down formulas and other memorized information directly onto the test. This eliminates the risk of forgetting or altering the information incorrectly as you work the problems.\n\nPreview the test. Find a problem you are comfortable with and start there. It is not necessary to work in numerical order. Try instead to choose an order that helps you stay positive.\n\nStart with the easier problems. Also keep in mind the total point of the test and plan a strategy to get the most amount of points possible in the shortest amount of time.\n\nPass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive. If you find yourself becoming anxious, try some relaxation techniques to calm down physically and then focus back on the test.\n\nReview the problems you've skipped. Maybe other problems you have solved can give you a better insight to the work needed for this problem.\n\nShow some work for each problem, even if it's a guess. Partial credit is still good.\n\nAllow for some time to look back over your work. Make sure you have read the directions correctly and look for careless errors.\n\nUse all of the test time. Anxiety can induce a need to escape. Try to control the anxiety before this feeling takes over. Leaving a test early may mean a loss of points on your test as well as other negative feedback. Remember, always try to remain positive.\n\nRemember, the key to conquering math anxiety is practice, practice, practice. The more confident you become in your ability, the better you will do.",

    "text": "GOOD COURSES\n\nCONTENTS\n\nI. Undergraduate mathematics\n\nA discussion of what a good undergrad programme in\nmathematics should be about can be found here.\nThe book concerns mathematics in the American system, where applied\nmathematics was\nrarely taught in maths departments (at the time of writing). It also\ndiscusses the content often presented in four-year American liberal arts\ncolleges, and two-year community colleges, and criticises the specialist\nnature of the topics\nchosen. The courses offered to students of science and engineering by\ndepartments of mathematics are also panned, one point being that the\nprofessor doing this job knows no science or engineering at all.\n\nThe author, Morris Kline, talks of the research professor, who hates\nteaching undergraduates of any sort, and also mentions the wide use made\nof graduate student tutors, who have neither training nor\nexperience. Scarce mention is made of full, associate and assistant\nprofessors, who form (in my experience) the bulk of the academic staff in\nmost departments of mathematics in American universities, and who do a\nvery professional job in their teaching, as well as research and admin.\n\nSome of the criticism of present methodology is way off centre. For\nexample, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using\nover-simplified models. He argues that there is no point teaching the laws\nof falling bodies as if there were no air friction: tell that to a\nparachutist, he quips. In this he fails to capture the essence of\nscience: we must study models, and compare with experiment, so that we may\nshoot them down, and revise them. More, we can usually find a range of\napplicability of\nthe simple model, outside of which it is no longer a good one. But\nworse: he seems to be saying that only a fully developed, correct model\nshould be taught. This goes against the teaching of Picasso: a teacher\nshould mix a little bit of what we do not know with a lot of what we do\nknow. I taught physics at Virginia Tech., a course in which the technician\nhad prepared the \"Galileo Bench\". This was an inclined plane on an air\ncushion, in which Galileo's laws of falling bodies, s = s(0) + vt + 1/2 at2,\nwas true, to within the experimental error. Some of the students\nfound these laws hard to understand, even without friction. When they had achieved\nthat, we went on to the refinements coming from friction. To start with\nthe full theory, would place them in a similar position to Galileo... who\nhad to cope with Aristotle's dictum that a force was needed to keep a\nbody moving; when Galileo had abandoned this, he broke the 2000 year stalemate\nin science.\n\nMost of the points made about the limited syllabus of a maths degree do\nnot apply to the UK, where applied\nmathematics traditionally forms half of the degree in\nmathematics. However, with the possible replacement of A-levels with a\nbacc., our school programme might become more like the American one. We\nshould then think about whether the university course might also move in\nthat direction. Should we have four-year degree courses in mathematics, with\nthe first year devoted to maths, physics, chemistry and computing? These\ncould cover the four subjects to replace the omitted parts of A-level. The\nmathematics course\ncould cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and\nstatistics,\ncomplex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices.\nPhysics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one\ndimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction,\nsimple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave\nmotion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations,\nand electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell). Chemistry might contain\nthe Bohr atom, the Mendeleev table, the inorganic chemistry of\nacids and bases, salts and metals. Some physical chemistry such as the law\nof mass-action, and some organic chemistry, should be\nincluded. Lab work in physics and chemistry should be at the\nlevel now done in schools in the UK. Computing might introduce a useful\nlanguage such as Java, Maple or Mathematica, and should give a general\ncompetence in Windows.\n\nKline suggests that scholarship in mathematics would serve a purpose,\nto reduce the number of pointless and empty papers, by critical reviews.\nThis used to be the job of Mathematical Reviews, until it changed its\npolicy, and now bans controversy in the reviews. Kline suggests that a new\ndegree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not\nrequire\noriginal theorems, but would be readable and deep. We have something\nsimilar, in\nthe M. Phil., which however has not got the status of the Ph. D.\n\nIII.Abstract Algebra\n\nIV. Graph theory\n\nV. The Kentucky Archives on\nMathematics\n\nThe site of the University\nof Kentucky hosts a list of free material on mathematics, of which\nIII. above is just one. I found the course on partial\ndifferential equations very useful. The course\non Hilbert Space Methods for Partial Differential Equations, by\nR. E. Showalter, is very pleasant indeed. It is slightly informal in its\ndefinition\nof distributions, but this is all that is needed for partial\ndifferential equations at this level.\n\nVI.Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia is a free internet\nencyclopaedia, written by its viewers. There\nis quite a large set of mathematics pages, as well as pages on physics and\nother sciences, and all other subjects. Some pages are sketchy, and others\nare literally empty,\nawaiting the first volunteer. I found a mistake in Wightman's\nbiography: it said he was British. I was able to edit that page and\ncorrect it. The statement of the Navier-Stokes equations could not be\nright, as the terms do not all have the same physical dimension.\n\nThe site is worth a browse, and might become more reliable as time\npasses.",

    "text": "The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\nReadership\n\nUndergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n-- Robin Hartshorne, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n-- I. Martin Isaacs, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\"",

    "text": "Post navigation\n\nReading Math\n\nMy Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I don't want them reading math. Kids are never taught to \"read\" a math textbook. If they ever do approach a math textbook, they approach it like a history book. The read it linearly. They also read it passively. Their eyes glaze over. They read words, but they don't try to connect the words to the equations or pictures. They don't read with a pencil in their hands. They hope for some Divine Knowledge to descend upon them simply by having the book open and their eyes on it.\n\nThat doesn't work. We all know this. Reading math is an active thing.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nFor question A, some representative responses:\n\n\"I read what was assigned to me but did not read anything extra.\"\n\"I find that textbook reading is pretty boring, so I don't do it unless I have to.\"\n\"I did not because I had assumed I wouldn't learn things I needed. All I would do was look at examples.\"\n\"No, I find it difficult to understand math when reading it in paragraphs; it makes more sense to me with a teacher.\"\n\"I did not generally read my math textbooks. I did, however, always look over the example problems.\"\n\nSome responses for Question B:\n\n1. The writing can be confusing, wordy, and not thorough\n2. The book is BORING\n3. Small print\n4. Too many words for math\n5. Outdated examples\n\nSome responses for Question C\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nPost navigation\n\n3 thoughts on \"Reading Math\"\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.",

As concentration camps do not provide books, paper, pen or pencils nearly all of his calculations had to be performed mentally. This forced Trachtenberg to develop methods and shortcuts for performing calculations mentally. Trachtenberg developed his discoveries into a complete system of mathematics.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Trachtenberg started teaching his system of mathematics. He started teaching the more backward children to prove that anyone could learn his system. In 1950 he founded the Mathematical Institute in Zurich, where both children and adults were taught the system.\n\nThe system has been thoroughly tested in Switzerland and is found to produce an increase in self confidence and general aptitude to study, as the students prove to themselves what they are capable of, by their accomplishments in calculating results to computations.\n\nThe Trachtenberg system is based on a series of keys which must be memorized. There is no need for multiplication tables or division as the system only relies on the ability to count. The system also places an emphasis on getting the right answer and provides a number of methods for checking the answers achieved by the system.\n\nResearch on the system, indicates that the system shortens time for mathematical computations by twenty percent and produces correct results, ninety nine percent of the time, due to the checking method used as part of the system.",

Bootstrap has been integrated into math and technology classrooms across the country, reaching thousands of students since 2006.\n\nProgramming. Not just writing code.\n\nKnowing how to write code is good, but it doesn't make you a programmer.\n\nSure, Bootstrap teaches students a programming language. But most\nimportantly, it teaches solid program design skills, such as\nstating input and types, writing test cases, and explaining code to others.\nBootstrap builds these elements into the curriculum in a gentle way\nthat helps students move from a word problem to finished code.\n\nAfter Bootstrap, these skills can be put to use in other programming environments, letting students take what they've learned into other programming classes.\n\nWatch the video to hear students, engineers, teachers, and the Bootstrap team describe what excites them about Bootstrap!\n\nReal, Standards-Based Math\n\nUnlike most programming classes, Bootstrap uses algebra as the vehicle for creating images and animations. That means that concepts students encounter in Bootstrap behave the exact same way that they do in math class. This lets students experiment with algebraic concepts by writing functions that make a rocket fly (linear equations), respond to keypresses (piecewise functions) or make it explode when it hits a meteor (distance formula). In fact, many word problems from standard math textbooks can be used as as programming assignments!\n\nThe entire curriculum is designed from the ground up to be aligned with Common Core standards for algebra. Bootstrap lessons cover mathematical topics that range from simple arithmetic expressions to the Pythagorean Theorem, Discrete Logic, Function Composition and the Distance Formula. The program is based on cognitive science research and best practices for improving critical thinking and problem solving.\n\n\"\"\n\n—\n\nOur team\n\nBootstrap is the creation of Emmanuel Schanzer, M.Ed. (in the hat). After earning a bachelors of Computer Science (Cornell University), he worked in the private sector for a number of years as a programmer (Microsoft, Vermonster, and others) until he switched careers and became a math teacher, starting out in Boston Public Schools. He is now a doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\n\nOur Supporters\n\nWe would like to thank the following, for their volunteer and financial support over the years: Apple, Cisco, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), Facebook, Google, as well as the Google Inc. Charitable Giving Fund of Tides Foundation, IBM, Jane Street Capital, LinkedIn, Microsoft, The National Science Foundation, NVIDIA, Thomson/Reuters, and the generous individuals who have given us private donations.\n\nIf you would like to support Bootstrap with a donation, send a check made out to Brown University to our PI, Shriram Krishnamurthi,\nat his mailing address.

    "text": "What to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nWhat to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nSo I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nDifferential Geometry\nmathematics of Fluid Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Field Theory\nmathematics of General Relativity\n\nIf you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,\n\nAs many courses in real analysis as possible\nAs many courses in statistics, probability.\na second course in numerical analysis.\na course in nonlinear optimization\na course in mathematical theory of finance.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory. So I think overall topology is a good idea if you wanna go for mathematical physics.",

I have used Saxon 1, 2, 3 and 5/4 now. Thus far, we have been very pleased with the curriculum. It allows me, the teacher to move a quickly or as slowly as the student needs. I am able to use the tests and assessments included in the student workbook to determine where to place the child and to even skip ahead if needed so that valuable time is not spent on things already mastered. The Teachers Manual is able to be reused with other students, but we always purchase a new workbook for each new student. The price of the workbooks are very reasonable.\n\nWe used four other math curricula in the course of 15 years of homeschooling. I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding. Saxon Math has helped me while I have been teaching. It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.\n\nWe just switched to Saxon month a few months ago. I have a daughter who really doesn't like math. I took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights. ;) ) She surprised me and picked Saxon. It is extremely black and white and not like the colorful books we have used before. She loves it so far and seems to be grasping the concepts. We didn't buy the manipulatives as I had a lot of them at home already (from other math programs we've used.) I can't really give this an excellent review as we are still new into it.\n\nThis curriculum was perfect for my sons needs at the moment.

    "text": "Introduction To Precalculus\n\nposted on: 20 Jun, 2012 | updated on: 21 Jun, 2012\n\nIn mathematical world, we study different topic, here we will see the pre Calculus introduction. Pre calculus is a topic which comes from the study of motion. It deals with different ideas, areas and volumes, rates of change, the orbits of planets, and infinite sequences.\nPre calculus consists of those subjects, skills, and insights which are necessary to recognize calculus. It involves arithmetic, algebra, coordinate Geometry, trigonometry, and, functions. In Pre calculus we study many different type of topics which includes, sets, real numbers, complex numbers, composite and polynomial Functions, trigonometry, limits, vectors, metrics, binomial theorem, and many other topics. Let's understand few basic topic of pre calculus.\nSet: - We know that Set is a collection of different type of objects which are defined in proper manner. Different types of operation are present in the set that are Union, intersection, complements and Cardinality product. Sets are of different type like Empty set, Universal set, etc.\nIf no element is available in the set then it is known as empty set, and the Sets are present in the universe of conversation are universal set.\nEmpty set is denoted by the symbol '∅' and universal set is denoted by 'U'\nReal number: - In the Real Numbers all the Rational and Irrational Numbers and whole numbers are present.\nFor example: Whole numbers are (1, 4, 6, 8, 10). Sometime the number 0 is also involved in Whole Number.\nRational number – The Rational Numbers are 3/5, 0.16, 0.33…2.2 etc.\nIrrational number – Irrational numbers are (⊼, √ 3) etc.\nIf we have √ -3, this number is not considered in the category of real number because it contains imaginary value and '∞' and it is not a real number.\nThis is a brief introduction to Precalculus in which we come across few Basic Terms of pre calculus.",

You\nare provided with a text book and a CD-Rom which displays the contents of the\nbook plus many exciting new interactive features which will assist teachers and\nstudents.\n\nThe book is language rich and technology rich. Whilst some of the exercises are\nsimply designed to build skills, every effort has been made to contextualise problems,\nso that students can see everyday uses and practical applications of the mathematics\nthey are studying.\n\nThe book contains many problems, from the basic to the advanced, to cater for\na wide range of student abilities and interests. Much emphasis has been placed\non the gradual development of concepts with appropriate worked examples. However,\nwe have also provided extension material for those who wish to go beyond Stage\n1 and look towards further studies or applications of mathematics for their career\nchoices. It is not our intention that each chapter be worked through in full.\nTime constraints will not allow for this. Consequently, teachers must select exercises\ncarefully, according to the abilities and prior knowledge of their students, in\norder to make the most efficient use of time and give as thorough coverage of\nwork as possible.\n\nThe extensive use of graphics calculators and computer packages throughout the\nbook enables students to realise the importance, application and appropriate use\nof technology. No single aspect of technology has been favoured. It is as important\nthat students work with a pen and paper as it is that they use their calculator\nor graphics calculator, or use a spreadsheet or graphing package on computer.\n\nThe interactive features of the CD-Rom allow immediate access to our own specially\ndesigned geometry packages, graphing packages and more. Teachers are provided\nwith a quick and easy method of demonstrating concepts, or students can discover\nfor themselves, and revisit when necessary.\n\nTeachers should note that instructions appropriate to each graphics calculator\nproblem are available on the CD-Rom and can be printed for students. These instructions\nare written for Sharp, Texas Instruments, Casio and Hewlett-Packard calculators.\n\nIn this changing world of mathematics education, we believe that the contextual\napproach shown in this book, with the associated use of technology, will enhance\nthe students' understanding, knowledge and appreciation of mathematics.",

    "text": "At Lawrence North High School, the entire hand-picked team of Algebra 1 instructors believes passionately that mastering these skills and concepts will have a stronger influence on your future success throughout high school and beyond than any other single course in which you may choose to enroll. Algebra 1 skills and conceptual relationships are the foundation of the CORE 40 graduation exam but will also prepare you for future math and science courses. We are committed as a team to providing quality instruction and appropriate materials and supporting you with plenty of attention, patience, and other resources. We understand the importance of the content of this class and we truly want you to succeed.\n\nSome of the \"big ideas\" we emphasize in Algebra 1 include properties of real numbers, solving equations and inequalities and proportions, functions and graphs, understanding lines and slope, polynomials and factoring, radicals and quadratic functions.\n\nOur measuring sticks are that darn CORE 40 test and your future success in Algebra 2, but our focus is on mastering those \"big ideas\" along the way. Some of these skills will be difficult for you to understand at first. I encourage you to keep these three P's in mind:\n\n1)Practice! Math is a skill and can only be mastered through routine,\n\nrigorous and disciplined practice.\n\n2)Pace! Don't try to rush or skip ahead until you fully understand what we have already done.\n\nTake breaks and ask lots of questions.\n\n3)Perspective! This class is imperative regardless of your goals. I encourage you to\n\ntake a step back from the mechanical steps of the arithmetic and try to understand\n\nthe concepts and relationships. When you understand why certain steps are required\n\nCongratulations! You made it to the second semester of Algebra 1. Only the students who have demonstrated a solid understanding of the concepts in the first semester are here right now. Yes, it's that important. The second semester is notable more difficult than the first, but we're confident you'll make it through or it would not have been recommended that you be here. We have two goals this semester: 1) to make sure everyone is prepared for the Algebra 1 End-of-Course Assessment (ECA) graduation exam in May, and 2) to help ensure your future success in Algebra 2.\n\nOur seventh unit explains the rules for exponents and multiplying and dividing factors with the same base. We'll follow that up with a unit on polynomials to get comfortable adding and subtracting like terms with exponents, then multiply polynomial groups together using the Distributive Property. In the next unit we will change directions and go backwards through the distributive process to factor polynomial expressions, especially quadratic trinomials. As the quarter draws to a close, we'll be breaking down and solving quadratic equations.",

    "text": "MATH32012 Commutative Algebra - 2012/13, Semester 2\n\nOnline Test\n\nThe Online Test is currently accessible via the MATH32012 course content page in Blackboard.\nYou may retake the test for revision purposes (e.g., to practise\nthe computation of Gröbner bases). It will not affect your coursework mark.\n(The coursework marks have been finalised and are available via the Grade\nCentre in Blackboard.)\n\nModule description and prerequisites\n\nYou should have general facility for dealing with algebraic structures: complex numbers, sets, groups, rings, fields. For this reason, MATH20212 Algebraic Structures 2 is a prerequisite.\n\nAbout the course\n\nMany find MATH32012 Commutative Algebra the most advanced abstract algebra course they take as part of their degree.\nNevertheless, the content of the course is not just a sequence of theorems and proofs.\nYou are expected to learn methods of algebraic computation relating to polynomials in several variables.\n\nSolving equations has been a driving force of algebra at least since the Babylonians learned to solve quadratic equations some 3700 years ago. The subject matter of this course is, however, informed by more recent developments.\n\nThe work of Hilbert in late 19th - 20th century was key to the modern treatment of multivariate polynomials and provided a basis for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. His result that every (consistent) system of polynomial equations over an algebraically closed field has at least one solution is known as the Nullstellensatz.\nBut an efficient method of finding such solutions by elimination was not found until 1965, when Buchberger invented Gröbner bases.\n\nIn the course, key theorems about the ring of polynomials in several variables will be rigorously proved.\nAlgorithms relating to polynomials will be explained and supported by examples. This includes factorising polynomials into irreducible factors and computing a Gröbner basis of an ideal.\n\nResults and methods of Commutative Algebra have applications in various branches of mathematics and computer science. Here are some puzzles which we may use in the course as an illustration for the main content. You are welcome to have a go at solving them!\n\nQuestion 1 (Fermat, 17th century).\nFind all integers a \"sandwiched\" between a square and a cube.\n\nQuestion 2.\nHow many ways are there of placing 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other? What about n queens on an n×n chessboard?\n\nQuestion 3.\nHow many distinct Sudoku boards are there? (A Sudoku board is a 9×9 square\nwith a number from 1 to 9 in each cell, satisfying the Sudoku constraints.)\n\nimages from Wikimedia commons\n\nCoursework\n\nThere will be 2 pieces of assessed coursework:\n\nAssessed homework 1 (see a link above): a take-home problem sheet\nset on Wednesday 27 February (week 5),\ndue on Tuesday 12 March (week 7) at 4pm.\n\nBlackboard-based online test: a timed, open-book test which the students complete online; multiple attempts are allowed\n\nPrevious years' exams\n\nCommutative algebra exam papers from years 2008-2012 are available here.",

This is an applied course in which students actively construct their own understanding of the methods, interpretation, communication, and application of statistics. Each unit is framed by enduring understandings and essential questions designed to allow students a deep understanding of the concepts at hand rather than memorization and emulation. Students will also complete several performance tasks throughout the year consisting of relevant, open-ended tasks requiring students to connect multiple statistical topics together. The TI-83+/84 OR 89 calculator and computers will be used to explore the world of data and the patterns which can be found by analyzing this information as well as statistical relationships.\n\nStandards Alignments\n\nAll SVL curriculum is aligned to Spokane Public School district curriculum, which is explicitly designed to support rigorous curriculum in order to stretch each learner to achieve at their highest ability through our district�s Written, Taught and Tested Initiative. Spokane�s curriculum engages students with higher order thinking questioning and assessments assist in determining how teachers can differentiate to meet student�s needs. Because SVL works with students individually, teachers assist each student to reach maximum learning by using SVL curriculum and other teacher developed resources to help each student reach standard.",

This method-along with foreshadowing-is used throughout the text to provide students with a comfortable base for learning something new from something old or familiar. With just a few connections to algebra, students have the tools to understand the circular functions, their domains and ranges, and the relationship between the circular functions and the functional values. The approach immediately launches the student into the concept of periodic functions, their applications, graphs, and use in modeling many periodic phenomena. Beginning with this approach provides the student with a common thread that can be used to discover, connect and understand the remaining concepts of trigonometry. [via]",

    "text": "Ok you people out there that want the easy way out in your geometry, algabra, and pre-calc class\ni got a math program for you that does most of what you need for these classes.\nne thing from: Area, surface area, volume, cramers rule, Conics, distance formula, end behavior, midpoint, pascals triangle, quadratic formula, reducing radicals, and slope.\nIt runs right out of the program menu, or if you really want to be secretive, it works under mirage (which can hide it from teachers)\nI was hoping to sell it for like 2 bucks....but don't know if it will work that way... but if you want it..email me and i'll give it to you for free\n\nBecause I like to help people learn programming and stuff, I have setup a few yahoo groups where people can learn from me/eachother, share files/programs, post messages, etc. - Trust me, I am among the best, so I think it would be very beneficial.\n\nI am very willing to teach people everything I know whenever I have free time (I like to work on a one-to-one basis). Check out my groups if you are at all interested or curious.\n\nBelow are the web addresses for my groups (CAREFUL, I had to put a space after each slash, so if you copy and paste, delete the spaces):\n\nYou could try searching for one first. For example, you could probably find one or more in 83plus/basic/math (such as baseic.zip or bases.zip) or in 83/basic/math.\n\nI don't want to sound rude or condescending, but you really should look first for what you want before you ask someone to do something for you. This site especially has most math programs a beginner like you or I would need.\n\nOnce you've learned enough and need a program that doesn't exist (at least on ticalc), one should hope that you would have the ability and knowledge to write what you need by yourself or at least to search the many resources available to you on the Internet and other places. This goes for most every beginner, not just you.\n\nI'm not trying to be high and mighty by calling you and others a beginner; I still consider myself to be a beginner in many ways.\n\nhi i am taking AP Calculus. please, i am begging you. someone has to create a super program for this class. it isn't a hard class, but it takes time to solve some stuff. also, a calculus program would save me time in contests. well see you and thanks\n\nA lot of programs calculate everything for you in the background, giving you a final answer. What about a program that gives you the formula? I can't remember formula, and I don't trust values of programs, I'd prefer to just see the formula.\n\nOption 1: If it is Mirage compatible (add a \":\" to the beginning of the first line), you simply highlight it in Mirage and press \"tan(\". To the right, the properties should read either \"LOCKED:Y\" or \"L:Y\".\nOption 2: Send it to your computer (PC or Mac) and open it with 83+ Graph Link. There should be a box next to \"Protected\". Check the box.\nIf you don't have either of those two programs, e-mail me at SSpyro64@AOL.com\n\nOk, this is kind of similar.\nI'm the only person at my school who knows any bit how to program calculators, so, like anyone would do, I sell them. However, lately, people have been giving each other the programs instead of buying them from me. Is there a way to stop people from being able to send programs????\n\nthats pretty underhanded... but, back to the point if you aren't sending then mirage its easy to send them a shell that can detect hidden progrsms and run them but not unhide them. You can send them the program from mirage so you dont have to unhide it. they will be able to run the program from the shell but if you dont give anyone mirage then they cant send them.",

    "text": "Intermediate Algebra, 1e, authored by Sherri Messersmith presents content in bite-size pieces, focusing not only on learning mathematical concepts, but also explaining the why behind those concepts. For students, learning mathematics is not just about the memorization of concepts and formulas, but it is also about the journey of learning how to problem solve. By breaking the sections down into manageable chunks, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle, and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward. Proven pedagogical features, such as You Try problems after each example, reinforce a student's mastery of a concept. While teaching in the classroom, Messersmith has created worksheets for each section that fall into three categories: review worksheets/basic skills, worksheets to teach new content, and worksheets to reinforce/pull together different concepts. These worksheets are a great way to both enhance instruction and to give the students more tools to be successful in studying a given topic. The author is also an extremely popular lecturer, and finds it important to be in the video series that accompany her texts. Finally, the author finds it important to not only provide quality, but also an abundant quantity of exercises and applications. The book is accompanied by numerous useful supplements, including McGraw-Hill's online homework management system, MathZone as well as ALEKS.\n\nMESSERSMITH is rigorous enough to prepare students for the next level yet easy to read and understand. The exposition is written as if a professor is teaching in a lecture to be more accessible to students. The language is mathematically sound yet easy enough for students to understand",

Through multisensory instruction, I integrate all of the senses to help create a mathematical picture of concepts and theories, forming the foundation of understanding.\n\nMathematics\n\nMath literacy means having the mechanics and skills to perform calculations without looking them up and knowing what situations these skills may be appropriate. The true \"math literate\" is not someone who can successfully complete a test on recently acquired processes and techniques, but one who can apply those abilities to situations that occur in a variety of situations in the long term.\n\nIn secondary and postsecondary math, there should be a broad focus encompassing a wide variety of career choices.

    "text": "Algebra Unplugged is unlike any math book you have ever read. It explains why algebra problems have to be solved in a particular way. Most textbooks give just a brief introduction to the next set of problems, and then students are expected to complete the practice sets. But how many times has the student (or parent!) not understood what exactly was being asked of them? Understanding the \"why\" is essential to some children.\n\nThe author uses funny, and sometimes odd, comparisons to try to help the student understand the concepts and vocabulary of algebra. I know the author is writing to teens, but some of his comparisons were a little \"out there\" for me. As the parent of a child with Asperger's who struggles with math, I was glad to have a chance to review this item. I was wondering if it would be able to help him understand algebra a bit better when the time comes in another year or two. I'm going to have to let him be the judge of that. Because he sees things very literally, I'm not sure that he'll understand some of the comparisons.\n\nWith more than 250 pages, this book covers any topic you can think of--negative numbers, working with fractions, solving difficult equations, graphing, and much more. If your child needs a little extra help understanding the basic facts of algebra, you may find it helpful to use Algebra Unplugged side-by-side with your chosen textbook. It's often very easy to just \"go through the motions\" with math and make good grades without understanding what is truly going on, but I don't think that is the best way to learn math. Algebra Unplugged is likely to fill in the gaps for many confused students... and probably some parents as well!\n\nProduct review by Kris Price, Assistant to the Publishers, The Old Schoolhouse Magazine, LLC, May 2007",

    "text": "You are here\n\nTips to help make Math Simple\n\nFrustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word \"Math\"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.\n\nRead the Book\n\nRead the assigned sections over carefully and look closely at the sample problems. Decide if you benefit more by reading before or after the instructor covers the material.\n\nDevelop a Sound Math Foundation\n\nBecause most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nTime Management\n\nComplete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nCalculator\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.\n\nShow Your Work\n\nAvoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.\n\nOrganise Your Work and\n\nWrite Legibly\n\nWrite all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.\n\nSpaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.\n\nBe sure to line up the terms in each step of the solution, and write steps one below the other rather than to the right or left. Use lined paper or graph paper to help organise the problems on your page. Don't scrunch! Use plenty of paper to work each problem. Recycle the paper at the end of the term if you are concerned about wasting paper.\n\nSupport Services and Materials\n\nFind out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!\n\nPreparation and Supplies\n\n• Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:\n\n• Complete any previously assigned homework assignments\n\n• Compile a list of questions about the previous assignments to ask the instructor",
