You Design the Textbook!\n\nA series of independent modules designed for the general college level\nstudent.\n\nPrerequisites are kept to a minimum. The modules provide an opportunity to\nintroduce your liberal arts students to some modern (and traditional) topics in\nmathematics, and you will have more fun too!\n\nChoose four to six modules as a complete course, or choose one or two\nmodules to supplement another text.\n\nModules are moderately priced and your students save money because they buy\nexactly what they need.\n\nFor more information, please call Innovative Textbooks at\n949-854-5667 (9AM-5PM Pacific Time).\nReturn to the Home Page\n\nThere are currently 13 Modules in Mathematics, all authored by\nSteven Roman. The titles are listed below, followed by a brief description of\neach, with tables of contents. Click on a title to see the description, or\nsimply use the navigation keys to browse the entire list.\n\nThird Edition, 93 pages, ISBN 1-878015-20-6\n\nAn elementary discussion of how mathematics may be used in the social\nsciences. Requires only basic arithmetic skills. Chapter 1 contains a discussion\nof how to form a group ranking of products, based on a set of individual\nrankings. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the famous Arrow\nImpossibility Theorem. Chapter 2 is devoted to measuring an individual's power,\nor influence, in a group setting. For instance, how much more power does a\npermanent member of the U.N. security council have than a temporary member?\nChapter 3 contains a discussion of various methods for apportioning seats in the\nU.S. House of Representatives—a very important contemporary political\nproblem. The final section gives a fascinating historical perspective on this\n200 year old problem.\n\nThird Edition, 68 pages, ISBN 1-878015-21-4\n\nA survey of the contemporary topic of codes and coding. Prerequisites are\nminimal, since all of the necessary mathematics is developed in the module.\nChapter 1 contains a discussion of the ubiquitous check digit codes that are\nused for error detection, and can be found in a wide variety of common\ncircumstances, such as Universal Product Codes (Bar Codes), credit card numbers,\nbank check numbers, driver's licence numbers and ISBN's. We compare various\ncommonly used methods and show which ones work best for detecting errors.\nChapter 2 contains a discussion of the most famous code of all — the\nHamming code for error correction. The final chapter discusses the Huffman\ncoding scheme, which is used to encode data for space saving purposes (rather\nthan for error detection or correction).\n\nThird Edition, 54 pages, ISBN 1-878015-19-2\n\nThis module requires no special mathematical background. Its aim is to\nacquaint the student with the basics of symbolic logic, such as how to correctly\nuse DeMorgan's Laws, what the difference is between a conditional statement and\nits converse and how to recognize when an argument is logically valid. The\nmodule concludes with a brief discussion of how logic can be used to design\ncircuits.\n\nSecond Edition, 66 pages, ISBN 1-878015-23-0\n\nPrerequisites are intermediate algebra. The goals of this module are to\nintroduce the basic terminology related to interest, loans, leases and bonds;\nto show how various quantities, such as the monthly payments on a loan, can be\ncomputed using mathematical formulas; and to show how business calculators are\ndesigned to make these computations easier. Examples are done using a\nscientific calculator, the TI BA II Plus and the HP 10B. This module would make\na nice supplement to a course in business calculus.\n\nThird Edition, 42 pages, ISBN 1-878015-16-8\n\nAn introduction to the fascinating field of secret messages, requiring no\nformal mathematical prerequisites for the first chapter, and an acquaintance\nwith exponents for the second chapter. Chapter 1 describes some traditional, pre\nWorld War 2 methods for encoding messages. In Chapter 2, the author discusses\none of the most used contemporary methods for encoding — the RSA method. At\npresent, this method is believed to be secure, but may prove otherwise if\nefficient methods for factoring large numbers are ever discovered!\n\nFourth Edition, 49 pages, ISBN 1-878015-22-2\n\nThis module shows how exponents and logarithms play a role in the processes\nof growth and decay. Prerequisites are intermediate algebra. After a short\nreview of logarithms, there follows a discussion of compound interest. The next\nsection is devoted to the time value of money, including how to compute the\npayments on an auto loan or home mortgage. Then comes a discussion of famous\nlogarithmic scales, such as the Richter scale. The final section concerns the\nexponential growth of organisms and the decay of radioactive substances.\n\nSecond Edition, 52 pages, ISBN 1-878015-26-5\n\nEach chapter of this module is independent of the others, and contains a\ndifferent topic in mathematics. The only prerequisite is intermediate algebra.\nThis module would make a nice supplement to a precalculus course.\n\n126 pages, ISBN 1-878015-10-9\n\nThe first two chapters of a standard college algebra book, this module is\ndesigned for self-study and as a supplement to a calculus course for those\nstudents who need a little review or reference in algebra.",

    "text": "Specification\n\nAims\n\nThe course unit will deepen and extend students' knowledge and understanding of commutative algebra. By the end of the course unit the student will have learned more about familiar mathematical objects such as polynomials and algebraic numbers, will have acquired various computational and algebraic skills and will have seen how the introduction of structural ideas leads to the solution of mathematical problems.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nThe central theme of this course is factorisation (theory and practice) in commutative rings; rings of polynomials are our main examples but there are others, such as rings of algebraic integers.\n\nPolynomials are familiar objects which play a part in virtually every branch of mathematics. Historically, the study of solutions of polynomial equations (algebraic geometry and number theory) and the study of symmetries of polynomials (invariant theory) were a major source of inspiration for the vast expansion of algebra in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn this course the algebra of polynomials in n variables over a field of coefficients is the basic object of study. The course covers fairly recent advances which have important applications to computer algebra and computational algebraic geometry (Gröbner bases - an extension of the Euclidean division algorithm to polynomials in 2 or more variables), together with a selection of more classical material.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this course unit students will be able to demonstrate\n\nfacility in dealing with polynomials (in one and more variables);\n\nunderstanding of some basic ideal structure of polynomial rings;\n\nappreciation of the subtleties of factorisation into prime and irreducible elements;\n\nability to compute generating sets and Gröbner bases for ideals in polynomial rings;\n\nability to relate polynomials to other algebraic structures (algebraic varieties and groups of symmetries);\n\nability to solve problems relating to the factorisation of polynomials,\nirreducible polynomials and extension fields.\n\nFuture topics requiring this course unit\n\nNone, though the material connects usefully with algebraic geometry and Galois theory.\n\nTextbooks\n\nThe first two books are useful general references on algebra though neither covers Gröbner bases (which is a relatively new topic). For Gröbner bases see the book by Cox, Little and O'Shea. The last book is a new textbook which combines Gröbner bases with more traditional material.\n\nTeaching and learning methods\n\nTwo lectures and one examples class each week. In addition students should expect to spend at least four hours each\nweek on private study for this course unit.\n\nCourse notes will be provided, as well as examples sheets and solutions. The notes will be\nconcise and will need to be supplemented by your own notes taken in lectures, particularly\nof worked examples.",

    "text": "Math Anxiety\n\nThroughout grade school and maybe even in high school, many students felt there was no reason to take math.\n\nThese students hated math and felt they were never going to use it. There is still the tendency to think that only those who go into technical fields need math. Math teaches us to think. Math helps us to organize or thoughts, analyze information, and better understand the world around us.\n\nThere are myths about math that we have accepted as true and these tend to hold us back when it comes to learning math.\n\nSome popular myths are:\n\nFemales aren't any good at math\n\nThe majority can't do well in math because only a few people really have mathematical minds. (We are happy to get a \"C\" in math whereas we won't accept a \"C\" in English or any other subject that we like. We expect to do poorly in math).\n\nSome hints for studying math:\n\nRead your text first, before you try any problems.\n\nWrite down the theorems and definitions, read them out loud, and then rewrite them into your own words.\n\nDo a lot of problems and practice tests.\n\nDon't cram for tests. Frequent practice and review is the key to learning math. If you cram, you will be unsure of yourself. Formulas will become confused and problems will look differently.\n\nDon't keep looking in the back of your debt at the answers a. You may have the right answer but may not have done the problem correctly. b. If you have the wrong answer, it could affect your confidence and concentration.\n\nWhen you aren't sure of a problem, ask for help, but never erase your work. Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.\n\nSet aside a certain time everyday to study math.\n\nGet extra help when you need it. Come to the PLC for tutoring; ask your teacher or a classmate for help. Remember, you need to understand math; that does not mean memorizing it.\n\nBegin at the right place. If you feel that you need a review, be sure to start with a math class that begins at your level.\n\nA common story instructors hear from math students is that the students can do the work or homework and in class but when it comes down to the test, the students freeze.\n\nThe number one problem of math test anxiety is negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is when you talk yourself deeper into anxiety. You think \"what if\" or \"I can't\". You worry about finishing the test on time. You tend to concentrate on how you are feeling, on how the anxiety is affecting you instead of on the test itself.\n\nSome hints to counteract math test anxiety:\n\nConfront your anxiety by admitting that you are worried about this test. Anxiety and fear react in the body in the same way, and admitting that you re anxious relieves some of the anxiety.\n\nUse positive self-talk. Keep telling yourself that you can do this math, that you know this stuff, and that you are prepared.\n\nControl your physical self. Take a brisk walk around the classroom buildings using positive self-talk while walking. Keep your heart rate and respiration steady by doing slow, five count deep breathing exercises. Loosen tight muscles on your neck by doing shoulder rolls forward and backward. Relax legs and arms by shake outs before you walk into the classroom.\n\nFocus your attention away from yourself and towards the problem.\n\nWhen taking practice tests or working on homework, keep a diary of the kinds of thoughts you are having while working out the problems. Relate these concerns to your tutor or teacher.\n\nWhile the above suggestions will be helpful for the physical and emotional self, the following suggestions may be beneficial for the academic self.\n\nSome hints to better test taking:\n\nWrite down formulas and other memorized information directly onto the test. This eliminates the risk of forgetting or altering the information incorrectly as you work the problems.\n\nPreview the test. Find a problem you are comfortable with and start there. It is not necessary to work in numerical order. Try instead to choose an order that helps you stay positive.\n\nStart with the easier problems. Also keep in mind the total point of the test and plan a strategy to get the most amount of points possible in the shortest amount of time.\n\nPass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive. If you find yourself becoming anxious, try some relaxation techniques to calm down physically and then focus back on the test.\n\nReview the problems you've skipped. Maybe other problems you have solved can give you a better insight to the work needed for this problem.\n\nShow some work for each problem, even if it's a guess. Partial credit is still good.\n\nAllow for some time to look back over your work. Make sure you have read the directions correctly and look for careless errors.\n\nUse all of the test time. Anxiety can induce a need to escape. Try to control the anxiety before this feeling takes over. Leaving a test early may mean a loss of points on your test as well as other negative feedback. Remember, always try to remain positive.\n\nRemember, the key to conquering math anxiety is practice, practice, practice. The more confident you become in your ability, the better you will do.",

    "text": "GOOD COURSES\n\nCONTENTS\n\nI. Undergraduate mathematics\n\nA discussion of what a good undergrad programme in\nmathematics should be about can be found here.\nThe book concerns mathematics in the American system, where applied\nmathematics was\nrarely taught in maths departments (at the time of writing). It also\ndiscusses the content often presented in four-year American liberal arts\ncolleges, and two-year community colleges, and criticises the specialist\nnature of the topics\nchosen. The courses offered to students of science and engineering by\ndepartments of mathematics are also panned, one point being that the\nprofessor doing this job knows no science or engineering at all.\n\nThe author, Morris Kline, talks of the research professor, who hates\nteaching undergraduates of any sort, and also mentions the wide use made\nof graduate student tutors, who have neither training nor\nexperience. Scarce mention is made of full, associate and assistant\nprofessors, who form (in my experience) the bulk of the academic staff in\nmost departments of mathematics in American universities, and who do a\nvery professional job in their teaching, as well as research and admin.\n\nSome of the criticism of present methodology is way off centre. For\nexample, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using\nover-simplified models. He argues that there is no point teaching the laws\nof falling bodies as if there were no air friction: tell that to a\nparachutist, he quips. In this he fails to capture the essence of\nscience: we must study models, and compare with experiment, so that we may\nshoot them down, and revise them. More, we can usually find a range of\napplicability of\nthe simple model, outside of which it is no longer a good one. But\nworse: he seems to be saying that only a fully developed, correct model\nshould be taught. This goes against the teaching of Picasso: a teacher\nshould mix a little bit of what we do not know with a lot of what we do\nknow. I taught physics at Virginia Tech., a course in which the technician\nhad prepared the \"Galileo Bench\". This was an inclined plane on an air\ncushion, in which Galileo's laws of falling bodies, s = s(0) + vt + 1/2 at2,\nwas true, to within the experimental error. Some of the students\nfound these laws hard to understand, even without friction. When they had achieved\nthat, we went on to the refinements coming from friction. To start with\nthe full theory, would place them in a similar position to Galileo... who\nhad to cope with Aristotle's dictum that a force was needed to keep a\nbody moving; when Galileo had abandoned this, he broke the 2000 year stalemate\nin science.\n\nMost of the points made about the limited syllabus of a maths degree do\nnot apply to the UK, where applied\nmathematics traditionally forms half of the degree in\nmathematics. However, with the possible replacement of A-levels with a\nbacc., our school programme might become more like the American one. We\nshould then think about whether the university course might also move in\nthat direction. Should we have four-year degree courses in mathematics, with\nthe first year devoted to maths, physics, chemistry and computing? These\ncould cover the four subjects to replace the omitted parts of A-level. The\nmathematics course\ncould cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and\nstatistics,\ncomplex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices.\nPhysics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one\ndimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction,\nsimple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave\nmotion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations,\nand electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell). Chemistry might contain\nthe Bohr atom, the Mendeleev table, the inorganic chemistry of\nacids and bases, salts and metals. Some physical chemistry such as the law\nof mass-action, and some organic chemistry, should be\nincluded. Lab work in physics and chemistry should be at the\nlevel now done in schools in the UK. Computing might introduce a useful\nlanguage such as Java, Maple or Mathematica, and should give a general\ncompetence in Windows.\n\nKline suggests that scholarship in mathematics would serve a purpose,\nto reduce the number of pointless and empty papers, by critical reviews.\nThis used to be the job of Mathematical Reviews, until it changed its\npolicy, and now bans controversy in the reviews. Kline suggests that a new\ndegree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not\nrequire\noriginal theorems, but would be readable and deep. We have something\nsimilar, in\nthe M. Phil., which however has not got the status of the Ph. D.\n\nIII.Abstract Algebra\n\nIV. Graph theory\n\nV. The Kentucky Archives on\nMathematics\n\nThe site of the University\nof Kentucky hosts a list of free material on mathematics, of which\nIII. above is just one. I found the course on partial\ndifferential equations very useful. The course\non Hilbert Space Methods for Partial Differential Equations, by\nR. E. Showalter, is very pleasant indeed. It is slightly informal in its\ndefinition\nof distributions, but this is all that is needed for partial\ndifferential equations at this level.\n\nVI.Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia is a free internet\nencyclopaedia, written by its viewers. There\nis quite a large set of mathematics pages, as well as pages on physics and\nother sciences, and all other subjects. Some pages are sketchy, and others\nare literally empty,\nawaiting the first volunteer. I found a mistake in Wightman's\nbiography: it said he was British. I was able to edit that page and\ncorrect it. The statement of the Navier-Stokes equations could not be\nright, as the terms do not all have the same physical dimension.\n\nThe site is worth a browse, and might become more reliable as time\npasses.",

    "text": "The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\nReadership\n\nUndergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n-- Robin Hartshorne, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n-- I. Martin Isaacs, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\"",

    "text": "Discovering Geometry Intro\n\nDiscovering Geometry began in my classroom over 35 years ago. During my first ten years of teaching I did not use a textbook, but created my own daily lesson plans and classroom management system. I believe students learn with greater depth of understanding when they are actively engaged in the process of discovering concepts and we should delay the introduction of proof in geometry until students are ready. Until Discovering Geometry, no textbook followed that philosophy.\n\nI was also involved in a Research In Industry grant where I repeatedly heard that the skills valued in all working environments were the ability to express ideas verbally and in writing, and the ability to work as part of a team. I wanted my students to be engaged daily in doing mathematics and exchanging ideas in small cooperative groups.\n\nThe fourth edition of Discovering Geometry includes new hands-on techniques, curriculum research, and technologies that enhance my vision of the ideal geometry class. I send my heartfelt appreciation to the many teachers who contributed their feedback during classroom use. Their students and future students will help continue the evolution of Discovering Geometry.",

    "text": "Post navigation\n\nReading Math\n\nMy Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I don't want them reading math. Kids are never taught to \"read\" a math textbook. If they ever do approach a math textbook, they approach it like a history book. The read it linearly. They also read it passively. Their eyes glaze over. They read words, but they don't try to connect the words to the equations or pictures. They don't read with a pencil in their hands. They hope for some Divine Knowledge to descend upon them simply by having the book open and their eyes on it.\n\nThat doesn't work. We all know this. Reading math is an active thing.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nFor question A, some representative responses:\n\n\"I read what was assigned to me but did not read anything extra.\"\n\"I find that textbook reading is pretty boring, so I don't do it unless I have to.\"\n\"I did not because I had assumed I wouldn't learn things I needed. All I would do was look at examples.\"\n\"No, I find it difficult to understand math when reading it in paragraphs; it makes more sense to me with a teacher.\"\n\"I did not generally read my math textbooks. I did, however, always look over the example problems.\"\n\nSome responses for Question B:\n\n1. The writing can be confusing, wordy, and not thorough\n2. The book is BORING\n3. Small print\n4. Too many words for math\n5. Outdated examples\n\nSome responses for Question C\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nPost navigation\n\n3 thoughts on \"Reading Math\"\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.",

As concentration camps do not provide books, paper, pen or pencils nearly all of his calculations had to be performed mentally. This forced Trachtenberg to develop methods and shortcuts for performing calculations mentally. Trachtenberg developed his discoveries into a complete system of mathematics.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Trachtenberg started teaching his system of mathematics. He started teaching the more backward children to prove that anyone could learn his system. In 1950 he founded the Mathematical Institute in Zurich, where both children and adults were taught the system.\n\nThe system has been thoroughly tested in Switzerland and is found to produce an increase in self confidence and general aptitude to study, as the students prove to themselves what they are capable of, by their accomplishments in calculating results to computations.\n\nThe Trachtenberg system is based on a series of keys which must be memorized. There is no need for multiplication tables or division as the system only relies on the ability to count. The system also places an emphasis on getting the right answer and provides a number of methods for checking the answers achieved by the system.\n\nResearch on the system, indicates that the system shortens time for mathematical computations by twenty percent and produces correct results, ninety nine percent of the time, due to the checking method used as part of the system.",

This lets students experiment with algebraic concepts by writing functions that make a rocket fly (linear equations), respond to keypresses (piecewise functions) or make it explode when it hits a meteor (distance formula). In fact, many word problems from standard math textbooks can be used as as programming assignments!\n\nThe entire curriculum is designed from the ground up to be aligned with Common Core standards for algebra. Bootstrap lessons cover mathematical topics that range from simple arithmetic expressions to the Pythagorean Theorem, Discrete Logic, Function Composition and the Distance Formula. The program is based on cognitive science research and best practices for improving critical thinking and problem solving.\n\n\"\"\n\n—\n\nOur team\n\nBootstrap is the creation of Emmanuel Schanzer, M.Ed. (in the hat). After earning a bachelors of Computer Science (Cornell University), he worked in the private sector for a number of years as a programmer (Microsoft, Vermonster, and others) until he switched careers and became a math teacher, starting out in Boston Public Schools. He is now a doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\n\nOur Supporters\n\nWe would like to thank the following, for their volunteer and financial support over the years: Apple, Cisco, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), Facebook, Google, as well as the Google Inc.

    "text": "What to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nWhat to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nSo I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nDifferential Geometry\nmathematics of Fluid Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Field Theory\nmathematics of General Relativity\n\nIf you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,\n\nAs many courses in real analysis as possible\nAs many courses in statistics, probability.\na second course in numerical analysis.\na course in nonlinear optimization\na course in mathematical theory of finance.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory. So I think overall topology is a good idea if you wanna go for mathematical physics.",

I have used Saxon 1, 2, 3 and 5/4 now. Thus far, we have been very pleased with the curriculum. It allows me, the teacher to move a quickly or as slowly as the student needs. I am able to use the tests and assessments included in the student workbook to determine where to place the child and to even skip ahead if needed so that valuable time is not spent on things already mastered. The Teachers Manual is able to be reused with other students, but we always purchase a new workbook for each new student. The price of the workbooks are very reasonable.\n\nWe used four other math curricula in the course of 15 years of homeschooling. I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding. Saxon Math has helped me while I have been teaching. It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.\n\nWe just switched to Saxon month a few months ago. I have a daughter who really doesn't like math. I took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights. ;) ) She surprised me and picked Saxon. It is extremely black and white and not like the colorful books we have used before. She loves it so far and seems to be grasping the concepts. We didn't buy the manipulatives as I had a lot of them at home already (from other math programs we've used.) I can't really give this an excellent review as we are still new into it.\n\nThis curriculum was perfect for my sons needs at the moment. He did go through the years worth of work very quickly, but he has a real thirst for math. My son wanted a few math games added to suppliment his text work. It is a good curriculum.",

Pre calculus is a topic which comes from the study of motion. It deals with different ideas, areas and volumes, rates of change, the orbits of planets, and infinite sequences.\nPre calculus consists of those subjects, skills, and insights which are necessary to recognize calculus. It involves arithmetic, algebra, coordinate Geometry, trigonometry, and, functions. In Pre calculus we study many different type of topics which includes, sets, real numbers, complex numbers, composite and polynomial Functions, trigonometry, limits, vectors, metrics, binomial theorem, and many other topics. Let's understand few basic topic of pre calculus.\nSet: - We know that Set is a collection of different type of objects which are defined in proper manner. Different types of operation are present in the set that are Union, intersection, complements and Cardinality product. Sets are of different type like Empty set, Universal set, etc.\nIf no element is available in the set then it is known as empty set, and the Sets are present in the universe of conversation are universal set.\nEmpty set is denoted by the symbol '∅' and universal set is denoted by 'U'\nReal number: - In the Real Numbers all the Rational and Irrational Numbers and whole numbers are present.\nFor example: Whole numbers are (1, 4, 6, 8, 10). Sometime the number 0 is also involved in Whole Number.\nRational number – The Rational Numbers are 3/5, 0.16, 0.33…2.2 etc.\nIrrational number – Irrational numbers are (⊼, √ 3) etc.\nIf we have √ -3, this number is not considered in the category of real number because it contains imaginary value and '∞' and it is not a real number.\nThis is a brief introduction to Precalculus in which we come across few Basic Terms of pre calculus.",

Whilst some of the exercises are\nsimply designed to build skills, every effort has been made to contextualise problems,\nso that students can see everyday uses and practical applications of the mathematics\nthey are studying.\n\nThe book contains many problems, from the basic to the advanced, to cater for\na wide range of student abilities and interests. Much emphasis has been placed\non the gradual development of concepts with appropriate worked examples. However,\nwe have also provided extension material for those who wish to go beyond Stage\n1 and look towards further studies or applications of mathematics for their career\nchoices. It is not our intention that each chapter be worked through in full.\nTime constraints will not allow for this. Consequently, teachers must select exercises\ncarefully, according to the abilities and prior knowledge of their students, in\norder to make the most efficient use of time and give as thorough coverage of\nwork as possible.\n\nThe extensive use of graphics calculators and computer packages throughout the\nbook enables students to realise the importance, application and appropriate use\nof technology. No single aspect of technology has been favoured. It is as important\nthat students work with a pen and paper as it is that they use their calculator\nor graphics calculator, or use a spreadsheet or graphing package on computer.\n\nThe interactive features of the CD-Rom allow immediate access to our own specially\ndesigned geometry packages, graphing packages and more. Teachers are provided\nwith a quick and easy method of demonstrating concepts, or students can discover\nfor themselves, and revisit when necessary.\n\nTeachers should note that instructions appropriate to each graphics calculator\nproblem are available on the CD-Rom and can be printed for students. These instructions\nare written for Sharp, Texas Instruments, Casio and Hewlett-Packard calculators.\n\nIn this changing world of mathematics education, we believe that the contextual\napproach shown in this book, with the associated use of technology, will enhance\nthe students' understanding, knowledge and appreciation of mathematics.",

    "text": "At Lawrence North High School, the entire hand-picked team of Algebra 1 instructors believes passionately that mastering these skills and concepts will have a stronger influence on your future success throughout high school and beyond than any other single course in which you may choose to enroll. Algebra 1 skills and conceptual relationships are the foundation of the CORE 40 graduation exam but will also prepare you for future math and science courses. We are committed as a team to providing quality instruction and appropriate materials and supporting you with plenty of attention, patience, and other resources. We understand the importance of the content of this class and we truly want you to succeed.\n\nSome of the \"big ideas\" we emphasize in Algebra 1 include properties of real numbers, solving equations and inequalities and proportions, functions and graphs, understanding lines and slope, polynomials and factoring, radicals and quadratic functions.\n\nOur measuring sticks are that darn CORE 40 test and your future success in Algebra 2, but our focus is on mastering those \"big ideas\" along the way. Some of these skills will be difficult for you to understand at first. I encourage you to keep these three P's in mind:\n\n1)Practice! Math is a skill and can only be mastered through routine,\n\nrigorous and disciplined practice.\n\n2)Pace! Don't try to rush or skip ahead until you fully understand what we have already done.\n\nTake breaks and ask lots of questions.\n\n3)Perspective! This class is imperative regardless of your goals. I encourage you to\n\ntake a step back from the mechanical steps of the arithmetic and try to understand\n\nthe concepts and relationships. When you understand why certain steps are required\n\nCongratulations! You made it to the second semester of Algebra 1. Only the students who have demonstrated a solid understanding of the concepts in the first semester are here right now. Yes, it's that important. The second semester is notable more difficult than the first, but we're confident you'll make it through or it would not have been recommended that you be here. We have two goals this semester: 1) to make sure everyone is prepared for the Algebra 1 End-of-Course Assessment (ECA) graduation exam in May, and 2) to help ensure your future success in Algebra 2.\n\nOur seventh unit explains the rules for exponents and multiplying and dividing factors with the same base. We'll follow that up with a unit on polynomials to get comfortable adding and subtracting like terms with exponents, then multiply polynomial groups together using the Distributive Property. In the next unit we will change directions and go backwards through the distributive process to factor polynomial expressions, especially quadratic trinomials. As the quarter draws to a close, we'll be breaking down and solving quadratic equations.",

The workshops cover topics that are not commonly taught in school math classes. Through an intuitive approach to each subject, students are exposed to both interesting and active areas of contemporary mathematics research.\n\nA secondary purpose of the high school workshops is to expose high school students to what an undergraduate education in mathematics includes, and to encourage them to add math classes to their schedule when they enter college.\n\nIf you are a teacher interested in bringing your class to a workshop, please contact the current program coordinator (see below).\n\nWorkshop topics\n\nListed here are past workshop topics.

The program came into existence in Spring 1997 as one aspect of the SWRIMS project, when SWRIMS director Dr. William Vélez suggested this outreach program—and allocated SWRIMS funding—to graduate students Jennifer Christian-Smith, Aaron Ekstrom, and Alexander Perlis. (SWRIMS had already been involved in high school workshops on Population Biology and Honey Bees, which were organized by Dr. Joseph Watkins.)\n\nInitially, graduate student program coordinators and workshop organizers were funded by SWRIMS. Since around 2000, the primary incentive for graduate student participation has been the vertical integration requirement for graduate students funded by the department's VIGRE Grant.\n\nReports\n\nTalks about (aspects of) this outreach program\n\nKatrina Piatek-Jimenez and Jennifer Christian-Smith.

It will not affect your coursework mark.\n(The coursework marks have been finalised and are available via the Grade\nCentre in Blackboard.)\n\nModule description and prerequisites\n\nYou should have general facility for dealing with algebraic structures: complex numbers, sets, groups, rings, fields. For this reason, MATH20212 Algebraic Structures 2 is a prerequisite.\n\nAbout the course\n\nMany find MATH32012 Commutative Algebra the most advanced abstract algebra course they take as part of their degree.\nNevertheless, the content of the course is not just a sequence of theorems and proofs.\nYou are expected to learn methods of algebraic computation relating to polynomials in several variables.\n\nSolving equations has been a driving force of algebra at least since the Babylonians learned to solve quadratic equations some 3700 years ago. The subject matter of this course is, however, informed by more recent developments.\n\nThe work of Hilbert in late 19th - 20th century was key to the modern treatment of multivariate polynomials and provided a basis for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. His result that every (consistent) system of polynomial equations over an algebraically closed field has at least one solution is known as the Nullstellensatz.\nBut an efficient method of finding such solutions by elimination was not found until 1965, when Buchberger invented Gröbner bases.\n\nIn the course, key theorems about the ring of polynomials in several variables will be rigorously proved.\nAlgorithms relating to polynomials will be explained and supported by examples. This includes factorising polynomials into irreducible factors and computing a Gröbner basis of an ideal.\n\nResults and methods of Commutative Algebra have applications in various branches of mathematics and computer science. Here are some puzzles which we may use in the course as an illustration for the main content. You are welcome to have a go at solving them!\n\nQuestion 1 (Fermat, 17th century).\nFind all integers a \"sandwiched\" between a square and a cube.\n\nQuestion 2.\nHow many ways are there of placing 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other? What about n queens on an n×n chessboard?\n\nQuestion 3.\nHow many distinct Sudoku boards are there? (A Sudoku board is a 9×9 square\nwith a number from 1 to 9 in each cell, satisfying the Sudoku constraints.)\n\nimages from Wikimedia commons\n\nCoursework\n\nThere will be 2 pieces of assessed coursework:\n\nAssessed homework 1 (see a link above): a take-home problem sheet\nset on Wednesday 27 February (week 5),\ndue on Tuesday 12 March (week 7) at 4pm.\n\nBlackboard-based online test: a timed, open-book test which the students complete online; multiple attempts are allowed\n\nPrevious years' exams\n\nCommutative algebra exam papers from years 2008-2012 are available here.",

This is an applied course in which students actively construct their own understanding of the methods, interpretation, communication, and application of statistics. Each unit is framed by enduring understandings and essential questions designed to allow students a deep understanding of the concepts at hand rather than memorization and emulation. Students will also complete several performance tasks throughout the year consisting of relevant, open-ended tasks requiring students to connect multiple statistical topics together. The TI-83+/84 OR 89 calculator and computers will be used to explore the world of data and the patterns which can be found by analyzing this information as well as statistical relationships.\n\nStandards Alignments\n\nAll SVL curriculum is aligned to Spokane Public School district curriculum, which is explicitly designed to support rigorous curriculum in order to stretch each learner to achieve at their highest ability through our district�s Written, Taught and Tested Initiative. Spokane�s curriculum engages students with higher order thinking questioning and assessments assist in determining how teachers can differentiate to meet student�s needs. Because SVL works with students individually, teachers assist each student to reach maximum learning by using SVL curriculum and other teacher developed resources to help each student reach standard.",

The course is cross-listed as both a biology and biomedical engineering class.\n\n\"I've previously taken regular calculus classes with engineers and wondered what would the classes ever be useful for,\" said Kate Coyle, a biology major who completed the Dynamics class and graduated this semester. \"Labs I've had in biology and physics show you the protocol and the expected result.\n\n\"This is not the same, at all. We were solving real problems every day.\"\n\nStudents work through problems using an online interactive textbook, Dynamics of Biological Systems: A Modeling Manual Chiel wrote and the computer programming language Mathematica, which scientists worldwide rely on to build mathematical models of complex systems. Chiel's book is available free to students as well as teachers who may want to use it as is or as a model for their own classes.\n\nWhen teams become stuck on a problem,,Chiel or a teaching assistant makes suggestions, gives clues and tries to coax out the answer. After success, teachers quiz individuals about how they found the solution and what they'd learned.\n\nThe class of 30 is spread out among hexagonal tables. Teams power up their laptops and go to work. Each day the teachers rotate to a different group of students, and after each class they compare notes on who has mastered the skills and who needs extra help, Gill said.\n\nWhen the second half of the semester begins, teams choose a mathematical model that was recently published in a scientific journal, begin reconstructing and analyzing it and then writing in detail what they learn. The students then extend the model to answer new questions that they ask themselves, and write up results as if they were writing for a scientific journal.\n\nCoyle and her teammates Valencia Williams and Joshua DeRivera focused on a pa",

    "text": "Book summary\n\nThe text presents a circular function approach to trigonometry by demonstrating connections between the familiar algebra and the new language of trigonometry. This method-along with foreshadowing-is used throughout the text to provide students with a comfortable base for learning something new from something old or familiar. With just a few connections to algebra, students have the tools to understand the circular functions, their domains and ranges, and the relationship between the circular functions and the functional values. The approach immediately launches the student into the concept of periodic functions, their applications, graphs, and use in modeling many periodic phenomena. Beginning with this approach provides the student with a common thread that can be used to discover, connect and understand the remaining concepts of trigonometry. [via]",

Check out my groups if you are at all interested or curious.\n\nBelow are the web addresses for my groups (CAREFUL, I had to put a space after each slash, so if you copy and paste, delete the spaces):\n\nYou could try searching for one first. For example, you could probably find one or more in 83plus/basic/math (such as baseic.zip or bases.zip) or in 83/basic/math.\n\nI don't want to sound rude or condescending, but you really should look first for what you want before you ask someone to do something for you. This site especially has most math programs a beginner like you or I would need.\n\nOnce you've learned enough and need a program that doesn't exist (at least on ticalc), one should hope that you would have the ability and knowledge to write what you need by yourself or at least to search the many resources available to you on the Internet and other places. This goes for most every beginner, not just you.\n\nI'm not trying to be high and mighty by calling you and others a beginner; I still consider myself to be a beginner in many ways.\n\nhi i am taking AP Calculus. please, i am begging you. someone has to create a super program for this class. it isn't a hard class, but it takes time to solve some stuff. also, a calculus program would save me time in contests. well see you and thanks\n\nA lot of programs calculate everything for you in the background, giving you a final answer. What about a program that gives you the formula? I can't remember formula, and I don't trust values of programs, I'd prefer to just see the formula.\n\nOption 1: If it is Mirage compatible (add a \":\" to the beginning of the first line), you simply highlight it in Mirage and press \"tan(\". To the right, the properties should read either \"LOCKED:Y\" or \"L:Y\".\nOption 2: Send it to your computer (PC or Mac) and open it with 83+ Graph Link. There should be a box next to \"Protected\". Check the box.\nIf you don't have either of those two programs, e-mail me at SSpyro64@AOL.com\n\nOk, this is kind of similar.\nI'm the only person at my school who knows any bit how to program calculators, so, like anyone would do, I sell them. However, lately, people have been giving each other the programs instead of buying them from me. Is there a way to stop people from being able to send programs????\n\nthats pretty underhanded... but, back to the point if you aren't sending then mirage its easy to send them a shell that can detect hidden progrsms and run them but not unhide them. You can send them the program from mirage so you dont have to unhide it. they will be able to run the program from the shell but if you dont give anyone mirage then they cant send them.",

    "text": "Intermediate Algebra, 1e, authored by Sherri Messersmith presents content in bite-size pieces, focusing not only on learning mathematical concepts, but also explaining the why behind those concepts. For students, learning mathematics is not just about the memorization of concepts and formulas, but it is also about the journey of learning how to problem solve. By breaking the sections down into manageable chunks, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle, and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward. Proven pedagogical features, such as You Try problems after each example, reinforce a student's mastery of a concept. While teaching in the classroom, Messersmith has created worksheets for each section that fall into three categories: review worksheets/basic skills, worksheets to teach new content, and worksheets to reinforce/pull together different concepts. These worksheets are a great way to both enhance instruction and to give the students more tools to be successful in studying a given topic. The author is also an extremely popular lecturer, and finds it important to be in the video series that accompany her texts. Finally, the author finds it important to not only provide quality, but also an abundant quantity of exercises and applications. The book is accompanied by numerous useful supplements, including McGraw-Hill's online homework management system, MathZone as well as ALEKS.\n\nMESSERSMITH is rigorous enough to prepare students for the next level yet easy to read and understand. The exposition is written as if a professor is teaching in a lecture to be more accessible to students. The language is mathematically sound yet easy enough for students to understand",

    "text": "Edie M. Brown / Academic Therapist\n\nPeople often say that mathematics is a universal language. It is the essence of cognition - thinking with numbers, imagery, and language. For the people who understand mathematics, the language of numbers turns into imagery, letting them calculate and verify mathematics while seeing its logic. Through multisensory instruction, I integrate all of the senses to help create a mathematical picture of concepts and theories, forming the foundation of understanding.\n\nMathematics\n\nMath literacy means having the mechanics and skills to perform calculations without looking them up and knowing what situations these skills may be appropriate. The true \"math literate\" is not someone who can successfully complete a test on recently acquired processes and techniques, but one who can apply those abilities to situations that occur in a variety of situations in the long term.\n\nIn secondary and postsecondary math, there should be a broad focus encompassing a wide variety of career choices. This includes common foundations of math ideas and applications. Students should be adept at the integration of mathematical concepts. These areas include algebra, geometry, probability, statistics, calculus, and discrete mathematics.",

    "text": "Algebra Unplugged is unlike any math book you have ever read. It explains why algebra problems have to be solved in a particular way. Most textbooks give just a brief introduction to the next set of problems, and then students are expected to complete the practice sets. But how many times has the student (or parent!) not understood what exactly was being asked of them? Understanding the \"why\" is essential to some children.\n\nThe author uses funny, and sometimes odd, comparisons to try to help the student understand the concepts and vocabulary of algebra. I know the author is writing to teens, but some of his comparisons were a little \"out there\" for me. As the parent of a child with Asperger's who struggles with math, I was glad to have a chance to review this item. I was wondering if it would be able to help him understand algebra a bit better when the time comes in another year or two. I'm going to have to let him be the judge of that. Because he sees things very literally, I'm not sure that he'll understand some of the comparisons.\n\nWith more than 250 pages, this book covers any topic you can think of--negative numbers, working with fractions, solving difficult equations, graphing, and much more. If your child needs a little extra help understanding the basic facts of algebra, you may find it helpful to use Algebra Unplugged side-by-side with your chosen textbook. It's often very easy to just \"go through the motions\" with math and make good grades without understanding what is truly going on, but I don't think that is the best way to learn math. Algebra Unplugged is likely to fill in the gaps for many confused students... and probably some parents as well!\n\nProduct review by Kris Price, Assistant to the Publishers, The Old Schoolhouse Magazine, LLC, May 2007",

    "text": "You are here\n\nTips to help make Math Simple\n\nFrustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word \"Math\"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.\n\nRead the Book\n\nRead the assigned sections over carefully and look closely at the sample problems. Decide if you benefit more by reading before or after the instructor covers the material.\n\nDevelop a Sound Math Foundation\n\nBecause most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nTime Management\n\nComplete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nCalculator\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.\n\nShow Your Work\n\nAvoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.\n\nOrganise Your Work and\n\nWrite Legibly\n\nWrite all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.\n\nSpaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.\n\nBe sure to line up the terms in each step of the solution, and write steps one below the other rather than to the right or left. Use lined paper or graph paper to help organise the problems on your page. Don't scrunch! Use plenty of paper to work each problem. Recycle the paper at the end of the term if you are concerned about wasting paper.\n\nSupport Services and Materials\n\nFind out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!\n\nPreparation and Supplies\n\n• Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:\n\n• Complete any previously assigned homework assignments\n\n• Compile a list of questions about the previous assignments to ask the instructor",

Introduced about 1870 by the pioneers of combinatorics who were then still known as geometers, graphs have recently been recognized as the most adaptable tools for certain organizational problems. After first being used in operations research, graphs have now been introduced into information theory where they have proved to ba of use in many different areas....\n\nThis book stresses the connection between, and the applications of, design theory to graphs and codes. Beginning with a brief introduction to design theory and the necessary background, the book also provides relevant topics for discussion from the theory of graphs and codes....Algorithmic Graph Theory and Perfect Graphs, first published in 1980, has become the classic introduction to the field. This new Annals edition continues to convey the message that intersection graph models are a necessary and important tool for solving real-world problems. It remains a stepping stone from which the reader may embark on one of many fascinating research trails.\n\nAs graph theory continues its explosive growth, conjectures are proved and new theorems formed. The techniques involved, which have applications in a broad spectrum of mathematics, ranging from analysis to operations research, have become more sophisticated if not more manageable. This new edition, therefore, includes new theorems (e.g. the Perfect Graph Theorem, due to Lovasz) as well as new proofs of classical results. A number of sections have been significantly revised....\n\nGraphs and Matrices provides a welcome addition to the rapidly expanding selection of literature in this field. As the title suggests, the book's primary focus is graph theory, with an emphasis on topics relating to linear algebra and matrix theory. Information is presented at a relatively elementary level with the view of leading the student into further research. In the first part of the book matrix preliminaries are discussed and the basic properties of graph-associated matrices highlighted.The Graphs and Models series by Bittinger, Beecher, Ellenbogen, and Penna is known for helping students \"see the math\" through its focus on visualization and technology. These books continue to maintain the features that have helped students succeed for years: focus on functions, visual emphasis, side-by-side algebraic and graphical solutions, and real-data applications.\n\nThis book is concerned with the relations between graphs, error-correcting codes and designs, in particular how techniques of graph theory and coding theory can give information about designs. A major revision and expansion of a previous volume in this series, this *** includes many examples and new results as well as improved treatments of older material. So that non-specialists will find the treatment accessible the authors have included short introductions to the three main topics. This book will be welcomed by graduate students and research mathematicians and be valuable for advanced courses in finite combinatorics....",

Math. Debrecen \"This is an unusual book, being more a book about mathematics than a mathematics book. It includes mathematical issues, but also questions from the philosophy of mathematics, the psychology of mathematical discovery, the history of mathematics, and biographies of mathematicians, in short, a book about the mathematical experience broadly considered… The book found its way into \"Much for liberal arts students\" courses and into education courses directed at future teachers. Term paper topics, essay assignments, problems, computer applications, and suggested readings are included. This new material should greatly enhance the usefulness of this very creative book. The range of topics covered is immense and the contents cannot easily be summarized. The book makes excellent casual reading, would make a good textbook, or could easily be used as a supplement to nearly any course concerned with mathematics.\" -Zentralblatt Math \"This is a people-centered book about mathematics, and as such it provides an opportunity to explore fundamental issues that are typically absent from the experience of most college and university students (as well as their teachers). This new edition provides an excellent initiation of students into some of the more challenging aspects of mathematics…The study edition of The Mathematical Experience will help its readers acquire a real understanding of mathematics.\" -Notices of the AMS \"Two distinguished mathematicians...have written a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor...\" --The New Yorker (1984 American Book Award Edition)\n\nBack in the early 90's when I was an almost-penniless mathematics student I was standing in front of a bookshelf in my local bookstore and had to choose between this and Gödel, Escher, Bach. I chose this book and I still don't regret it. [I have also subsequently bought GEB :-)] Driven by their obvious love of the subject, the authors do a credible job of tackling just what it is about mathematics that makes mathematicians love it so much, often to the bafflement of the rest of the world. A particular personal favourite is the series of four conversations between an \"ideal mathematician\" and, respectively, a University Public Information Officer, a philosophy student, a positive philosopher and a sceptical classicist. I would recommend this book to students of mathematics at any level beyond the elementary, especially those with an interest in the foundations of their subject. The authors do however acknowledge that some parts of the book will seem alien to the layman.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who enjoys Horizon and other science programs but wishes they were less stripped of technicalities and more in depth: if you are very curious about physics and mathematics, you may find this a very stimulating read. After all you don't need to be a good comedian to enjoy watching comedy, so with little mathematical knowledge you can enjoy this very wide ranging discussion of many exotic fields of maths and gain a sense of the range and significance and methodologies of this field at the outer limits of human abstract thought. This very readable, demanding, though provoking book that can occupy you for weeks and sustain several re-readings.\n\nAround my early to mid teens, finding the mathematics I was being taught easy but also puzzling I started to have philosophical questions that were just not properly addressed. I later hoped (naively I now know) my Science/Engineering degree would answer those questions. It didn't. I had wanted to dig deeper into what mathematics is but instead was taught increasingly obscure and complex \"results\" that were useful to my discipline. Had I known it at the time this book would have answered my questions (often answering them with more questions, true). It appears to give an excellent framework to the consideration of any uneasiness you might feel with mathematics especially if you find/found school levels maths easy.\n\nIf after reading this you still feel uneasy then you know you need to proceed further into philosophy.",

    "text": "The skills that students are practicing in related rates problems are:\n\nDifferentiating a known equation implicitly with respect to time.\n\nInterpreting the time derivative of a quantity as a rate of change.\n\nThe main reason that related rates problems feel so contrived is that calculus books do not want to assume that the students are familiar with any of the equations of science or economics. Every related rates problem inherently involves differentiating a known equation, and the only equations that the calculus book assumes are the equations of geometry.\n\nThus, you can find related rates problems involving various area and volume formulas, related rates problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem or similar triangles, related rates problems involving triangle trigonometry, and so forth. A few of these problems are compelling -- for example, computing the speed of an airplane based on ground observations of its altitude and apparent angular velocity -- but most of them do feel a bit contrived.\n\nThe reality, of course, is that students are familiar with many of the basic equations and concepts of science and economics, and there's no rule against using these in problems. For example, you can make up all sorts of compelling related rates problems by starting with any physics or chemistry equation and imagining a situation where you might want to take its derivative:\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the object is accelerating at a rate of $9.8 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$, how fast is the kinetic energy increasing when the speed is $30 \\;\\text{m}/\\text{s}$?\n\nAn ideal gas satisfies $PV = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R \\approx 8.314\\;\\; \\text{J}\\; \\text{mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$. Give the rate at which the temperature and volume of the gas are increasing, and then ask about the rate of change in pressure when the volume and temperature reach certain amounts.\n\nThe total energy stored in a capacitor is $\\frac{1}{2} Q^2 / C$, where $Q$ is the amount of charge stored in the capacitor and $C$ is the capacitance. Give the value of $C$ and the rate at which $Q$ is decreasing, and ask about the rate at which the capacitor is losing energy when the energy is a certain amount.\n\nIn astronomy, the absolute magnitude $M$ of a star is related to its luminosity $L$ by the formula\n$$\nM \\;=\\; M_{\\text{sun}} -\\; 2.5\\; \\log_{10}(L/L_{\\text{sun}}).\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\text{sun}} = 4.75$ and $L_{\\text{sun}} = 3.839 \\times 10^{26} \\text{watts}$. (Note that, by convention, brighter stars have lower magnitude.) If the absolute magnitude of a variable star is decreasing at a rate of $0.09 / \\text{week}$, how quickly is the luminosity of the star increasing when the magnitude is $3.8$?\n\nIt's easy to make these up: just think of any equation in science or economics whose derivative might be interesting. Wikipedia and/or science textbooks can be helpful for finding equations from a wide variety of fields.",

With the help of this book, I was completely prepared for everything the professor threw at us and more.\n\nSome of the problems are simple and should help to reinforce the basic concepts learned from another book. Learn the fundamentals from some other book (or even a professor), and refine your thought processes using this one. There are some basic explanations of concepts and problem types, but most of the space is devoted to problems and solutions, as you may have guessed. If I had trouble with a problem from another book, I could almost always find a similar one in the REA book.

    "text": "Editorial Reviews\n\nAs far as math goes, McKellar knows her stuff. With two girlcentric, best-selling titles under her belt (Math Doesn't Suck, 2008, and Kiss My Math, 2009) and a degree in mathematics from UCLA, it is almost easy to forget that she was Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years. Facing down a 432-page book devoted to algebra could give even math whizzes pause, but McKellar makes it work, taking the textbook-meets-Seventeen approach by mixing the explanations and equations with boy talk, quizzes, and testimonials from successful women. While a tutor might use this title as a teaching aid, teen girls will want to explore it on their own. Navigation is easy; students are encouraged to hop from chapter to chapter as their homework demands. The breakdown of equations is effective and certainly unconventional—explaining functions in terms of sausage factories, for example, or exponents in terms of whip-bearing female executives (makes sense in the book, promise)—and while McKellar keeps her focus on how to solve math problems, her approach is both readable and even entertaining. --Courtney Jones\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBestMore About the Author\n\nBest known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from UCLA, went on to co-write a published math theorem, and continues to be an outspoken role model for young women to excel in math.\n\nMcKellar's 3rd and latest math book encourages teenage girls to outclass the boys in algebra. This can be an especially tough subject and she tackles it in a way that invites the outlandish idea of actually enjoying math.\n\nShe rejects the notion that excelling in algebra is all about natural gift. Rather, it's about determination and making an effort.\n\nWhile the sex-appeal of the book might be in question, ultimately this is a book broken down into straightforward language, easy charts and memorable reminders of the process of algebra.\n\nAdditionally, you'll find motivating stories from youthful female adults who've struggled with math, but learned to conquer their struggles. Danica proclaims. \"I'm here to tell you that giving up on ourselves because of our own stereotypes and limited imaginations is a far more destructive force than any challenge or obstacle 'out there,'\"\n\nOne bonus in the book is the inclusion of good tables and charts. These can be worth the price of the book alone. These succinctly explain the meaning of math terms such as fractions, coefficients and variables.\n\nA surprising aspect of the book is the authors inclusion of advice on how to choose the right guys to date. While she doesn't provide a mathematic formula for this it does seem she dispenses some basic common sense.\n\nWhat a great book to help tutor teen girls in math! It is organized well, so it is easy to navigate and you don't have to read it straight through. You can pick your topic and go back and forth with ease. The author is obviously a great teacher and knows her stuff. She combines that with her ability to reach out and grab the attention of teen girls and make math fun. A must have to share with the girls in your life!\n\nAt last, a book that teaches middle-school students and their parents in simple terms how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square and to solve the quadratic equation in standard form in X (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) to come up with the quadratic forumla. Most colleges and high schools do not teach this -- they just expect the student to know it.\n\nThe charter school I support plans to use Hot X: Algebra Exposed in concert with the first two books to ensure most or all Grade 8 students attain an A (93 or higher) in Algebra I.\n\nDanica McKellar needs to continue writing math books. Since these are such outstanding books, few state departments of education will adopt them for use, which means parents, other major care givers, and supportive businesses will have to come up with the funds to help schools with the purchase of these books. Not only should the schools have these books for use as textbooks, but individual students should have their own copy to help learn the material initially and to refresh key points as they complete Algebra II and beyond.\n\nDanica also has web sites that provide additional information for each book. Check out [...]. If you wish to provide input to Danica, you may send it to her at: share@danicamckellar.com.",

    "text": "So I was having a lot of medical issues my freshman year, and I pulled a C+ in second quarter calculus and a C- in third quarter calculus (integration and multivariable calculus, respectively.) I still have one more quarter of calculus entitled \"Vector analysis.\" I'm wondering if my poor performance (and poor understanding of the material) is going to negatively affect me later on. Will I have a chance to relearn some of the material in my other classes, or should I self study to get myself up to par? Just so you know, as of right now I'm leaning towards a Mechanical Engineering major, but I may switch into Civil (though highly unlikely.) This upcoming quarter I'm taking Vector Analysis, first quarter Calculus-based Physics, and a MATLAB course (I have absolutely zero programming experience.) Physics and MATLAB both require integral calculus as a prerequisite. I need a B in physics to switch into MechE. Should I be self studying the calculus that I don't quite understand?\n\nAlso, will these grades kill my chances of getting into grad school? They're my only grades below a B, and I hopefully won't have many (any?) more C's in my college career.\n\nTo understand the computational part of engineering you need to understand differential equations, which is where you use the calculus skills. You then use DEs to describe all kinds of physical phenomena. So, the basic calculus skills are very important to understanding engineering.\n\nThanks HPuck. So would it suffice to get down integration and partial derivatives and their applications? Or should I learn other things like Taylor Polynomials and Convergence/Divergence (the stuff that tripped me up most)?\n\nCalculus is one of the few subjects you really need to put in the effort to learn well. Study all of it until you have a strong conceptual understanding of it. Bad grades are bad grades, but calculus is important.\n\nCalculus will be used in physics. Multivariable calculus will become important when you take the physics course with electricity and magnetism. Differential equations will become important in many places.\n\nTry and improve on basic integration/misc techniques (integration by parts, partial fraction decomp, trig int, partial derivations, etc) because these will be very important in DE. A lot of questions will have a lot of nested integrals/nasty integrals and you don't want to get stuck in the middle of the question. Freshen up on Taylor and Maclaurin series. When you take linear alg practice matrix techniques, translation matrices, etc. (will be used in systems of differential equations)There are only two subjects you absolutely have to know, without constantly consulting a reference: calculus and physics.\nYeah, it will come back to haunt you if you don't put in the effort to get the hang of it. Get on that, no matter how much work it takes.1 year left of Engineering school. Taylor series rarely comes into play. The only time it did show up, it was just mentioned as part of the proof and we didn't have to do anything with it. But yes, calculus is EXTREMELY important, if not for the pure concept of what it means to take the integral/derivative. Also, so so many people don't have a good grasp on all the material that came before calculus too, especially trig. Know your trig, it will help you out, a lot.",

    "text": "Specification\n\nAims\n\nThe unit aims to introduce the basic ideas of differentiable manifolds.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nDifferentiable manifolds are among the most fundamental notions of modern mathematics. Roughly, they are geometrical objects\nthat can be endowed with coordinates; using these coordinates one can apply differential and integral calculus, but the results\nare coordinate-independent.\n\nExamples of manifolds start with open domains in Euclidean space R^n, and include \"multidimensional surfaces\"\nsuch as the n-sphere S^n and n-torus T^n, the projective spaces RP^n and\nCP^n, and their generalizations, matrix groups such as the rotation group SO(n), etc. Differentiable\nmanifolds naturally appear in various applications, e.g., as configuration spaces in mechanics. They are arguably the most general objects\non which calculus can be developed. On the other hand, differentiable manifolds provide for calculus a powerful invariant geometric language,\nwhich is used in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications.\n\nIn this course we give an introduction to the theory of manifolds, including their definition and examples; vector fields and differential\nforms; integration on manifolds and de Rham cohomology.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this unit successful students will be able to:\n\ndeal with various examples of differentiable manifolds and smooth maps;\n\nhave familiarity with tangent vectors, tensors and differential forms;\n\nwork practically with vector fields and differential forms;\n\nappreciate the basic ideas of de Rham cohomology and its examples;\n\napply the ideas of differentiable manifolds to other areas.\n\nFuture topics requiring this course unit\n\nDifferentiable manifolds are used in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications, including physics and engineering.\nThe following course units are specifically based on MATH31061/MATH41061 Differentiable Manifolds:\nMATH41122 Differential Geometry; MATH41101 Geometric Cobordism Theory\n\nSyllabus\n\nManifolds and smooth maps.

    "text": "Topology is a major branch of modern mathematics. Topology is often described as rubber sheet geometry. In geometry objects are considered rigid with fixed distances and angles, but in topology distances and angles can be deformed. In topology objects are treated as if they are made out of rubber, capable of being deformed.\nObjects are allowed to be bent, stretched or shrunk but not allowed to be ripped apart or cut.\n\nFor example, in topology a coffee mug and a doughnut are the same! This kind of equivalence is cleverly illustrated by the following animated gif written by Lucas V. Barbosa.\n\nIn this course we will develop the mathematical framework to understand some of these ideas.\n\nThe authors of our textbook write:\n\nTopology\nis generally considered to be one of the three linchpins of modern\nabstract mathematics (along with analysis and algebra). In the early\nhistory of topology, results were primarily motivated by investigations\nof real-world problems. Then, after the formal foundation for topology\nwas established in the first part of the twentieth century, the\nemphasis turned to its abstract development. However, within the past\nfew decades there has been a significant increase in the applications\nof topology to fields as diverse as economics, engineering, chemistry,\nmedicine, and cosmology.\n\nWhen\nyour instructor was a student (in the middle of the last century)\ntopologists never talked about applications – it is exciting to see the\nrange of applications that have been found for this abstract subject.\nBecause we have limited class time, our emphasis will be an\nintroduction to the theory of point-set topology (text chapters 0-7).\nStudents may wish to pursue some of these applications for individual\nprojects.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nMost of the work you will need to do in this class will require reading the textbook and solving homework exercises (these will focus on creating and explaining mathematical arguments). I\nexpect you to work collaboratively with other students and I hope you\nwill talk to me about any exercises you are unsure about (either face\nto face or via email). I will try to give sufficient lead time to make\nthis possible. Although I encourage you to work with others, I want\nyou to write up your solutions individually.\n\nIn\naddition to reading your homework exercises and talking with you in\nclass, I'd like you to take a few minutes each weekend to send me a\nbrief update on how things are going (an email journal).\nI won't grade these critically but I hope they will give me some\nguidance on how things are progressing and I will record that you have\nsent them.\n\nAfter we've worked through some preliminary definitions, I'd like you to think about possible topics for an individual project.\nThere are many topics in the textbook that I will not have time to\ndiscuss in class and you might want to choose one of these. (We'll\nstart putting together a list of topics and scheduling presentations\nafter the first six weeks.)

If you miss one day of class during the summer session, it's\nalmost as bad as missing an entire week during the fall or spring.\n\nWork Load:\nA standard rule of thumb for math classes is that you should\nstudy 2-3 hours outside of class for each hour spent in class. We are\nscheduled to meet 9 hours per week in class. This leaves an additional\n18-27 hours per week to study outside of class.\n\nGrading:\nThere will be daily reading and homework, but your grade will only\nbe based upon your score on the 4 tests. No make-ups will be given\nfor any of these tests. If you miss a test for any reason, you will\nget a 0 on that test. There will be an optional cumulative\ntest on the last day of class which can replace the lowest of your\n4 test scores. There will be no final exam.",

An example of the associative property is 5 + (1 + 2) = (5 + 1) + 2. Whether we add 1 + 2 and then add 5 to that, or add 5 + 1 and then add that result to 2, we will obtain the same result.\n\nAssociative property of multiplication\n\nThe property that tells us that when we multiply three numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we group together first to multiply; the result will be the same. An example of the associative property of multiplication is\n2 x (5 x 3) = (2 x 5) x 3.\n\nAsymptote\n\nA line that a curve continues to approach but never actually touches.

    "text": "Specification\n\nAims\n\nTo give an introduction to Lebesgue's theory of measure and integration on the set of real numbers R. To use this to find an appropriate setting in which to understand the convergence of Fourier series.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nIt is often convenient to represent functions as Fourier series. However, the convergence of such series is a delicate issue closely related to the theory of integration. A standard approach to integration on the real line, formalised by Riemann, is based on partitioning the domain into smaller intervals. (This theory was described in MATH20101 but is not a prerequisite for the course.) This approach works in many situations but there are simple examples for which it fails. In the early 1900s, H. Lebesgue produced a better theory in which the key idea is to extend the notion of length from intervals to more complicated subsets of R. This started an area of mathematics it its own right, called Measure Theory. Most generally, this is about how one may sensibly assign a size to members of a collection of sets. One application of Lebesgue's ideas is that one can introduce a vector space of functions in which Fourier series appear in a natural way.\n\nThis course will appeal to students who have enjoyed MATH20101 or MATH20111 and MATH20122. It will be useful to student taking probability course courses in years three and four since the ideas of measure theory have a central role in probability theory.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this course unit students will\n\nunderstand how Lebesgue measure on R is defined,\n\nunderstand how measures may be used to construct integrals,\n\nknow the basic convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral,\n\nunderstand the relation between Fourier series and the Hilbert space of square integrable functions.",

    "text": "In this Unit we deal with trigonometric identities. These identities are particularly useful in doing the algebra of trigonometry.

In this unit we will explore some general ideas to prove an identity, and in doing so provide an opportunity for you to pass this on to your learners, in order to improve their mathematics problem solving skills.\n\nThe usual approach to identities is the memorisation of the basic identities with little or no reference to the graphical meaning of the identities.

The way it is structured is that your ability to answer or not answer questions guides you to different sections within the book. The first chapter starts off with a preview quiz, to get you started on your path. Yet the very first question on the quiz has the wrong answer. So when you check your results and think you got it wrong - try it again. The answer given is off by 20. This would be unbelievable in a self teaching guide if I didn't have it right in front of me. I can understand a mistake here and there, but the very first question??!! And, of course, no way to contact the authors to see if they have released accurate answers or let them know. Now the entire book is suspect.

Along these lines, we will provide an introduction to Galois Theory and a glimpse of algebraic number theory. Applications here will be made to the questions of solutions of equations by radicals, determining Pythagorean triples, expressing integers as sums of two squares, etc.\n\nA second main topic will be an introduction to transformational geometry, the study of rigid motions in the plane. Application here will be made to congruence and similarity of geometric figures, a classification of the conic sections and a foundation for trigonometry.\n\nThese topics can be discussed very fruitfully on many different levels.

    "text": "the only conceptual demand that is somewhat independent of the context is manipulating the algebraic expression to yield simpler algebraic expressions. That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to \"demonstrate further\" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. \"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.\n\nEven when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation.\n\nPredicting Patterns\n\nTasks involving geometric and numerical patterns are a frequent means of introducing students to the use of algebra for predicting.

    "text": "Mathematics\n\nWhy study Mathematics?\n\nAn essential element of mathematical learning is the development of mathematical knowledge in a way which encourages confidence and provides satisfaction and enjoyment. It is expected that students will gain an appreciation of the use of mathematical skills within other subjects as well as an understanding of problem solving in the real world.\n\nWhich specification is followed?\n\nGirls in Lower School follow the National Framework for Mathematics as laid down by the National Curriculum and the National Numeracy Strategy. From Lower 4 onwards pupils are taught in sets according to attainment.\n\nIn 2009, Bradford Girls' Grammar School embarked on the iGCSE course following the Edexcel specification. Candidates are encouraged to develop a feel for numbers; to recognise patterns and relationships; to generalise results; and to use the language of mathematics to communicate their ideas effectively and efficiently. All candidates will be studying a course leading to the higher tier examinations, but individual students may be entered at Foundation Level if appropriate. The iGCSE does not have a coursework element. Marks are obtained from sitting two examination papers at the end of Upper 5. The iGCSE is an excellent preparation for students intending to study mathematics at A-level.\n\nMathematics and Further Mathematics are offered at both AS and A level following the Edexcel specifications. In recent years the role of Further Mathematics has changed. It is seen as enriching and deepening the curriculum: truly further maths rather than just harder maths – it provides able students with a course which stimulates them mathematically and prepares them for a wide range of higher education options.\n\nAt A level students study three main areas of mathematics:\n\nPure (or Core) Mathematics which develops and extends topics already met at GCSE including algebra, trigonometry and graphs, it also introduce new topics such as calculus.\n\nStatistics which includes the presentation, analysis and interpretation of data and the study of probability.\n\nMechanics which involves the study of the motion of objects and how they respond to forces acting on them.\n\nFurther Mathematics will cover Decision Mathematics in addition to the three areas mentioned above.\n\nWorkshops, conferences and visits\n\nMathematics workshops are offered during lunchtimes, providing help and support to students in all years.\n\nGirls throughout Bradford Girls' Grammar School participate in the Mathematical challenges, including the Junior and Senior Team Challenges, run by the UK Mathematics Trust.\n\nDegree and career choices\n\nThere are many opportunities to study Mathematics in the Sixth Form at Bradford Girls' Grammar and it is an excellent support subject for any combination of 'A' levels. It is not an easy subject to study at this level and its academic rigour means that it is highly valued by universities for entry into most degree programme,s particularly the sciences, geography, economics, psychology, medicine and engineering.",

Math Center Level 1 consists of Graphing calculator 2D, Advanced Calculator, Simple Calculator, Simple Calculator, Simple Rational Calculator, and Simple Integer Calculator called from the Control Panel. Simple calculator is a general purpose calculator which combines use simplicity and calculation power. It handles simple arithmetic operations and complex formulas. Advanced Calculator is a step farther in complexity comparing to the Simple Calculator. The Advanced Calculator has two editing windows. One is for editing x, and the second is for editing f(x). In the x window you can enter any number or formula which contains numbers. In the f(x) window you can enter formulas containing numbers and formulas containing x. First, x will be calculated. Then the result for x will be substituted into the formula for f(x). The presence of two editing windows demands switching between windows. You can do it by clicking buttons \"go to x\" and \"go to f(x)\", or by clicking inside the window. If you forget to enter x, then the x=1 will be assumed. If you forget to enter f(x), then f(x)=x will be assumed. Advanced Calculator works in scientific mode. All numbers in internal calculations are treated in scientific format. Graphing Calculator 2D has two panels. The Left Panel has the Magnifying Square represented by Small Square with gray border on the Left Panel. It is 16 times smaller than the Left Panel. The Right Panel shows content of the Magnifying Square magnified 16 times. You can press button \"zoom +\". Then the Left and Right Panels will be zoomed twice each. Maximum zoom is 8 (tree clicks of \"zoom +\").

I don't know what exactly yet but probably some discrete math (comp. science), probability/statistics, maybe quantum-mechanics,....\n\nI've a not so profound background in math (just rusty high-school knowledge) and want to brush it up a little through self-study...\n\nI've read about 'The Princeton Companion to Mathematics' being good for someone with my background?\n\nThe Princeton Companion is not for this level of brush-up. It's the sort of book that you would use to explore new topics that you might not have seen before.\n\nQuote:\n\nAm I missing some more general topics or good resources?\n\nIf you're interested in getting deeper into math, you'll probably want to find a book that helps you to transition from computation into proof-based mathematics. Proofs are things that you don't really see in the high school math level. I like \"How to Think Like a Mathematician\" as a much gentler introduction than the more classic \"A Transition to Advanced Mathematics\" (and much less expensive).\n\nThere's another book on the market called \"How to Prove It\" but I've not read it so I can't say how good/bad it is. It seems to have decent reviews.\n\nDoing questions/exercises is essential for quick progress in low-level maths.\n\nIn some of MIT's modules there are example sheets & solutions, which is good.\n\nBasically, I would start by going and getting a basic book off amazon on algebra and/or geometry. Maybe a standard book on it, or just a questions and answer book.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"algebra\" though, as algebra is quite broad.\n\nBut yeah, work through a million questions, get used to things... don't be afraid to ask stuff on internet forums (like on 2+2) and also it's good to ask people you know if they're good enough and are willing to teach you a thing or two.\n\nI'm not a math guy but this seems a bit narrow. I don't know how you'd get a good general overview, because there are dozens or hundreds of mathematical fields, often with overlap, but I know calculus and ODEs and I wouldn't say I \"know math\" even remotely.\n\nIt seems like abstract algebra is a good starting place since people who do \"know math\" seem to reference it a lot - set theory and number theory maybe? College-level geometry would probably be nice. Mathematical logic? Complex analysis?\n\nI've learned some things in data structures, algorithms, numerical analysis, combinatorics, and computability theory, mostly as a result of reading about computer programming. That stuff is awesome to me but I don't even know how you'd get there from a \"general mathematics\" background. If you want computer math I recommend those topics though, I doubt you can do much with computers unless you have at least data structures, algorithms, and computability theory - but for \"more discrete\" tasks combinatorics is a must, and for \"more continuous\" tasks you really need numerical analysis. Might even want to study some more programming-related stuff too, knowing how floating-point types are implemented would be awfully valuable if you ever want to do math-related code.\n\nI'll use 'How to Think Like a Mathematician' by Kevin Houston and skip 'The Princeton Companion' for now. Proofs seem to be very important and indeed in high-school we focused on computations.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by jewbinson\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"algebra\" though, as algebra is quite broad.\n\nThat's just the high-school algebra I see often mentioned together with trigonometry as a prereq. for a course in calculus.\n\nI've already refreshed some high-school stuff. I think the free ebooks from CK12.org are good? Problems with exercercises or questions I can post on several fora.\n\nThe 4 MIT OCW courses are 'Scholar' math-courses, specifically designed for self-study. I've already gone through some lectures on Calculus I and I think it's all pretty good organised (recitation videos, worked examples, exams (+solutions),... ).\nI also read when you're a Math Major (General Option) those 4 courses are required while the rest is flexible.\nThis is probably indeed far from a 'decent general background' but I guess I need to start somewhere.\n\nThanks. I think the information in your thread is going to be very helpful once I finish my 4 OCW Scholar courses. Right now I just finished Unit 1 (Differentiation) of Calculus 1, still a long way to go.\n\n\nThey have free courses for computer science and they just added a statistics 101 course, which has programming involved. It's a cool concept. They show short, well made video's, which are then followed up by questions you can answer to show you understood.\n\nUnfortunately, it's been crazy easy so far. They are still adding the units for the statistics, so I'm assuming it will get more relevant (it's supposed to be university level).",

    "text": "Continuing Education\n\nQ: As a mathematical amateur no longer attending university, I miss the stimulation\nof taking a math course. If my interest were modern languages (for example), I\ncould take what they call 'continuing education' courses at almost any college\nor university, but for the mathematical enthusiast these institutions seemingly\nhave nothing. Can anybody suggest a comparable alternative?\n\nA:Why does 'continuing education' not include (at least potentially) math? At one\nuniversity I know (George Mason U.), they have a category called 'Extended Studies',\nopen more-or-less to anyone paying the tuition, and it is certainly possible to take\ncourses (including graduate-level) under that dispensation. There may be limits on\nhow many you can take, etc., but it is routinely used by non-students who want to\nsample a course or two, for genuine 'continuing education', or as a way to help\ndecide if they want to enroll in a degree program. (And if they do, the courses\ntaken under Extended Studies count.) Not all colleges/universities are going to be\nthat open, nor should they be. But many are. The kind of program that would be\nideal for you is the Johns Hopkins Part-time Programs in Science/Engineering\n( which has math courses (which I've taken.) You are\nprobably not near the JH area (Baltimore/Washington), but I mention it to indicate\nthat such programs do exist. These programs, like Mason, consciously cater to a\nbroad professional audience, people already working in a field who would like to\ntake a course here-and-there, or even work on an advanced degree in the evening.\nFor that to be possible the university must be located in an area that has such a\npotential clientele, which generally means a large urban area. If you're not in\nsuch a locale, it may not be possible to find what you want. But if you are, and if\nthere are several colleges around, I'd bet an aggressive search would turn up\nsomething.\nSupposedly, MIT has put all its courses online for free. (Which means\nthe materials are out there, but not so much the instruction.) The\ntrouble you run into is that there is not too much demand for an\nevening course or a satellite campus course in Abstract Algebra\n(although this does happen under some circumstances.) So it's hard\nto convince a dean to \"waste\" a faculty member on a course with an\nenrollment of 2.",

Covering triangle congruence, postulates and theorems, surface area and volume, two-column proofs, vector addition, and slopes and equations of lines, Saxon features all the topics covered in a standard high school geometry course. Two-tone illustrations help students really \"see\" the geometric concepts, while sidebars provide additional notes, hints, and topics to think about. Parents will be able to easily help their students with the solutions manual, which includes step-by-step solutions to each problem in the student book; and quickly assess performance with the test book (test answers included). Tests are designed to be administered after every five lessons after the first ten.\n\nPlease Note: This is the third printing and errors to date have been corrected.\n\nProduct Reviews\n\nSaxon Geometry Homeschool Kit\n3.9\n5\n16\n16\n\nPoorly written textbook\nI have used Saxon for about 20 years so when they came out with a Geometry text I was pleased because this was lacking in the other texts. I've been highly disappointed. Number one, I was assured that I had the new solutions manual when I ordered but sadly there are many errors, as well as leaving out crucial steps in order to follow their solution. I have found solutions with concepts that have not even been taught. Number two, the text is just poorly written in general. The problem set questions are hard to understand what they are looking for. The explanations in the text are vague at best. I have had to rely on my engineering son to help me solve some problems for his youngest brother. This text does not hold up to the standard of the older textbooks. Don't buy it. You will be frustrated.\nApril 10, 2013\n\nIt's Saxon, what else can you say\nMy daughters were doing Switched on Schoolhouse Algebra. Both were lost.

My son learned Algebra II with the first and I highly recommend this product. The instructor does a terrific job of going over everything and the syllabus he provides with it takes the guess work out of the planning out a schedule for the whole school year.

    "text": "Classes are not aimed exclusively towards math competitions. Instead, IDEA Math is a program that can help students\ndevelop logical thinking and problem solving skills in the long run. We have found that our program not only broadens and\ndeepens the students' knowledge and skills in mathematics, but also help them develop perseverance and creativity that\nwill benefit them in the long-run, regardless of their career paths.\n\nI have taken IDEA MATH classes last year, will the classes be repeated for next year?\n\nWe have reorganized our series this year so that the majority of the material will be brand new. In future\nyears, students could choose to move up from one series to another. Moreover, if a student chooses to be in a series for two\nyears in a row, we will insert new problems and concepts into that series from year to year.\n\nHow am I (the student) evaluated? Are there any evaluation tests?\n\nDuring each of the 6-week courses, there will be two 1 to 1.5 hour tests to check each student's progress. One test will be in\nthe middle of the course, and the other will be at the end. The tests are intended as check points. They\nare not evaluations.\n\nSince we focus on contest preparation, there will be various forms of mock contests. Scores/results will be\nkept only for the purpose of practicing, not for evaluation. We try to use these activities to stimulate students' interest and\nget them used to the contest atmosphere, instead of pressuring them through evaluation.\n\nWho shall I meet at IDEA MATH?\n\nOther capable students from the Massachusetts area who are passionate about mathematics. Many of our students have developed\nlasting friendships with their IDEA MATH peers, and many have learned a great deal from their peers as well as their instructors.\n\nWhat is the difference between IDEA MATH and what I am learning in school?\n\nThe depth. At IDEA MATH, we do not focus on introducing students to higher math concepts, say Calculus. However, we go into\nmuch greater depth with topics covered in a middle/high school curriculum. For example, an eighth grade geometry math class may\ncover the triangle are formula of base times height divided by two, but our Math Roots Series will introduce students to three\nor four more important ways to calculate the same area. Students will see the connection between these different ways.\n\nCan I sit in for a class?\n\nUsually we do not allow sit-ins. However, we do encourage all prospective students to join us for the Open House.\n\nApplication\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nYou need do online registration first (creat your account), take the evaluation test, and then register course online.\n\nSmall Group and Private Lessons\n\nDo you offer private lessons?\n\nYes. We offer lessons for all mathematical subjects, standardized tests and competitions for small groups and individuals.\n\nHow do I schedule a private or small group lesson?\n\nPlease call (603)686-1706 or email info@ideamath.org.\n\nWhat is the rate of private and small group lesson?\n\nThe price varies by the subjects, levels and the group's size, with a range from $40 to $100 per hour per person.\nPlease contact us for specifics.",

It is probably equally clear that this dramatic development of science and technology is only possible because of our ability to think creatively, consistently and logically. Indeed, there seems to be a parallelism, a consistency, between the rules that govern logical thought and the rules that govern the functions of the physical universe. The physical universe is quite logical and consistent. It reveals its secrets to those who study it using creative, consistent and logical thought. And for the development of one's ability to exercise this very useful way of thinking there is probably no better approach than through the study of mathematics.\n\nSo welcome to the Department of Mathematics where you will have the opportunity to hone your thinking skills by taking some of our twenty four courses in algebra, statistics, trigonometry, calculus and differential equations. In addition to improving your ability to think clearly, you will also learn about many of the astounding mathematical discoveries that have been made throughout the centuries and how they can be used for practical applications in science, engineering, business and the health fields.\n\nI encourage you to humbly and enthusiastically place yourself in the hands of our experienced and capable faculty who are fully devoted to teaching you mathematics. If you do this, you will be taken on an intellectual journey to fascinating places that you cannot easily imagine. You will come away not only well prepared with the technical knowledge you need for your chosen career or field of study, but with an enhanced ability to think more clearly, more deeply, more rigorously, more analytically and more precisely about yourself and everything you encounter.

    "text": "Mathematics Requirements by Major\n\nThis information is designed to help students who participate in the Early Mathematics Placement Tool (EMPT) program for high school juniors to interpret and assess their test scores in relation to requirements at University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Technical College System campuses.\n\nThe score report, which each student receives, indicates the level at which the student would likely start, if he or she were to take a mathematics course right now, at one of the University of Wisconsin System or Wisconsin Technical College System campuses. The descriprions of the levels are provided for each odd number scale point. Students placing at an even numbered scale point have skills that fall between those provided for the points immediately above and below it.\n\nA broad description of the Early Mathematics Placement Tool levels appears below. How the levels are defined in terms of actual courses may vary from campus to campus and can be found in the beginning course sequence chart for each campus.\n\nThe campus specific information also outlines the minimum mathematics requirements for specific college majors. Students can find out what mathematics course they are prepared for at this time and how many more mathematics courses they would need to fulfill requirements of a particular institution or major program.\n\nWith this information, students will have a chance to improve their mathematics preparation in high school by taking an appropriate mathematics course in their senior year. A mathematics teacher or counselor can assist students in interpreting the EMPT results as related to students' college aspirations and suggest an appropriate mathematics course to bridge any gaps in their mathematics preparation. Even if students are right on track in their mathematics preparation, they should enroll in a mathematics class in their senior year, because mathematics skills tend to become rusty if not continuously practiced.\n\nAdequate mathematics preparation prior to entering college saves a student both time and money. A student taking high school level courses at college must pay tuition, but does not receive credits which count towards a college degree. Such a student thereby extends the time it takes to finish college with a degree.\n\nPlease note that both mathematics curricula and majors requirements are continually reviewed by campuses and thus the information contained in this booklet is fluid. Students should always check with their intended campus prior to enrolling for the most up-to-date information.\n\nThe UW System Mathematics Placement Test is required of students entering a UW institution. It is similar to the EMPT but somewhat longer. Hopefully, for students taking a college preparatory mathematics course in their senior year, the UW Mathematics Placement Test scores will be higher than the EMPT scores. But they could turn out lower if students do not take such a mathematics course.\n\nDescription of Early Mathematics Placement Tool Levels\n\nLevel 1\n\nStudents at Level 1 have a weakness in basic mathematics skills and need to commit to a great deal of preparation in order to be ready for college-level mathematics. If preparation is not undertaken in high school, the student will start the college mathematics course sequence at the lowest level and will pay for mathematics courses which do not count toward his/her degree.\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nStudents at Level 3 demonstrate skills in basic mathematics, but have weaknesses in algebra. Students at this level need to commit to further algebra preparation in order to be ready for college-level mathematics. If preparation is not undertaken in high school, the student will most likely start the college mathematics course sequence at a low level and will pay for mathematics courses which will not count toward his/her degree.\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 5\n\nStudents at Level 5 have basic algebra skills and are usually ready for a college algebra course. Further strengthening of these skills is usually required for most college and university programs.\n\nLevel 6\n\nLevel 7\n\nStudents at Level 7 have the algebra skills to take courses at the pre-calculus level, but need to develop better algebra and trigonometry skills to take calculus.\n\nLevel 8\n\nLevel 9\n\nStudents at Level 9 have the skills required for the calculus sequence.",

    "text": "A book on basic math that explains how math really works\n\nA book on basic math that explains how math really works\n\nPlease, recommend me a book (or books) on basic math/pre-algebra that really explains how math works from the inside out. What I mean by that is a book that goes really deeply into exploring math giving you true understanding of what's going on behind the scenes so to speak. For example, why the long division method even works, why when dividing one fraction by another fraction is supposed to be carried out the way it is, why dividing by zero doesn't really make much sense, why a negative number multiplied by another negative number gives a positive number and stuff like that. So a book that gives the basis for basic math and arithmetics. Not like the books which only explain how to superficially perform math operations and algorithms. I looked into the for dummies series, but they are all like that, don't provide you with that kind of explanation.\n\nI don't really think that such a book exists. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of books that explain exactly what you want. A lot of books explain how the long division works, how multiplication of fractions works, why multiplication of negative numbers result in a positive number. The problem is that such a book is usually quite advanced. The subject that treats such questions is abstract algebra, and it's a college-level math course.\n\nFurthermore, if you want everything to be explained, then you will need to deal with proofs. So before reading abstract algebra, you should read up on mathematical proofs.\n\nIf you wish to try out abstract algebra, then I can recommend the book \"A first course in Algebra\" by Fraleigh. Everybody who is familiar with proofs will be able to tackle this book. But it will still be a difficult read.\nIf you want to do proofs and sets first, then Velleman's \"how to prove it\" is a good read.\n\nI realize that I have not been helpful at all. As I understood your questions, you wanted easy books that explain everything. I have given you hard books. The problem is that there are no easy books that explain it all (as far as I'm aware). I think your best bet is posting the questions you have on the forums here. That way you won't have to read an entire book.\n\nAlgebra by Gelfand is well motivated and fairly rigorous (at least for high school algebra standards). Lectures on Elementary Mathematics by Lagrange also seems to be like something you are looking for (you may find it online here).\n\nMost arithmetic algorithmic (e.g. long/synthetic division, multiplication with multi-digit numbers, &c.), however, are things that you should easily be able to justify on your own if you know a bit of algebra.\n\nIf you want to find out how mathematics is done, I'd recommend watching Vi Hart's Youtube channel and reading Hilbert's Geometry and Imagination.\n\nMacLane? Really? That may be too advanced, don't you think? The OP asks for a book on basic math/pre-algebra!\n\nWell, I've read just the beginning, but it seems any person could understand a lot of this book. Look at wiki entry. I guess at least first part of the book is readable by anyone. It definitely is \"behind the scenes\" book. But yeah, this is perhaps too much philosophy, it seems the OP is looking for something more practical.\n\nI think it to a large degree is a matter of psychological satisfaction, which can vary between individuals; some people ask the question \"Why?\" more often than others. Eventually, you'll hit a wall where you feel satisfied with the mathematical theory \"behind\" things. Personally, I'm using \"Basic Mathematics\" by Serge Lang as complementary studying in high school right now, and I think it's enough for me. However, it's probably not for you because it assumes some things without proof, like distributivity, associativity and commutativity. I, on the other hand, think it's OK to do so since I think I have a sufficient intuitive understanding why those properties must be true.\n\nI would suggest that you look into the above mentioned books and see if something fits you. Good luck!",

    "text": "The study of Mathematics has been a fundamental part of education since ancient times and has lost none of its relevance in modern times. In fact, much the contrary. Mathematics permeates our lives, enables us to communicate across vast distances, shrinks our technology to the palm of our hands, and opens up more and more of the nature of the world to our investigations.\n\nWe understand full well that many of our students come to use with little of this sense of wonder, rather with a sense of fear and apprehension.\n\nWe strive constantly to meet our students where they are, bring them into a new relationship with mathematics, and open up the possibilities of mathematics for them and for their careers.\n\nMath\n\nCurriculum\n\nThe Mathematics department curriculum has two components, one developmental, the other college-level.\n\nThe Developmental Mathematics Program\n\nFor those that are not ready to undertake college-level mathematics, either because they have been away from the subject for a while or because they have yet to fully grasp the fundamentals and put them into practice, the developmental mathematics program provides coursework for students demonstrating deficiencies in mathematical skills. MATH 049, Elementary Algebra, and MATH 149, Intermediate Algebra are consecutive 3-unit courses that prepare students for college-level work in mathematics. We also offer a self-paced version of Intermediate Algebra (MATH 1491) for those who fall somewhere in-between these two traditional courses. Placement in these classes is based on a proficiency examination score. A grade of \"C\" (2.0) or higher in MATH 049 is required to enroll in MATH 149. A grade of \"C\" (2.0) or higher in MATH 149 or 1491 is required to enroll in college level mathematics courses.\n\nThe College-Level Mathematics Program\n\nAll university students are required to complete at least one college-level mathematics course. Many departments ask for an additional mathematics course, so please check your major department's course requirements. College-level mathematics courses are designated with a number in the 200s, such as Business Math and Statistics, College Algebra and Trigonometry with Descriptive Geometry. In addition, the department may occasionally offer lower- or upper-division topics courses in mathematics.\n\nFor more information about the Mathematics department curriculum, contact Prof. Marty Tippens, Chair, at marty.tippens@woodbury.edu",

    "text": "ACCELERATED PRE-CALCULUS SUMMER STUDY GUIDE\n\nCHAPTER 12: SETS, RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n\nA \"set\" is a collection of \"objects.\" Each object in the set is called an \"element of the set.\" The elements usually have something in common.\n\nFor example, the following, {monkey, bear, lion, giraffe, zebra}, is called a set of elements. What do these elements have in common? One answer might be that they are animals in a local zoo.\n\nNotice the symbols \"{\" and \"}\". We will call theses symbols \"set enclosures.\"\"{\" is the \"left set enclosure\" and \"}\" is the \"right set enclosure.\"\n\nThe following set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10,...} is a collection of objects that are numbers. The elements are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and what these elements have in common is that they are positive even numbers. Notice that the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10,...} has 3 periods after the number 10. These three periods, called \"ellipsis,\" mean \"and so forth\" or suggest that the elements in a set continue on forever or as mathematicians say \"continue on to infinity.\"\n\nWhen we need to represent some \"recognizable pattern\" mathematicans often use ellipsis. Consider the following set: {3, 6, 9,..., 90, 93, 96}. I have left out many numbers from this set but the ellipses suggest I am incrementing each subsequent number by 3 and the set contains all the numbers incremented by 3, starting at 3, going to the number 96.\n\nCan you see the pattern in the following? {...1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...} If you take any number in this set and multiply it by 2 you will get the next number in the set. Pattern recognition skills are very important in the world of mathematics!\n\nSECTION 12.2: DOMAIN, RANGE, RELATION\n\nLet's look at this set: { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } This is a set of ordered pairs which can be used to represent points in the Cartesian Coordinate System. The points below can be represented by our set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }.\n\nThe set of x-values of a set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is named the \"domain.\" The domain in this instance is {-2, 1, -1, 5}.\n\nThe set of y-values of a set of ordered pairs is named the \"range.\" The range in this instance is {4, 3, -2, -3}.\n\nThe set of ordered pairs is also named a \"relation.\" So { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is a relation.\n\nans: The domain is {5, 4, 3, 6} and the range is {–3, 6, –1, 3} Comment: Notice that the x coordinate, 5, occurs twice in {(5, –3), (4, 6), (3, –1), (6, 6), (5, 3)}. Mathematicians have agreed to write an x value in the domain once even though it may occur more than once in the relation. The same goes for the range: notice the y coordinate 6 occurs twice in the relation but is written only once in the range.\n\nThere is a very special \"relation\" called a \"function.\" Functions are very powerful in the world of applications as we will see in Chapter 16 of this manual.\n\nWHAT IS A FUNCTION?\n\nIf each x-value of a relation has one unique y-value assigned to it, then the relation is named a \"function.\"\n\nex. 1) { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function! Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. Note the ordered pairs in blue. The x-value 1 has two different y-values, 3 and 5.\nHence, we say { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function.\n\nex. 2) { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is called a function.\nWhy? Because each x-value has only 1 y value.\n\nex. 3) { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function. Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. The x-value -7 has three different y-values 5,4,and -2. Hence, we say { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function.\n\nex. 4) { (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) } is a function.\nWhy? Because each unique x-value has only 1 y-value.\n\nCOMMENT: All functions are relations but not all relations are functions. Remember, a relation is nothing more than a set of ordered pairs.\n\n12.4 GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS VERSES NON-FUNCTIONS\n\nA set of ordered pairs that is a function will have more than one point falling on a vertical line. Let's compare the graph of a function to a graph of a non function.\n\nFUNCTION\n\nNOT A FUNCTION\n\n{ (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }\n\n{ (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }\n\nFUNCTION\n\nNOT A FUNCTION\n\n{ (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) }\n\n{ (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) }\n\nWe will be looking at functions in greater depth in chapter 16. This was a brief introduction.",

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. This short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word \"algebra\" broadly, defining it as a \"method of solving problems by honest confession of one's ignorance\". Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra's essential element is \"the habitual registration of the exact limits of one's knowledge\" and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation.

    "text": "CalcPlot3D, an Exploration Environment for Multivariable Calculus\n\nUsing CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus\n\nOne way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures. I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments. Before giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board. Once students have seen one example using the applet, most have little trouble completing the exercise on their own.\n\nWithout further discussion, let's look at some examples of how this can be done! As you develop your own examples, please send them along to me! I would love to develop a library of useful ways to use this applet.",

But that's all you'll be able to do. If you learn a little more, you'll be able to go much further. And you'll be able to make more sense of the maths on Wikipedia.\n\n>>They don't teach any useful math at school and they aren't any time soon so I don't know where to start learning\n\nDon't forget that it's more important to a teacher that the dull students aren't left behind, than the bright students get ahead. Maybe you can find a teacher who is willing to explain something to you outside of class. Or maybe a parent or relative of yours could help.\n\nAt my school there was a maths society where we explored topics outside of the curriculum...\n\nHaving a good teacher is probably the best way to learn this sort of stuff, but failing that a good book might be helpful. Check your library for something that's at the right level for you.\n\n>>And I don't what this type of stuff means:\n\n>>sin^2 (x) <<????\n\nBasically, computer programmers need to make sure the computer understands them. Mathematicians need to make sure that other mathematicians understand them. So while programming languages tend to be fairly simple and consistent, mathematical notation is much less so.\n\nAlso remember that mathematics until recently was nearly always written by hand, and even today much is written by hand. A notation that's easier to read in slightly messy writing is a winner.\n\nThere are many areas of mathematics where there are a few different notations in popular usage. Often say Europe will use one notation and the US will use another.\n\nAnyway, this is one case where \"everybody knows\" that sin^2(x) means sin(x)*sin(x). Just learn it.\n\n>>$variable = new variabletype();\n\nThis is to do with object oriented programming, a big topic that I don't think you should worry about just yet.

    "text": "Modern Methods in Combinatorics\n\nObjectives :\n\nFor a long time, Combinatorics was considered mainly as recreational mathematics. But in the past few decades, it has emerged as a mainstream area, with rich connections with more classical ones such as algebra, topology, geometry and probability theory. Moreover, because of its close links with computer science, Combinatorics has become a crucial scientific endeavor.\n\nBesides classical tools, like the pigeonhole principle, the inclusion-exclusion principle, the double counting argument, induction, Ramsey argument, etc., some recent tools (the probabilistic, the algebraic, the linear algebra, the analytical and the topological methods) have shown their surprising power in solving a lot of combinatorial problems (classical and new ones). For example, with a mere knowledge of the concepts of linear independence and discrete probability, beautiful connections can be made between algebra, probability, and combinatorics. These new techniques have also found striking applications in other areas of discrete mathematics and the theory of computing.\n\nDespite the beauty, the breadth and depth of results and applications of Combinatorics, research and teaching in this field are underrepresented in Argentina and South America. One of the main purposes of this school is to change this situation, by bringing a \"guided tour\" covering its most important branches, and by demonstrating its methods and power. Another related objective is the creation of research and academic networks and to build a frame for the interchange of ideas in this field.\n\nAdministrative and scientific coordinators\n\nDaniel A Jaume, Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentine djaume@unsl.edu.ar\n\nDate and location :\n\nJuly 22-August 2, 2013, San Luis, Argentina\n\nScientific program :\n\nA. 11 basic courses for undergraduate students\n\nB. 7 advanced courses for graduate students\n\nC. 4 lectures on the state-of-the-art\n\nD.

    "text": "This collection is included inLens:Community College Open Textbook Collaborative By: CC Open Textbook Collaborative Algebra: VectorsFor our purposes, a vector is a collection of real numbers in a one-\ndimensional array.1 We usually think of the array as being arranged in a\ncolumn and write\n\nx=x1x2x3|xnx=x1x2x3|xn.\n\nNotice that we indicate a vector with boldface and the constituent elements\nwith subscripts. A real number by itself is called a scalar, in distinction from\na vector or a matrix. We say that xx is an n-vector, meaning that xx has nn\nelements. To indicate that x1x1 is a real number, we write\n\nx1∈R,x1∈R,\n\n(1)\n\nmeaning that x1x1 is contained in RR, the set of real numbers. To indicate that\nxx is a vector of nn real numbers, we write\n\nx∈Rn,x∈Rn,\n\n(2)\n\nmeaning that xx is contained in RnRn, the set of real n-tuples. Geometrically,\nRnRnis n-dimensional space, and the notation x∈Rnx∈Rn means that xx is a\npoint in that space, specified by the nn coordinates x1,x2,...,xnx1,x2,...,xn. Figure 1\nshows a vector in R3R3, drawn as an arrow from the origin to the point xx.\nOur geometric intuition begins to fail above three dimensions, but the linear\nalgebra is completely general.\n\nFigure 1: A Vector in R3\n\nWe sometimes find it useful to sketch vectors with more than three\ndimensions in the same way as the three-dimensional vector of Figure 1. We\nthen consider each axis to represent more than one dimension, a hyperplane, in\nour n-dimensional space. We cannot show all the details of what is happening\nin n-space on a three-dimensional figure, but we can often show important\nfeatures and gain geometrical insight.\n\nVector Addition. Vectors with the same number of elements can be\nadded and subtracted in a very natural way:\n\nExample 1\n\nThe difference between the vector x=111x=111 and the\nvector y=001y=001 is the vector z=x-y=110z=x-y=110. These vectors are illustrated in Figure 2. You can see that this result is consistent with the definition of\nvector subtraction in Equation 3. You can also picture the subtraction in\nFigure 2 by mentally reversing the direction of vector yy to get -y-y and then\nadding it to xx by sliding it to the position where its tail coincides with the\nhead of vector xx. (The head is the end with the arrow.) When you slide a\nvector to a new position for adding to another vector, you must not change\nits length or direction.\n\nFigure 2: Subtraction of Vectors\n\nExercise 1\n\nCompute and plot x+yx+y and x-yx-y for each of the following\ncases:\n\nx=132,y=123x=132,y=123 ;\n\nx=-13-2,y=123x=-13-2,y=123 ;\n\nx=1-32,y=132x=1-32,y=132.\n\nScalar Product. Several different kinds of vector multiplication are\ndefined.2 We begin with the scalar product. Scalar multiplication is defined\nfor scalar aa and vector xx as\n\nax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.ax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.\n\n(4)\n\nIf |a|<1|a|<1, then the vector axax is \"shorter\" than the vector x; if |a|>1|a|>1, then the\nvector axax is '\"longer\" than x. This is illustrated for a 2-vector in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: The Scalar Product axax\n\nExercise 2\n\nCompute and plot the scalar product axax when x=11/2l/4x=11/2l/4 for\neach of the following scalars:\n\na=1;a=1;\n\na=-1;a=-1;\n\na=-1/4;a=-1/4;\n\na=2.a=2.\n\nExercise 3\n\nGiven vectors x,y,z∈Rnx,y,z∈Rn and the scalar a∈Ra∈R, prove the\nfollowing identities:\n\nFootnotes\n\nIn a formal development of linear algebra, the abstract concept of a\nvector space plays a fundamental role. We will leave such concepts to a\ncomplete course in linear algebra and introduce only the functional techniques\nnecessary to solve the problems at hand.\n\nThe division of two vectors is undefined, although three different \"divisions\" are defined",

    "text": "Measure and Integration. A Concise Introduction to Real Analysis\n\nJohn Wiley and Sons Ltd, July 2009, Pages: 238\n\nA uniquely accessible book for general measure and integration, emphasizing the real line, Euclidean space, and the underlying role of translation in real analysis\n\nMeasure and Integration: A Concise Introduction to Real Analysis presents the basic concepts and methods that are important for successfully reading and understanding proofs. Blending coverage of both fundamental and specialized topics, this book serves as a practical and thorough introduction to measure and integration, while also facilitating a basic understanding of real analysis.\n\nThe author develops the theory of measure and integration on abstract measure spaces with an emphasis of the real line and Euclidean space. Additional topical coverage includes:\n\nMeasure spaces, outer measures, and extension theorems\n\n- Lebesgue measure on the line and in Euclidean space\n\n- Measurable functions, Egoroff's theorem, and Lusin's theorem\n\n- Convergence theorems for integrals\n\n- Product measures and Fubini's theorem\n\n- Differentiation theorems for functions of real variables\n\n- Decomposition theorems for signed measures\n\n- Absolute continuity and the Radon-Nikodym theorem\n\n- Lp spaces, continuous-function spaces, and duality theorems\n\n- Translation-invariant subspaces of L2 and applications\n\nThe book's presentation lays the foundation for further study of functional analysis, harmonic analysis, and probability, and its treatment of real analysis highlights the fundamental role of translations. Each theorem is accompanied by opportunities to employ the concept, as numerous exercises explore applications including convolutions, Fourier transforms, and differentiation across the integral sign.\n\nProviding an efficient and readable treatment of this classical subject, Measure and Integration: A Concise Introduction to Real Analysis is a useful book for courses in real analysis at the graduate level.

    "text": "Number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers 1, 2, 3,..., and related objects that arise in their study. It is tempting to assume that something as simple as the counting numbers must be rather well understood. But this is far from the case! Indeed, number theory owes much of its charm to the wealth of easily-stated problems -- possible to explain to middle-school age children -- which have so far defied solution, despite hundreds of years of effort by great mathematicians.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the foundational results, with particular attention paid to some the pathbreaking accomplishments of the 18th and 19th centuries. We will start with the basic theory (factorization into primes) before turning to Gauss's theory of congruences. The theory of congruences culminates with a proof of Gauss's Aureum Theorema (golden theorem), the law of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nMore advanced topics will be discussed later in the course. Possibilities include theorems about sums of squares, results on arithmetic functions, and results on the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nNumber theory, more than some other areas of mathematics, is largely an experimental science. It is recommended (but not required) that you download software that allows you to play with very large numbers. This is a great way to get an intuitive handle on the results we discuss.\nCommercial packages of this sort include Maple and Mathematica, but there are also free (even open source!) options, such as gp/PARI.\n\nHW assignments will contain problems required of all students, as well as more challenging problems required only for MATH 6400 students. Undergraduate participants may do these additional problems for extra credit.\n\nYou are expected to participate in class. In particular, attendance in this course is\nrequired. More than four unexcused absences may result in you receiving a WF. Keep me posted whenever you have a conflict that requires you to miss class and this should not be an issue.\n\nAll exams are in-class, closed book and closed notes.\n\nHomework will be collected in class, about once each week. Late homework will not be accepted. (If you have a need to turn in HW early, that can be arranged.) Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the term.\n\nOn homework, collaboration is allowed and in fact is very much encouraged. Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently. Keep in mind that by entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA Honor code described in detail at <URL: \n\nIn practice, what this means that you may discuss homework problems and their solutions with your classmates, but you may not turn in a solution unless you understand it yourself. A reasonable rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain your solutions verbally to me (in all their gory detail) if requested to do so.\n\nThe withdrawal policy for this course is that if you withdraw within a week of the date the first midterm is handed back, you automatically qualify for a WP (assuming you are eligible by UGA's standards). After that point, it is at the discretion of the instructor (i.e., me) who will take your performance in the class to-date into account.\n\nSpecial accommodationsDisclaimer\n\nThis course syllabus provides a general plan for the course;\ndeviations may be necessary.",

However the world isn't quite a perfect sphere, and we do not always have the perfect situation. If you haven't fully study yet, the volume of material to cover in these last 24-48 hours may be too much, therefore we need a survey strategy. The following works best for computational subjects such as math, physics, chemistry or disciplines such as engineering.\n\nIf this is a college prep/standardized test, take the practice test again...\n\nThe summer months are all but gone, withered into a faded memory, like an old black and white photo. Lets hope that it was as enjoyable as it was productive. Its time to turn a new leaf in the chapter of life. New challenges, new faces, new subjects and more tests. So what did you do in the summer to keep motivated, or practice new habits?\n\nHere are my suggestions to staying motivated throughout the summer.\n* Read a new book/s.\n* Volunteer.\n* Apply the knowledge gained through the school year to a project that you wanted to do but never completed. * Research something you were interested...\n\nProof techniques are fun. They are mathematical arguments of sufficiency. The feeling you get from arguing your point logically to completion is always exhilarating. Let us put our mathematical reasoning power to the test. Now since this is our first of many proof techniques. I will start with something elementary.\n\n1. Prove the following:\n\n(a) Given that the average of y and z is odd, then z is an odd integer when y is odd.\n\nWhen doing proofs it is best to do so in algebraic and generalized form. A way to represent all possible cases. Using only examples would be trivial, since we know...\n\nStudents often ask me how do Mathematicians come up with various formulas in Trigonometry, Algebra and Calculus? By method of Proofs and Derivation I would exclaim, which in my opinion is becoming a lost art. I found deriving formulas helped to seal the understanding of the concepts and theories in Math. I believe it is thus fitting as an end to our talk on polynomials, to derive the equation of the quadratic formula. We will do so by using the last method we discussed, \"Completing the Square\".\n\nIt has been a while since my last post, but as promised I am back. Recently a reader of one of my blogs commented on how helpful they were in helping her explain a concept to her HS Junior. I was indeed very glad to hear. It certainly is an encouragement to see parents, not only sign their child up for tutoring but also willing to follow through the covered material as well. Expanding on the purpose of the blog page, would be a forum board where students/parents can post short questions and have tutor respond and perhaps even have their answers rated on helpfulness. This I believe would make...\n\nHorizontal Shifts:\nLet f be a function and c a positive real number.\n* The graph of y = f (x + c) is the graph of y = f (x) shifted to the left c\nunits.\n* The graph of y = f (x - c) is the graph of y = f (x) shifted to the right c units.\n\nReflection about the x-Axis:\n* The graph of y = - f (x) is the graph of y = f(x) reflected about the x-axis.\n\nA student got 50% of the questions on an algebra test correct. If he answered 10 out of the first 12 questions asked correctly but missed 3/4 of the remaining questions, how many questions were on the test?\n\nSo algebraically we need to setup an equation here. The sum of the 10 correctly answered questions and the remaining questions that were answered correctly divided by the total number of questions is 0.5. Let y represent the number of remaining questions answered correctly. Let x represent the number of questions in total. Then;\n\nWe have reviewing the six pillars of a good study habits, skills and strategies. Now I will talk about basic study techniques in assimilating the material. There are many self help books on how to study but to be honest the approach could vary based on the individuals learning abilities, the subject content at hand as well as the intent of the study session. There is no one size fits all approach. Studying is a discipline and as such, do start early, make a commitment at the beginning of the semester/the school year. Don't wait until it is too late and be overwhelmed with...\n\nThroughout the school year I have worked with several students from diverse economic and social backgrounds. In the sessions I had the chance to observe their study habits, their improvements and successes. From these observations I gathered some interesting and useful information that I believe will help others avoid the pitfalls of bad study habits, ill preparation and last minute cramming for tests/exams. These suggestions may be self evident but if followed will contribute to improvement in learning, retention, and finally the...\n\nToday I was working with a student preparing him for the upcoming SAT in June.

Most math instruction involves a lengthy discussion of the abstract theory behind the Math before instructing the student in how to solve problems. While there are some merits to this style, in the vast majority of the cases the student quickly gets bored and frustrated by the time he or she starts to solve the problems. This DVD, in contrast, teaches all of the concepts by working fully narrated problems step-by-step, which is a much more engaging way to learn.\n\nExceptional value and affordability. MathTutorDVD.com believes in providing value for our customers. This is a 11 Hour DVD course. We could have easily split this content into many DVD courses costing the same price but instead chose to keep the cost down so that this content is affordable to all.\n\nWhat is our teaching style like? All topics on this DVD are taught by working example problems. There are no traditional lectures of background material that won't help you solve problems and improve your skills. We believe in teaching-by-doing and that is what you will receive by watching this DVD. The Equations Of Motion are explained, for example, by working many problems in step-by-step detail. We begin with the easier problems and work our way up to the harder problems. The student immediately gains confidence, does not get bored, and quickly feels like he or she can conquer the material. This method is extremely powerful and has proven itself time and again. Perhaps most importantly, problem solving skills are honed early on that will help with homework and taking exams even after watching the very first lesson.",

The project is aimed at teachers, teacher trainers, researchers and the staff responsable for basic education, further education and development work - and consists of different parts:\n\nNämnaren the journal for mathematics education, publishes four issues annually. Plans are made for a fifth issue in English. In December 2000 a new book was published, \"Matematikk & undervisning, Norden 2000\". On the occasion of the World Mathematics Year, 2000, the editors for the Nordic journals have decided to publish a book about \"Mathematics education in the Nordic classroom. Year 2000\". Studies at different ages are described - from six-year-olds to trainee teachers. The purpose is to stimulate communication concerning the development of mathematics as a subject in the Scandinavian countries. The book has been forwarded to all subscribers of Nämnaren as a gift to mark the occasion of the World Mathematics Year 2000.\n\nNämnaren on the web inclusive of Nämnaren's data base, a searchable data base which can be located via the NCM web site. The data base contains an outline of approximately 2300 articles published since the start in 1974.\n\nNämnarenTEMA began with some smaller projects followed up by the National Agency for Education project for support and stimulance material for teachers (1993-95). The aim was to analyse the news, facilitate interpretation of the curriculum and evaluation, deal with the area of weaknesses in the field of Swedish mathematics education in compulsory and upper secondary schools documented in Swedish and international studies. The responsibility for this work was transferred in 1995 to the Nämnaren project. So far, four books have been published, and three more are in preparation. The series is a result of cooperation between researchers, teacher educators and teachers.\n\nThe Mathematics Biennial 2000 - Time For Mathematics One of the first assignments of the NCM was to organise and implement the 11th mathematics biennial in Göteborg 27-29 January, 2000 - up to now the biggest biennial. 280 lecturers provided 334 programme points for 5000 participants. Three students were invited from every teacher training area; in return they brought exhibition materials about their own education. Special seminars were built into the programme for the exchange of experiences between 170 students from different universities, and between students and the NCM. A Research conference for 130 participants in collaboration with the Swedish Association for Mathematics Education Research, SMDF and NCM started. International researchers from 16 different countries participated and took part later in the biennial. The documentation is produced by SMDF with support from NCM. Ten discussion groups with a total of 500 participants were initiated within chosen problem areas where the possibilities for improvement are considerable. The conference site on the NCM web site will be available. The discussions will hopefully lead to a mapping of the needs of competence development and development work within the respective areas.",

The course was actually designed\nwith\nfreshman math majors in mind, but, general-education students in it\nfound\nthat they could \"finally\" understand mathematics, so, when the word got\naround,\nthey became the majority of the audience.\n\nEquivalent courses: Probably no other text yields an\nequivalent course. At MSU the course number is Math 151. The level\nwould be about equivalent\nto a basic logic course -- but, it is only partly logic and, in The\nLanguage\nof Mathematics, the logic is illustrated by and selected for\nmathematics.\nThe course is more sophisticated (abstract) than Algebra II, but the\ncontent\nis not at all like \"College Algebra\" or \"Precalculus.\" Surprisingly,\nmany\nstudents who fail algebra in college (even remedial Algebra I) learn\nvery\nwell in this course if they are mature enough to actually do the\nreading\nand the work. It counts as a \"core\" course in mathematics at Montana\nState\nand Idaho State. It is somewhat above the level of \"Finite Math.\"",

    "text": "Math Anxiety\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMath anxiety has been defined as a feeling of tension and apprehension that arises when someone is faced with manipulating numbers and solving mathematical problems. It is not just associated with academic settings. It can show its ugly head in many ordinary life situations.\n\nIn academic settings, though, math anxiety can cause students to perform poorly on math tests, homework, and just in class generally. Very often, a studentís poor performance in a mathematics class is not just the result of a lack of knowledge. It can be tied to math anxiety as well. Someone with math anxiety is not mentally deficient. But, it can cause a student to lose focus and to lose confidence in mathematical situations, thus impacting future success in mathematical requirements.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nMath is linear in nature. In most classes it is possible to skip one chapter and still understand the other material covered. Not so with mathematics. In this discipline a student must learn and understand a process before moving on to the next one. In other words, what you learn in Chapter One is the foundation of what will be taught in Chapter Two.\n\nMath is like a language. It has many symbols that appear foreign until you really understand what each means. You canít expect to take Spanish, for example, one week and be fluent in it the next week. It is the same in mathematics. Practice makes perfect. Doing one or two homework problems is simply not enough practice to fully grasp the concepts covered in the chapter. Do all the problems assigned. Try doing a few of the ones not assigned, as well. You can be ďfluentĒ in math if you work at it.\n\nDonít expect your college math classes to mirror those you had in high school. In a secondary setting, you went to math class every day and were saturated with the materials covered that semester. In college, however, you are expected to learn the same amount of material but in a shorter amount of time with less contact, often, with your instructor. What you had a year to learn in high school will now be covered in about 14 -16 weeks, and you are expected to fully understand it before exiting the class.\n\nRemember, math requires a different mindset. In other classes you may just need to listen, take notes, and then learn the material without really applying what you learned. In math, you will be taking what you have learned and using it to solve equations or a set of problems.\n\nDonít despair! You can do mathematics. In fact, you probably use more math daily than you realize. Balanced a checkbook lately? Doubled a recipe? If math begins to get you down, come to the Learning Assistance Center and let the tutors get you back on track. You can succeed in your math classes!\n\nHow do I know that I have Math Anxiety?\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n1. Do I become anxious and forget important concepts during a math test?\n\n2. Do I blame the instructor if I donít do well on math assignments and tests?\n\n3. Do I stop taking notes in class when I get confused?\n\n4. Am I afraid to ask questions in math class?\n\n5. Do I stop working a problem as soon as I get stuck?\n\n6. Do I feel like it is impossible for me to understand math?\n\nIf you answered ďyesĒ to several of them, then you probably do suffer from Math Anxiety.\n\nStrategies for reducing math anxiety:\n\n1. Go to every math class, without fail.\n\n2. If you must miss a class, ask the instructor if you can attend another section so you can keep up with the work.\n\n3. Make sure you read the text carefully. Donít skip over the explanations. They are there for a reason.\n\n4. Try making a vocabulary list or an outline of the material in the chapter. Math does have its own vocabulary, and you need to be familiar with it.\n\n5. Get tutoring as soon as you recognize a problem.\n\n6. Always ask your instructor if you have a question about your assignment.\n\n7. Copy everything on the board. Repeat the steps mentally and try to work the problem. Make note cards with the steps to remind yourself of the process to solve problems.\n\n8. Study as soon as possible after your class. If you wait too long, you will forget what was covered in class. Try to make consistent study times at a point during the day when you are alert and focused. Have a set start and stop time and stick to it.\n\n9. Find a place that is relatively free of distractions and make that your consistent place to study.\n\n10. Turn off the phone, TV, and music while you study. It does make a difference.\n\n11. Form a study group from your classmates. Make sure you choose students who are motivated and disciplined so you can support each other.\n\n12. Donít study for extended periods. Take a break every 30 minutes or so.\n\n13. If you are frustrated with a concept, stop. Get up. Get some fresh air. Come back to it in a few minutes when your mind is clear.\n\n14. Watch the video tapes that accompany your text. You can find them in the LAC and in the library.\n\n15. Do some math work every day.\n\n16. Review your notes and homework before you go into class. That will give you a reference point when the instructor begins the lecture for that class session.",

Great Question! takes the content from each Study Tip from the previous edition and presents it in the context of a student question. Answers to the questions offer suggestions for problem solving, point out common errors to avoid, and provide informal hints and suggestions.\n\nNEW! Achieving Success boxes offer strategies for success in math courses, along with suggestions to help developmental students achieve their full academic potential.\n\nNEW! TheLearning Guide helps students learn how to make the most of their textbook and its companion learning tools, including MyMathLab. Organized by the textbook's learning objectives, this workbook provides additional practice for each section and guidance for test preparation. Published in an unbound, binder-ready format, the Learning Guide can serve as the foundation as the student's course notebook.\n\nExtensive exercise sets offer several types of exercises. This variety makes it easy to create well-rounded homework assignments from the text or in MyMathLab. Exercise types include the following:\n\nNEW! Concept and Vocabulary Checks provide fill-in-the-blank and true/false exercises that assess students' understanding of the definitions and concepts presented in the section. These are also assignable in MyMathLab.\n\nPractice Plus Problems are more challenging exercises that require students to combine several skills or concepts.\n\nWriting in Mathematics exercises ask students to explain terms and concepts in their own words, helping them to develop a mathematical vocabulary.\n\nCritical Thinking Exercises stretch student thinking by taking concepts one step further while asking students to draw conclusions and justify answers. Make Sense and True/False exercises also fall under this category.\n\nPreview Exercises help students prepare for the following section by previewing the concepts that they will soon encounter.\n\nMid-Chapter Check Points allow students to stop and assess the skills and concepts they've learned separately over several sections. The Mid-Chapter Check Points will now be available as a pre-made assignment in the Blitzer MyMathLab courses.\n\nCheck Point exercises after every example make the text more interactive by offering students the opportunity to test their understanding of the example by working a similar exercise. Answers to all of the Check Points are in the answer section.\n\nChapter Summaries are organized by section and highlight important concepts and topics with side-by-side examples to make it easy for students to study and check for mastery of important chapter content.\n\nAuthor\n\nBob Blitzer is a native of Manhattan and received a Bachelor of Arts degree with dual majors in mathematics and psychology (minor: English literature) from the City College of New York. His unusual combination of academic interests led him toward a Master of Arts in mathematics from the University of Miami and a doctorate in behavioral sciences from Nova University. Bob's love for teaching mathematics was nourished for nearly 30 years at Miami Dade College, where he received numerous teaching awards, including Innovator of the Year from the League for Innovations in the Community College and an endowed chair based on excellence in the classroom. In addition to his Developmental Algebra Series, Bob has written textbooks covering college algebra, algebra and trigonometry, precalculus, and liberal arts mathematics, all published by Pearson Education. When not secluded in his Northern California writer's cabin, Bob can be found hiking the beaches and trails of Point Reyes National Seashore, and tending to the chores required by his beloved entourage of horses, chickens, and irritable roosters.",

    "text": "The Basics of Algebra\n\nBefore you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1. Without understanding the distributive property, you will find yourself completely lost in a lot of common situations that come up. The distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nExponents – Just like multiplication is repeated addition, exponents allow us to use a shorthand for repeated multiplication.\n\nPercentages – Having an even ground for comparison between different amounts is a critical skill.",

    "text": "In the words of the author: Before writing my algebra series, it was painfully apparent that my students couldn't relate to the applications in the course. I was plagued with the question, \"What is this good for?\" To try to bridge that gap, I wrote some labs, which facilitated my students in collecting data, finding models via curve fitting, and using the models to make estimates and predictions. My students really loved working with the current, compelling, and authentic data and experiencing how mathematics truly is useful. My students' response was so strong that I decided to write an algebra series. Little did I know that to realize this goal, I would need to embark on a 15-year challenging journey, but the rewards of hearing such excitement from students and faculty across the country has made it all worthwhile! I'm proud to have played even a small role in raising peoples' respect and enthusiasm for mathematics. I have tried to honor my inspiration: by working with authentic data, students can experience the power of mathematics. A random-sample study at my college suggests that I am achieving this goal. The study concludes that students who used my series were more likely to feel that mathematics would be useful in their lives (P-value 0.0061) as well as their careers (P-value 0.024). In addition to curve fitting, my approach includes other types of meaningful modeling, directed-discovery explorations, conceptual questions, and of course, a large bank of skill problems. The curve-fitting applications serve as a portal for students to see the usefulness of mathematics so that they become fully engaged in the class. Once involved, they are more receptive to all aspects of the course.",

    "text": "Undergraduate linear algebra is both beautiful and replete with real world applications and connections to the rest of mathematics. The purpose of the present volume is to enrich the understanding of linear algebra for a wide audience by placing a broad collection of short items in the hands of teachers, students, and others who enjoy the subject. Because undergraduate linear algebra is so fundamental to the mathematics curriculum, it is often taught by non-specialists and specialists alike. \"Linear Algebra Gems\" offers to all teachers clever ways in which core ideas can be presented to their students.\n\nMost articles are accessible to those with modest preparation in linear algebra, including beginning students. However, many items will also contain pleasant surprises even to those well-versed in the subject. The editors have combed through the literature, and have selected from original submissions, to find expository articles and problems to enrich the reader's understanding. The seventy-three articles selected are organized into nine sections, with over 120 problems grouped into subject categories as a tenth section.\n\nContributors to the volume include experts in the field and long-time teachers of linear algebra. The book was prepared as part of a broad contract with the National Science Foundation to improve undergraduate linear algebra education. The editors hope that many readers will find enjoyment from this collection. [via]\n\nMore editions of Linear Algebra Gems: Assets for Undergraduate Mathematics:\n\nLinear algebra and matrix theory have long been fundamental tools in mathematical disciplines as well as fertile fields for research. In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. The book should be welcomed by graduate students and researchers in a variety of mathematical fields both as an advanced text and as a modern reference work. [via]",

Newman\n(ed.), The World of\nMathematics, New\nYork: Simon and\nSchuster, 1956.\n\nThe Unique Effects of Including History in College Algebra\n\nThe Modules (2)\n\nIntroduction to Polynomials: Looks at the efforts put forth in finding zeros of polynomials and includes a brief introduction to the lives of Niels Henrik Abel and Evariste Galois. This historical module excerpt illustrates the difficulties Abel and Galois had in breaking into the mathematical circles of their time. \"Niels Henrik Abel, at the age of sixteen, proved that a general formula for solving a quintic (fifth degree) polynomial did not exist…. However, since he was largely self taught, leading mathematicians in Paris, such as Cauchy, largely ignored him… Evariste Galois had equally important discoveries. At sixteen, Galois had the desire to enter the most prestigious engineering school of the day, the École Polytechnique… [W]hen Galois submitted a paper to the school as part of the admission process, Cauchy lost the paper. He attended another school for the purpose of training to become a teacher. However, he kept his mathematical studies up and submitted a second paper to the École Polytechnique. This paper also appears to have been lost.\" (Hagerty and Smith, 2006).\n\nPolynomials: Looks at theoretical methods to help find zeros of polynomials. The module looks at Horner's method and how information traveled in eras prior to modern-day technology. It includes a discussion of the difficulty of crediting the correct civilization with the development of a topic as it is believed that Horner did not develop the method credited to him; in fact, the Ancient Chinese knew of this method (Eves, 1992).\n\nTechnology: Looks at methods to use technology to find zeros of polynomials, and discusses the rapid changes in technology. The goal is to have the students take a look at when the Internet was developed and realize that instant messages were not always possible. The students need to realize that their parents enjoyed \"Pong\" and \"Pacman\" and their grandparents had the radio. Thus, the students need to revaluate the question \"My parents didn't need math, why do I?\"",

The...\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER I. LINEAR SPACE\n\nIn the euclidean plane E, we choose a fixed point 0 as the origin,\nand consider the set X of arrows or vectors in E with the common\ninitial point 0. A vector a in E with initial point 0 and endpoint A is\nby definition the ordered pair (O, A ) of points. The vector a = ( 0, A)\ncan be regarded as a graphical representation of a force acting at the...\n\nCHAPTER II. LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nAt the beginning of the last chapter, we gave a brief description of\nabstract algebra as the mathematical theory of algebraic systems and,\nin particular, linear algebra as the mathematical theory of linear\nspaces. These descriptions are incomplete, for we naturally want to\nfind relations among the algebraic systems in question. In other...\n\nCHAPTER III. AFFINE GEOMETRY\n\nTo define the basic notions of geometry, we can follow the so\ncalled synthetic approach by postulating geometric objects (e.g.\npoints, lines and planes) and geometric relations (e.g. incidence and\nbetweenness) as primitive undefined concepts and proceed to build\nup the geometry from a number of axioms which are postulated to...\n\nCHAPTER IV. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY\n\nIn order to have a concise theory without all these awkward exceptions,\nwe can - and this is a crucial step towards projective\ngeometry - extend the plane A (and similarly the plane A') by the\nadjunction of a set of new points called points at infinity. More\nprecisely, we understand by a point at infinity of A the direction...\n\nCHAPTER V. MATRICES\n\nThis therefore suggests the notion of a matrix as a doubly indexed\nfamily of scalars. Matrices are one of the most important tools in the\nstudy of linear transformations on finite-dimensional linear spaces.\nHowever, we need not overestimate their importance in the theory of\nlinear algebra since the matrices play for the linear transformations...\n\nCHAPTER VI. MULTILINEAR FORMS\n\nLinear transformations studied in Chapter II are, by definition,\nvector-valued functions of one vector variable satisfying a certain\nalgebraic requirement called linearity. When we try to impose similar\nconditions on vector-valued functions of two (or more) vector\nvariables, two different points of view are open to us. To be...\n\nCHAPTER VII. EIGENVALUES\n\nGiven a single endomorphism o of a finite-dimensional linear\nspace X, it is desirable to have a base of X relative to which the\nmatrix of o takes up a form as simple as possible. We shall see in this\nchapter that some endomorphisms can be represented (relative to\ncertain bases) by matrices of diagonal form; while for every...\n\nCHAPTER VIII. INNER PRODUCT SPACES\n\nWe began in Chapter I by considering certain properties of vectors\nin the ordinary plane.

When specifying the size of a matrix, the number of rows is stated first. For example, here is a 2 by 4 real matrix:\n\nThe numbers in a matrix are called entries, and are specified by the row and then column in which they appear. In the example above, for instance, A1,2 is the entry in the first row and second column, i.e. 4.98. Two matrices of the same size (with the same number of rows and columns) can be added componentwise, that is (A + B)i, j = Ai, j + Bi, j. Matrix multiplication is a little more complicated. A matrix M can be multiplied on the right by another matrix T only if T has the same number of rows as M has columns, and the result will have as many rows as M and as many columns as T. The entry of M T appearing in row i and column j is the sum of the pairwise products of the entries in row i of M and column j of T. In other words, if M is an n by m matrix, T must be an m by l matrix, and\n\nNotice that this operation is not, in general, commutative. A matrix that has the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix, and these are particularly interesting as they can be added and multiplied, and the results will have the same dimensions. The most standard use of matrices is to represent linear operators, but they have a wide variety of other uses, and are interesting to study in their own right. Matrices can have a large number of different types of entries, including various kinds of numbers, elements of abstract fields and other algebraic structures, functions, and so forth.\nmonotone function\nAlso called monotonic function.

Well, applied maths is basically engineering, computer science, actuarial studies, etc. which are specialized fields and more suitable to be studied at university. If you teach applied maths to student, they won't have the skills to do the problems. I believe that maths at school should be pure maths with an emphasis on rigor, problem solving and understanding so students can make use of the maths in university.\n\nSign in to YouTube\n\nUm,.. Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, both people that were only able to ASK QUESTIONS in mathematics due to their deep understanding in maths. Thus deep understanding was only caused by learning maths.

The book focuses on fundamental mathematical concepts and realistic problem-solving via mathematical modeling rather than the development of algebraic skills.\n\nFunctions, Data and Models presents college algebra in a way that differs from almost all college algebra books available today. The authors teach something new rather than covering the same ground as high school courses. By changing the content of the course, the authors are able to give students an introduction to data analysis and mathematical modeling that even students with limited algebraic skills can handle. The book contains rich exercises, many of which use real data. Also included are thought experiments or what if questions that are meant to stretch the student's mathematical thinking.",

    "text": "Calculus ABCs:\n\nAbsolutely Basic Competency\n\nIntroduction\n\nFreshman Calculus covers a wide range of topics. As students struggle to\nlearn concepts, techniques, and applications, it is possible for certain basic\nskills to get lost in the shuffle. To ensure that students who pass freshman\ncalculus can do the basics, the Department of Mathematics has identified\nstandards for \"Absolutely Basic Competency\"--what we call the Calculus\nABCs. There are separate standards for MA131 and MA132, covering only\nprerequisite material (see below). In both of these courses, students must\ndemonstrate mastery of these basic skills in order to receive a grade of C or\nbetter.\n\nRequirement\n\nPassing a Calculus ABCs Test is a minimum requirement for getting a\ngrade of C or better in the course: passing means you may earn any grade (A\nto F) in the course (based on other coursework), while not passing means you\nmay earn no higher than a D+ (regardless of other coursework). This\nrequirement is part of MA131 and MA132 each semester they are taught, and also\napplies to placement tests for those courses administered at Clarkson.\nA passing score is 90% or better; all problems are graded right/wrong\n(essentially no partial credit). ABCs tests will be offered as needed during\nthe first half of the semester. Each student may take up to five tests in\norder to pass; if needed, they may take one last ABCs test during final exam\nweek (in addition to the regular course final exam).\n\nAdvice\n\nTake the test seriously--for many students this is a real challenge.\nPractice using the sample tests (see below) and learn the\nmaterial solidly before taking the test.\nDo not just show up and hope to pass by luck (you won't)--the only way\nto succeed here is to master the material.\nYou should also read the Instructions for Grading\nbefore taking the test, so you will know for sure what is expected.",

    "text": "About 2.0\n\nCK-12 Foundation introduces its version 2.0 which provides the component missing in version 1.0 – a focus around learning. At CK-12, we believe that learning is an individual activity requiring many things – multiple modalities, interactions with other human beings (such as teachers, peers, and parents) as well as collaborations. Hence, in this version of the system we combine student-centric learning with teacher-centric tools and materials to create a dynamic system that can be used by anyone. Our belief is that this will help in reducing \"gaps\" and provide the ability to fill these gaps.\n\nUsers will continue to find high quality, national and international standards aligned content in K-12 Science and Math subjects. As before, that content can be used to create customized books or courses. New to the system are concepts, smaller chunks of content that can be used to learn or review specific topics. The concepts are supported with many associated modalities as well as interactive and automated exercises and assessments allowing for students to see where they are and how they are progressing. Interactive learning objects as well as simulations from entities such as Wolfram will support these concepts. In addition, we will be providing a guiding system allowing students to learn at their own pace with purpose. This navigational system at the same time, will allow for teachers to mentor their students.\n\nVersion 2 of CK-12′s system is the next step toward the foundation's mission to increase the access of high quality educational materials for all. Important features include:\n\nHigh quality, standards-aligned content for science and math presented at the book and now concept levels. (Concepts can be combined to form chapters and books.) The previous format of book and chapter will still be available.\n\nA \"Concept Map\" to show the interrelation of concepts, providing a guided path of learning for those who are interested.\n\nAs always, the ability to edit and customize, both at the concept and book level.",

    "text": "Bringing a new vitality to college mathematics\n\nLet's talk variables. Do we want students to develop an understanding of variable concepts (whether in a developmental math course or not)? Is accurate use of variable notation enough? If students can model applications and accurately determine solutions … is that enough? Is there a role for linguistic literacy in mathematics?\n\nOne of the issues we face in college is dealing (or not) with prior learning. Without intervention, prior learning (even when inaccurate) survives — often surviving in the face of conflicting information in the current learning environment. Visualize the prior learning as being as a stable mass of 'knowledge' (even though it has gaps and errors); as students go through a class as adults, information that connects positively with the old reinforces the old. When new information does not connect or conflicts with the old, the low-energy (natural) response is to build new storage … resulting in that solid core being supplemented by weak veneers of new knowledge. This, of course, is an incomplete visualization for the actual processes in the human brain. The suggestion is that students approach a math class with an attitude that supports old information and minimizes cognitive effort for dealing with new or incompatible information.\n\nIn my beginning algebra class this week, we did the test on exponents and polynomials. Although the test includes some artificially difficult problems with negative exponents, most of the items deal with important ideas. One of the most basic items on the test was this:\n\nEvaluate a² + (3b)² for a = -3 and b = 2\n\nSeveral students made this mistake with the first term:\n\n-3² = -9\n\nA smaller group of students made this mistake with the second term:\n\n(32)²\n\nNow, this is a good class — all students are actually doing homework and attending class almost every day. We had dealt with the first situation at the start of the semester. How could these errors survive to this point?\n\nBoth errors are based on variable as a symbol to be replaced by a number, which is not complete. They might represent a visual approach, not verbal. Variables represent quantities involved in sums and products, where products with variables are implied … and more than this. Simplifying expressions might — or might not — uncover the incomplete understanding. What can I do to help students with this?\n\nI am planning on incorporating some linguistic activities around variables in the first week of the semester. Some of the ideas are from a old book called \"English Skills for Algebra\" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print. The authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students. Some of their activities involve listening to somebody read mathematical statements and the student writing them down. I think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).\n\nI do know that just saying \"that was wrong … this is right\" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding. I need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables. Some energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together. Without that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.\n\nShare this:\n\n5 Comments\n\n(1) The concept of \"variable\" is a means towards an end. It should thus not be surprising that to \"teach an understanding of variable\" does not work. It cannot.\n\nIn a developmental context, the obvious end is the discussion of function: we need a paper representation for what we input.\n\nThus, my attempt in could not work because, as I eventually realized and mentioned in, I should have had—and will have real soon now—a \"Chapter 3 – Functions\".\n\n(2) The usual definition of powers does not work very well in the remedial situation. For something that works, see freemathtexts.org\n\nThus, 5(3b)^2 should be read as \"5 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 5•3b•3b, and the default rule \"when there is no coefficient, it goes without saying that it is 1″ lets us read (3b)^2 as \"1 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 1•3b•3b.\n\n(3) Re \"linguistic activities\", what is very likely to work is having the mathematics text used as the reading material in a remedial English reading course. Of course, the text cannot be the usual prescriptive stuff (that takes students for idiots) but one that has faith in the ability of the students to be receptive to arguments.\n\nGranted, writing this kind of text is not easy.\n\nIn order to see what I mean, one might want to look up my own attempts which can be found at freemathtexts.org and freemathtexts.org",

    "text": "WHAT DOES A MATHEMATICS MAJOR STUDY?\n\nMathematics is one of the fundamental areas of human knowledge. It has held an established position among the humanities for over two thousand years, and in recent centuries it has played a vital role in the sciences. The body of mathematical knowledge is growing today faster than ever before, with old questions being answered and new ones asked at an unprecedented rate.\n\nIn the paragraphs below, we sketch some of the courses and topics which mathematics majors study at Wright State University. In each case, the illustrations of what students learn are only small samples of the full curriculum.\n\nMathematics majors typically begin their college mathematics studies with three semesters of Calculus. Calculus is both the cornerstone of \"analysis,\" one of the major branches of pure mathematics, and an indispensable tool for most of the sciences and engineering. Students learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right. Students study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.\n\nAll mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year. This basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, \"algebra\" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications. In linear algebra, the study of linear equations, like those in beginning high school algebra -- but with the possibility of thousands of equations in thousands of unknowns -- leads to abstract mathematical spaces.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a variety of more advanced courses. Students decide which of these to take according to their interests and the particular degree which they seek.\nFor example, students apply multivariable calculus in probability and the mathematical foundations of statistical inference in Theory of Statistics. Related choices include Statistical Methods and Introduction to Experimental Designs, in which one learns how to collect and analyze data, for instance in scientific and industrial experiments.\n\nSimilarly, students can choose mathematics courses with special significance in computer science. A prime example is Applied Graph Theory, featuring mathematical models and algorithms applicable to such problems as traffic systems, activity scheduling, and design layout. Others are Cryptography (how to encrypt data securely) and Coding Theory (how to send messages that self-correct transmission errors).\n\nOther courses in applied mathematics emphasize mathematical theory and problem solving methods directed toward the physical sciences and engineering. An illustrative example at the junior level is Partial Differential Equations involving several variables (e.g., both space and time). They describe such phenomena as the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space, and the flow of heat in solids.\n\nCourses in pure mathematics concentrate upon the theoretical foundations of algebra, calculus, and other elementary courses, and at the same time point the way toward more advanced topics in modern mathematics. To illustrate, students in Real Variables (or theoretical advanced calculus) learn why the facts and computational methods learned in ordinary calculus are correct; in Modern Algebra, students study various abstract systems which include the familiar objects of school mathematics as special cases (whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, etc.)\n\nIn addition to taking many courses in the major field of study, every undergraduate at Wright State University is required to take a comprehensive program of General Education studies, including courses in history, English, economics, the sciences, and several other disciplines. Moreover, some degree programs allow students to take \"free electives,\" or courses chosen by students from essentially any area. Wright State's degree programs in mathematics have a generous allotment of these free electives.",

It was good for additional exercises and additional persepctive from my main course book (the Gaulter and Gaulter one) but it was pretty old, at least the edition I was using was. Someone will correct me if I'm mistaken, but I think my teacher mentioned it was the book she used in the 1980s for her A-levels so you may find it's a bit old fashioned in the approach.\n\nIt's true that these books are very old but we still use them with our students doing Maths and especially Further Maths on the CIE syllabus.\n\nThe problem is not so much old fashioned-ness in style, but that they don't match to your syllabus. The red book probably covers the A-level more or less completely, but the stuff you need is mixed up with stuff you don't, so it's a bit inconvenient. The yellow book may or may not cover all of your Further syllabus, and it will definitely have stuff you don't need (unless you're doing STEP, and even then you might not need groups), and it might be missing very important parts (e.g. in CIE we do vector spaces, and it's lacking in that area).\n\nThey have a lot of detail and a lot of good, challenging questions - they'll be a good supplementary text for higher achieving students.\n\n(Original post by isp-)\nMaths:\n\n[ Further Maths:",

    "text": "fartherThis book is about how to solve difficult real problems by an easy method that uses the dimensions of the problem to derive an answer. Dimensions are things like inches, feet, seconds, and so on that are used to set up the answer to a problem usually described in words. How many meters in a mile? How many seconds in a year? How fast is a car going if it accelerates for ten miles per hour every second for 20 seconds? How far has it traveled? How high is an airplane if a wrench dropped from it takes 30 seconds to hit the ground? How many moles of water in 12 pounds? How much money can be saved by insulating a house?\n\nThese and practically all problems that have a dimension can be solved by the methods shown in this book.\n\nThe author strongly believes that this method should be taught in all high schools. He believes that 9th grade would be the best starting time and at the beginning of the year. He has called this method Dimensional Analysis. Students would only require two weeks to become proficient.\n\nMr. Kelly taught three 8th grade classes how to use Dimensional Analysis in only three days. The response by the science teacher and students was strongly positive.\n\nIt became clear however that reinforcement of the technique was needed.

Based on lectures he gave at the University of Michigan in the early 1960s, this book is concerned with the use of analytic methods in the study of integer solutions to Diophantine equations and Diophantine inequalities. It provides an excellent introduction to a timeless area of number theory that is still as widely researched today as it was when the book originally appeared. The three main themes of the book are Waring's problem and the representation of integers by diagonal forms, the solubility in integers of systems of forms in many variables, and the solubility in integers of diagonal inequalities.

In this way, the text communicates to students, the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, helping to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. The authors included in this edition, Problem-Recognition exercises, that many instructors will likely identify to be similar to worksheets they have personally developed for distribution to students. The intent of the Problem-Recognition exercises, is to help students overcome what is sometimes a natural inclination toward applying problem-sovling algorithms that may not always be appropriate. In addition, the exercise sets have been revised to include even more core exercises than were present in the first edition. This permits instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills and develop the knowledge they need to make a successful transition into College Algebra. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class, as they do inside class with their instructor.

These topics\nunderlie most areas of modern mathematics, and recur regularly in years\n2, 3, and 4. The logical content of the material is more sophisticated\nthan that of many A-level courses, and the aim of the lectures is to\nenhance students' understanding and enjoyment by providing a sequence of\ninteresting short-term goals, and encouraging class participation.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this unit successful students will be able to:\n\nanalyze statements using truth tables;\n\nconstruct simple proofs including proofs by contradiction and proofs by induction;\n\nprove statements about sets and functions;\n\nprove standard results about countable sets;\n\napply Euclid's Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of pairs of integers and to solve linear Diophantine equations;\n\nto solve simultaneous linear congruences;\n\nmultiply and factorize permutations;\n\nprove the infinitude of prime numbers, prove Fermat's Little Theorem and use it to find modular inverses and to solve linear congruences;\n\nconstruct multiplication tables for congruence classes, reduced congruence classes and sets of permutations. Have an informal understanding of isomorphisms between the groups seen in the course.\n\nFuture topics requiring this course unit\n\nAlmost all Mathematics course units, particularly those in pure mathematics.\n\nAssessment\n\nArrangements\n\nMidterm Test\n\nThe Midterm Test will be in-class and closed book, and will relate\nto the first five weeks of the course ONLY. It will involve\nanswering questions similar to those on the relevant Problem Sheets;\nstudents who have taken full advantage of their supervision classes\nshould therefore find the Test straightforward. It will be worth\n15% of the final mark for the course. Answers will be marked\nand returned in due course, as part of the learning process.",

The study version added exercises and other classroom aids. This softcover edition includes new epilogues by the original authors.\nTop page\n\nComplete description\n\nWinner of the 1983 National Book Award! \"...a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor...\" - The New Yorker (1983 National Book Award edition) Mathematics has been a human activity for thousands of years. Yet only a few people from the vast population of users are professional mathematicians, who create, teach, foster, and apply it in a variety of situations. The authors of this book believe that it should be possible for these professional mathematicians to explain to non-professionals what they do, what they say they are doing, and why the world should support them at it. They also believe that mathematics should be taught to non-mathematics majors in such a way as to instill an appreciation of the power and beauty of mathematics. Many people from around the world have told the authors that they have done precisely that with the first edition and they have encouraged publication of this revised edition complete with exercises for helping students to demonstrate their understanding.\nThis edition of the book should find a new generation of general readers and students who would like to know what mathematics is all about. It will prove invaluable as a course text for a general mathematics appreciation course, one in which the student can combine an appreciation for the esthetics with some satisfying and revealing applications. The text is ideal for 1) a GE course for Liberal Arts students 2) a Capstone course for perspective teachers 3) a writing course for mathematics teachers. A wealth of customizable online course materials for the book can be obtained from Elena Anne Marchisotto (elena.marchisotto@csun.edu) upon request.\nTop page\n\nGeneral info\n\nPublisher & Imprint:\nBirkhauser Boston Inc\n\nEdition details\n1st Reprint of the 1995 Edition ed. 2012.

    "text": "AO2: Relate tables, graphs, and equations to linear and simple quadratic relationships found in number and spatial patterns.\n\nWe have available a large range of activities that can be used for developing some basic concepts in algebra. Students often complain that they cannot see the point of learning algebra so all of the teaching of skills here is placed within contexts. The intention of this unit is not to teach skills in isolation, but rather to use each activity for developing all the concepts. It is not suggested that this unit should replace the skills practice traditionally used in the teaching of algebra. It does, however, provide the opportunities for discussion and development of concepts. As each learning outcome is explored there will probably be need for consolidation through more traditional exercises. With the first activities one will probably not wish to explore all aspects with the whole class, but the possibility is there for extending individuals. It would also be appropriate to use the first activity for diagnostic assessment.\n\nThe initial focus of this unit involves students in gathering data from their investigation of squares that can be made on different sized geoboards, (an array of dots arranged on a square grid). Students need to be systematic in their work, and to record their results in ways that are likely to help them notice patterns and relationships.\n\nTechniques for drawing linear graphs are introduced via whole number problem situations where the focus is on the solutions rather than the technique. Only linear equations of the form ax±by=c are graphed by finding two or more points on the line. No attempt is made to link these equations by algebra to the gradient intercept form y=mx+c.",

    "text": "A Journey in Algebraic Thinking\n\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that is teaching courses with names like Algebra I or Algebra II. The rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school. In the United States, some schools offer an alternative, such as an integrated program that incorporates algebra as a strand blended with geometry and other advanced topics. Others continue to offer a course sequence that includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. In an increasing number of states, the study of algebra in some form is required of all students for high school graduation. Regardless of whether a school's secondary curriculum includes a separate course in Algebra I or is more integrated, we can take concrete steps to ensure that students will flourish and succeed when they arrive at the formal study of algebra. A key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.\n\nAlgebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change. Of course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems. But trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure. Algebraic thinking can begin when students begin their study of mathematics.\n\nAt the earliest grades, young children work with patterns. At an early age, children have a natural love of mathematics, and their curiosity is a strong motivator as they try to describe and extend patterns of shapes, colors, sounds, and eventually letters and numbers. And at a young age, children can begin to make generalizations about patterns that seem to be the same or different. This kind of categorizing and generalizing is an important developmental step on the journey toward algebraic thinking.\n\nThroughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well. As students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3. As they explore and understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they can look for patterns that help them learn procedures and facts. Patterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense. Patterns within the multiplication table itself are interesting to children and help them both learn their facts and understand relationships among facts. The process of noticing and exploring patterns sets the stage for looking at more complex relationships, including proportionality, in later grades.\n\nAs students move into the middle grades, their mathematics experience can focus on connecting their work with numbers and operations to more symbolic work with equations and expressions. At this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum. This concept should take students well beyond the study of ratios, proportions, and percent. A real understanding of proportionality allows students to connect their experience with numbers and operations to ideas that they have studied in geometry, measurement, and data analysis. They begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.\n\nA solid understanding of proportionality sets the stage for students to succeed in the more formal study of algebra. From this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally. As students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them. Looking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.\n\nThe journey doesn't end with a student's first formal study of algebra at high school. Continuous development of increasingly sophisticated algebraic reasoning can provide an avenue into the study of geometry and advanced mathematics. In the world outside school, these topics are not separated. When higher-level courses regularly incorporate opportunities to build on students' algebraic understanding, students are far more likely to succeed than if the courses present just one mathematical perspective.\n\nThe development of algebraic thinking is a process, not an event. It is something that can be part of a positive, motivating, enriching school mathematics experience. \"Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School\" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year. Watch for opportunities to develop your own understanding of this important topic throughout the year, including as part of conferences, journals, publications, and the NCTM Web site.\n\nFor this month's questions, consider the following: How can we build algebraic thinking into the pre-K–12 curriculum at all levels? How should secondary school mathematics be organized to capitalize on the inclusion of algebraic thinking throughout the elementary and middle grades? What can NCTM do to support teachers in fostering the development of algebraic thinking?",

But unlike in other applications, the buttons in My Calcul can be programmed by you to do exactly the calculations you want. You are free to set the name of each function button and the calculation formula behind it.\n\nThe calculation formula behind each button can take several named variables and an unlimited number of parenthesis. In the case of function ft-in>cm, the formula has 2 variables named inches and feet :\n\nMain features of My Calcul :\n\n* the calculation formulae can have up to 255 characters, with an unlimited number of parenthesis and named variables. The last value of each variable is memorized within one session, and it is offered as default value when the same variable is used again, in the same formula or in another formula.\n* the following functions are recognized in formulae: log, ln, factorial, sin, cos, tan, acos, asin, atan, cosh, sinh, acosh, asinh. The numbers pi and e are also recognized.\n* the calculator can operate in standard algebraic mode or in RPN mode (Reverse Polish Notation).\n\nMy Calcul features an equation solver module. When the user loads an equation with n variables (up to 6), the application automatically builds up a table with one line per variable. The table can be used like a small spreadsheet where the user enters values for any sub-set of n-1 variables and let the application calculate the value of the nth variable to solve the equation. Each cell in this special kind of spreadsheet is both an input cell and a calculated cell. This is very useful for all sorts of \"what if\" type calculations.",

This view is at the center of the teaching and learning of mathematics at Cistercian. Every departmental course at Cistercian seeks to engage our students in both formal and informal modes of mathematical reasoning. The journey from arithmetic to calculus begins with Cistercian's Middle School mathematics curriculum. The focus here is first on developing the students' understanding of rational arithmetic and basic geometry. The second two years of the Middle School are considered together as serving the purpose of introducing algebra into the treatment of both arithmetic and geometry.\n\nMathematics in the Upper School begins with Euclid's geometry. Students need to learn geometry, not only because it is indispensable for all of applied mathematics, engineering, architecture, physics, and calculus, but even more importantly because it has simply speaking set the standard that any piece of reasoning must meet to be called a branch of mathematics. Forms VI and VII are a continuation of the earlier forms but the weaving of geometry and algebra is now more complete. Cistercian's mathematics curriculum culminates in Form VIII with a yearlong calculus course taught at the college level with a selection of material which also allows willing students to take the Advanced Placement exams in calculus.\n\nAt the same time, topics from discrete mathematics such as counting and probability are important and are included in each required course. Moreover, students wishing to delve deeper into these topics can take advantage of various mathematics electives in the Upper School as well as join Cistercian's Math Club or one of our many math teams.\n\nDepartment Faculty:\n\nDr. Richard T.

    "text": "Secondary Curricula\n\nStudent Textbook Set\n\nWhen a school implements Carnegie Learning textbooks, each student receives a consumable textbook set that contains the following books.\n\nStudent Textbook\n\nThe Student Text is a consumable textbook designed for students to take notes and work problems directly in each lesson. Each lesson contains objectives, key terms, and problems that help the students to discover and master mathematical concepts.\n\nStudent Assignments and Skills Practice\n\nThe Student Assignments book contains one assignment per lesson and skills practice activities. It is designed to move with the student from classroom to home to lab time so that students can repeatedly practice the skills taught in the lesson.\n\nHomework Helper*\n\nThe Homework Helper book is designed to help parents and care givers be more informed about the concepts being covered in the student's math course. Students are encouraged to keep the Homework Helper at home. It contains one activity per lesson including examples of the skills taught in the lesson and several practice problems. Answers to the practice problems are provided in the back of the Homework Helper book.\n\n*Homework Helper included in Bridge to Algebra and Algebra I curricula.\n\nWhat Makes Carnegie Learning Student Texts Engaging?\n\nLearning By Doing Principles\n\nCarnegie Learning believes that students develop math understanding and skills by taking an active role and responsibility for their own learning. With Carnegie Learning textbooks students become engaged in solving contextual math problems that strengthen their conceptual understanding of math topics. Rather than encouraging students to memorize procedures, we provide them opportunities to think and work together in small groups.\n\nReal-World Context\n\nStudents work with their peers to solve real-world problem situations like using percents for leaving a tip in a restaurant or using a graph of an equation to determine the number of days it will take to build miles of highway. They become more engaged in learning mathematics when they see how it plays a significant role in everyday life.\n\nMathematical Discourse\n\nThroughout the student text icons prompt different forms of student communication. These icons may instruct students to work independently, work with groups, or share ideas with the class. Encouraging mathematical discourse provides opportunities for students to explain their thoughts and processes for solving math problems.\n\nCarnegie Learning Textbooks\n\nDocuments & Brochures\n\n2012 Program Guide (Middle & High School)Explore our Middle School and High School Math Series featuring our innovative, research-based software and textbooks for students in grades 6-12, and Professional Development for educators of Grades K-12.",

    "text": "The four graphing modes provide a structure of the four sections of the book:\n\nUsing function graphing\n\nYou may well be familiar with the basics of this type of graph drawing but, unless you have spent many hours using your calculator in conjunction with its operating manual, you will undoubtedly find that there are graphing techniques in this section that are new to you and that are interesting and fun.\n\nUsing polar graphing\n\nUnits 4 and 5 form a short section involving the use of polar graphing. Polar coordinates are explained and you are shown how to produce spirals and other interesting shapes like the heart-shaped one shown here. This section could be studied independently of the rest of the book.\n\nUsing parametric graphing\n\nAfter an introduction to this graphing mode in Unit 6, the next two units deal with applications in mechanics, and Units 9 and 10 with applications in pure mathematics. Each pair of units could be studied independently.\n\nUsing sequence graphing Unit 11 provides an introduction to iterative methods of defining sequences in general and the next four units cover time-sequence graphs, staircase and cobweb diagrams and phase plots. Units 11 to 16 are best worked through in order.\n\nThe DfEE in England and Wales published the Key Stage 3 National Strategy, Framework for teaching mathematics: Years 7, 8 and 9. Central to the Framework is the appropriate use of technology, particularly graphics calculators.\n\nThis book provides 30 lesson plans, each consisting of a page of teacher notes and one or more student handouts. These are written specifically for the Texas Instruments TI-83 or TI-83 Plus calculators. The teacher notes reflect the lesson structure suggested in the Framework: Starter à Main activity à Plenary session.\n\nAlso in the teacher notes is a section containing all the information needed to link the lesson to the National Strategy Framework document.\n\nWhat calculator skills are needed? The lesson outlines assume a very basic level of competence with the calculator, particularly for the teacher. In every lesson there is reference to the teacher using a view-screen calculator as a sort of electronic blackboard for full-class teaching. Teachers who are not confident users of the calculator will find that a copy of Calculator Maths: Foundations Plus will help them acquire all the basic calculator skills that they will need for these 30 lessons. The other books in the Calculator Maths series are also a useful complement to this one, with lots more activities for use at Key Stages 3 and 4.\n\nThis new book is a companion to the very successful 30 Calculator Lessons. It has been written to motivate, challenge, entertain and enlighten students aged 11 to 16.\n\nThe new book provides another 30 plans for lessons, each consisting of a page of teacher notes and two more of student handouts. Once again, these are written specifically for the Texas Instruments TI-83 or TI-83 Plus calculators.\n\nHowever, each of these lessons is based on a simple calculator program that students are encouraged to create for themselves.\n\nShort programs This is certainly not a book of clever and complicated programs for teachers to dazzle the class with!\n\nOn the contrary, these photocopiable worksheets, help pupils to create their own short programs and show how they can be gradually built up from the bare bones of a skeleton version to something more sophisticated.\n\nPrice: £30.00( )\n\nQuantity:\n\nAlgebra ThePrice: £8.95( )\n\nQuantity:\n\nShapeNumberHandling DataFoundations Plus The first book in a series of five, Foundations Plus covers all the basic calculator skills.

    "text": "This book is a first introduction to linear algebra for students majoring in scientific, engineering and social science disciplines. It stresses both practical computation and theoretical principles, and proceeds at a very leisurely pace. One of its characteristic features is that it deals with systems of linear equations at an early stage and uses this theory for the introduction of later techniques and for the proofs of most of the usual vector space theorems. Vector spaces are initially introduced in terms of ${\\bbfR}\\sp n$, a later chapter gives a more formal treatment. This results in a fair amount of repetition but enables one to choose between a more elementary or more advanced course. The authors have included sections on applications such as difference equations, differential equations, interpolation and least squares approximation, and each chapter includes extensive exercise sections. For the second edition much of the material has been extended and the layout of the text has been improved. There is a new section on linear transformations, and an instructor's manual and a student solutions manual are now available.\nReviewer:\nR.von Randow",

It is intended for students who (1) have no exposure to elementary algebra, (2) have previously had an unpleasant experience with elementary algebra, or (3) need to review algebraic concepts and techniques. In F.LE Equal Differences over Equal Intervals 2, students prove the property in general (for equal intervals of any length).\n\nIn this task students observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly, quadratically, or (more generally) as a polynomial function.\n\nIn this task students have the opportunity to construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).\n\nThis lesson is designed for students to gather and analyze data about baseball figures.

The\nquadratic equation:\n\na\nx² + b x + c = 0\n\ncan\nbe solved using a formula but most polynomial equations don't have\nformulas to give the solution. Every polynomial with only real or complex coefficients has a complex number solution, this is the fundamental theorem of algebra, but they cannot always be expressed exactly with radicals. To find an approximation to the solution we may have to use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or Laguerre method.\n\nGeneralised reciprocity laws are very\ncomplicated algorithms that enable you to get crucial information\nabout some of these more complicated equations. In favorable\ncircumstances, they can be used to prove deep statements about the\nsolution sets of algebraic equations.\n\nAn\nequation does not have to be too complicated to lack a formula, for\nexample:\n\nx5 - x + 1 = 0\n\nNumbers\n\n- Real\nnumbers - numbers which are continuous such as when we are representing points along a line - On this site I will sometimes use the term 'Scalar' to mean 'Real' numbers although strictly the term should be used when scaling a vector - In computer programs real numbers have a finite length and may have decimal point and/or exponent this allows us to approximate most real numbers but it is only an approximation.\n\nSet Definition\n\nFunction Definition\n\nA\nfunction from a set A to a set B is a rule that assigns to each\nelement in A an element of B. If f is the name of the function and a is an element of A then we write f(a) to mean the\nelement of B that is assigned to a. A function f is often written as f: A →B.\n\nWhere I can, I have put links to Amazon for books that are relevant to\nthe subject, click on the appropriate country flag to get more details\nof the book or to buy it from them.\n\nFearless Symmetry - This\nbook approaches symmetry from the point of view of number theory.

She obtained her teaching degrees, a bachelor's, master's, and doctorate--all in mathematics education--from the University of Central Florida. Together with her writing colleagues, Moch has endeavored to share that love with readers. MaryE Wilkinson received her B.S., master's, and doctorate in mathematics education from the University of Central Florida. She has taught high school mathematics courses, college mathematics courses, and mathematics and science methods courses. When thinking and writing about elementary school mathematics, she draws upon all of her experiences and continuing presence in elementary classrooms.\n\nDavid Rock is Professor of History at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

    "text": "Discrete Mathematics With Combinatorics\n\n9780130457912\n\nISBN:\n\n0130457914\n\nEdition: 2 Pub Date: 2003 Publisher: Prentice Hall PTR\n\nSummary: As in the first edition, the purpose of this book is to present an extensive range and depth of topics in discrete mathematics and also work in a theme on how to do proofs. Proofs are introduced in the first chapter and continue throughout the book. Most students taking discrete mathematics are mathematics and computer science majors. Although the necessity of learning to do proofs is obvious for mathematics majors,...it is also critical for computer science students to think logically. Essentially, a logical bug-free computer program is equivalent to a logical proof. Also, it is assumed in this book that it is easier to use (or at least not misuse) an application if one understands why it works. With few exceptions, the book is self-contained. Concepts are developed mathematically before they are seen in an applied context. Additions and alterations in the second edition: More coverage of proofs, especially in Chapter 1. Added computer science applications, such as a greedy algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph, a recursive algorithm for counting the number of nodes on a binary search tree, or an efficient algorithm for computinga b modnfor very large values ofa, b,andn. An extensive increase in the number of problems in the first eight chapters. More problems are included that involve proofs. Additional material is included on matrices. Inclusion of finite states with output and Turing machines. True-False questions at the end of each chapter. Summary questions at the end of each chapter. A glossary at the end of each chapter. Functions and sequences are introduced earlier (in Chapter 2). Calculus is not required for any of the material in this book. College algebra is adequate for the basic chapters. However, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than do the basic chapters, so calculus is recommended more for giving maturity, than for any direct uses. This book is intended for either a one- or two-term course in discrete mathematics. The first eight chapters of this book provide a foundation in discrete mathematics and would be appropriate for a first-level course for freshmen or sophomores. These chapters are essentially independent, so that the instructor can pick the material he/she wishes to cover. The remainder of the book contains appropriate material for a second course in discrete mathematics. These chapters expand concepts introduced earlier and introduce numerous advanced topics. Topics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings. The range of topics include: Logic--Including truth tables, propositional logic, predicate calculus, circuits, induction, and proofs. Set Theory--Including cardinality of sets, relations, partially ordered sets, congruence relations, graphs, directed graphs, and functions. Algorithms--Including complexity of algorithms, search and sort algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm, Huffman's algorithm, Prim's algorithms, Warshall's algorithm, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithms. Graph Theory--Including directed graphs, Euler cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles and paths, planar graphs, and weighted graphs. Trees--including binary search trees, weighted trees, tree transversal, Huffman's codes, and spanning trees. Combinatorics--including permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion, partitions, generating functions, Catalan numbers, Sterling numbers, Rook Polynomials, derangements, and enumeration of colors. Algebra--Including semigroups, groups, lattices, semilattices, Boolean algebras, rings, fields, integral domains,[",

    "text": "Just because something doesn't teach everything about a subject doesn't make it a poor instructional aid. Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it. Even if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all. (Though if you end up struggling with the harder topics because you didn't have the rules of algebra appropriately memorized, you might never want to study more of it...)\n\nAlgebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it.\n\nI disagree. I think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with. After all, his goal is to balance an equation, and look, he just balanced it... so what else is there to know? Thus, the memorization approach creates the impression that math (or whatever subject you're studying) is all about arbitrary rules that make no sense; it's all about \"guessing the teacher's password\", and that's boring.\n\nContrast this with the approach of treating an equation like a puzzle. If \"2x - 3 = 5\", and we want to know what x is, there are many ways to approach the solution. We could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales?\", etc. Some possible partial answers are, \"someone took away 3, so let's add it back\", or \"if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution\". But \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer. High scores don't mean anything, algebra does.\n\nWell, I can't speak for others, but my personal experience with math tends to be that I only start properly learning why something works once I have the rules pretty well memorized. Before that, my working memory is so occupied with trying to just remember how to apply the rules that I don't have the space to remember why they work. Or alternatively, I can learn why the rules work - but in that case I don't have the memory capacity left for remembering how to apply them.\n\nOf course, this is complicated by the fact that during the process of trying to memorize the rules, I often stop to think about why they work in an attempt to rederive them and make sure I'm not misremembering them. So it's not pure rote memorization, like the way it seems to be with DragonBox. But I would still expect that if somebody first learned them as meaningless rules in the game, and was then later taught math and the reasons for the rules, they'd have a good chance of being delighted at discovering where the rules came from, and could spend all of their cognitive capacity on developing an actual understanding.\n\nFair enough; it's possible that you and I simply think in different ways. I personally find it very difficult to memorize (seemingly) arbitrary rules, and I found it very difficult to un-teach the \"guess the teacher's password\" mentality to people. But it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.",

He comes to Marlboro after working in several Canadian provinces, and is looking forward to collaborating with logicians in New England and New York.\n\nTeaching Philosophy\n\nFrom his experience as a math teacher and teaching assistant for all levels of undergraduate courses, Jean-Martin has learned that many students, especially in introductory courses, are intimidated by mathematics, and view the material as abstract and tedious. He says, \"I try to show them that mathematics can be fun and useful, and most often, especially at the introductory level, not very far removed from reality. My enthusiasm plays a big part in the process.\"\n\nJean-Martin believes that \"the best way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics, and a big part of doing mathematics is solving problems. I try to show the students that each formula and each theorem is the answer to a particular question, whether the question came from the real world or is mathematics for its own sake.\" He also notes that discussion and teamwork are an important part of learning mathematics. \"Each student will see a problem in a slightly different light, and so each will consider a different approach to the solution.\" He then asks students to try to explain to him or to other students how they arrive at a solution, in order to help them internalize and remember the solution they found. He also encourages mistakes: \"I want the students to fall into traps, make mistakes, and learn to see exactly where they made the mistake, and how to recover from it.\"\n\nScholarly Activities\n\nJean-Martin is interested in mathematical logic, more specifically continuous model theory and its applications to functional analysis. This is a new and exciting area of mathematical logic, which has applications to many other mathematical areas such as algebra, topology, functional analysis, p-adic analysis and probability.\n\nSelected Conference Presentations\n\n\"Strong Conceptual Completeness for First-Order Continuous Logic.\" North American Annual Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, March 2010.",

    "text": "Description: This course studies fundamental algebraic systems in mathematics, selected from groups, rings, fields, and modules. Examples of groups include the invertible matrices with a fixed size and the roots of unity. Rings are illustrated by integers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.) Finally, ordinary vectors in space and any lattice in the plane are examples of modules. The concern with these algebraic systems is not simply the study of individual systems, but also of functions between systems which carry one operation into the other. For instance, the determinant not only converts matrices into numbers, but it sends a product of matrices into a product of numbers. The level of attention given to such operation-preserving transformations (putting them on an equal footing with the algebraic systems they transform) is one of the characteristic features of abstract algebra, and also one of the algebraic ideas which have reached into other areas of mathematics. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in MATH 2142(244) or 2710(213). Recommended preparation: MATH 2210Q(227Q) or 2144Q(246Q).

As a review, this chapter can be assigned at the discretion of the instructor and can also be a valuable reference tool for the student.\n\nThis chapter contains many examples of arithmetic techniques that are used directly or indirectly in algebra. Since the chapter is intended as a review, the problem-solving techniques are presented without being developed. If you would like a quick review of arithmetic before attempting the study of algebra, this chapter is recommended reading. If you feel your arithmetic skills are pretty good, then move on to Basic Properties of Real Numbers ((Reference)). However you feel, do not hesitate to use this chapter as a quick reference of arithmetic techniques.\n\nThe other chapters include Practice Sets paired with Sample Sets with sufficient space for the student to work out the problems. In addition, these chapters include a Summary of Key Concepts, Exercise Supplements, and Proficiency Exams",

This lesson provides a big picture view of the connection between differential and integral calculus and throws in a bit of history, as well. Note: The calculus controversy paper is not included but one can find a number of good resources on the Internet regarding the development of calculus and the role of Newton and Leibnez.\n\nThis video covers the differential notation dy/dx and generalizes the rule for finding the derivative of any polynomial. It also extends the notion of the derivatives covered in the Khan Academy videos, �Calculus Derivatives 2� and �Calculus Derivatives 2.5 (HD).� Note: Additional practice using the power rule for differentiating polynomials (including some with negative exponents) is available to the listener.\n\nThis video is the 4th in a series of videos that explains derivatives. First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.\n\nThis video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.\n\nContinuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions. Note: The current set of practice problems titled �Chain rule 1� cannot be solved until one knows how to find the derivative of ex and trigonometric functions\n\nIn the first example, instead of actually using the quotient rule, Sal rewrites the denominator as a negative exponent and uses the product rule. In subsequent examples, Sal shows, but does not prove, the derivative of several interesting functions including ex, ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x.\n\nAfter defining L�Hopital�s rule, Sal shows an example of using the rule to solve for the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x) / x. He also describes what it means for a fraction to have indeterminate form.\n\nAfter applying L�Hopitals Rule once and showing that the limit is still indeterminate, Sal applies the rule a second and third time before arriving at a limit that exists. He then shows that given that the final limit exits, so do the previous ones including the limit of the first original problem. Note: Practice problems on L�Hopital�s rule are available and can be practiced now or after watching the other example videos.",

    "text": "MAA Review\n\n[Reviewed by Fernando Q. Gouvêa, on 05/20/2010]\n\nLie groups play such a central role in mathematics and its applications that all mathematics students should be aware of them. From computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere. Nevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared. Harriet Pollatsek's Lie Groups is her entry in this list.\n\nHowe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.\n\nLie Groups is fundamentally a problem book: each chapter presents a sequence of problems that students should solve. In each chapter, the main sections are followed by a summary section called \"Putting the pieces together.\" Finally, a section called \"A broader view\" tries to give a wider context to the material in that chapter. Everything important is done through problems. Thus, this is a book to be used, not a book to be read.\n\nI must admit that I find teaching this material to sophomore mathematics majors to be a little bit too much of a reach. Instead, I used the book in a seminar course that followed our standard one-semester introduction to abstract algebra. In the class were six seniors, three juniors, and (yes!) a sophomore; all had taken algebra, either in the previous semester or a year before. Most, but not all, had taken other advanced courses as well, including Real Analysis. My students were assigned problems to solve and present in class, and we developed the theory in that way. Every once in a while, I would step in and give a broader view.\n\nDid it work? Yes, it mostly did, though in the process I discovered that some aspects have to be tweaked a little bit. Because Pollatsek doesn't want to assume any algebra background, there are lots of \"check that SL(2,R) is a group\" problems — more than I or my students wanted. Because she doesn't want to assume much knowledge of topology, she does not have the chance to make much of connectedness, compactness, covering spaces, and (most significant in this context) simple connectedness. This seems like an opportunity lost.\n\nSome choices I just don't understand. Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere? (My students were fascinated.) Why work only with the one-dimensional Lorenz group? Why not have more pictures? After all, it's easy to draw pictures of the one-dimensional Lie groups.\n\nIn many of the problems, there is more handholding than I wanted my students to have; at some points, this included \"hints\" that led towards unnecessarily messy ways of doing things. Pollatsek clearly thinks that students at this level prefer computation to theory. She is probably right, but I would rather not indulge that preference.\n\nSome issues had to do with the fact that my students knew some things that her students didn't (what a group is, what a normal subgroup is) but did not have a sure grasp of some things that her students clearly do have well under control (the example that stands out in my mind is the Jacobian matrix of a differentiable map). The bibliography is also a little strange, too selective for my taste. This proved significant towards the end, when my students were working on term papers and all of them wanted the same books… which were not in our library.\n\nThere is no representation theory at all. The adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context. With no representation theory, one cannot do much more than say \"the physicists use this a lot,\" without showing how or why. That seems like a pity.\n\nPollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book. Using it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing. If that applies to you, give this book a try.\n\nFernando Q. Gouvêa is Carter Professor of Mathematics at Colby College. He'll be doing the Lie groups thing again soon.",

I'm also a Title I tutor (and a summer tutor) so this will help me out a TON when coming up with materials for my students both during Title I tutoring and summer tutoring!\nThe amount of time Lesson Planet will save me is going to be mind blowing!\n\nTitle\n\nResource Type\n\nViews\n\nGrade\n\nRating\n\nAre your calculus pupils aware that they are standing on the shoulders of giants? This lesson provides a big picture view of the connection between differential and integral calculus and throws in a bit of history, as well. Note: The calculus controversy paper is not included but one can find a number of good resources on the Internet regarding the development of calculus and the role of Newton and Leibnez.\n\nThis video covers the differential notation dy/dx and generalizes the rule for finding the derivative of any polynomial. It also extends the notion of the derivatives covered in the Khan Academy videos, �Calculus Derivatives 2� and �Calculus Derivatives 2.5 (HD).� Note: Additional practice using the power rule for differentiating polynomials (including some with negative exponents) is available to the listener.\n\nThis video is the 4th in a series of videos that explains derivatives. First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.\n\nThis video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.\n\nContinuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions. Note: The current set of practice problems titled �Chain rule 1� cannot be solved until one knows how to find the derivative of ex and trigonometric functions\n\nIn the first example, instead of actually using the quotient rule, Sal rewrites the denominator as a negative exponent and uses the product rule. In subsequent examples, Sal shows, but does not prove, the derivative of several interesting functions including ex, ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x.\n\nAfter defining L�Hopital�s rule, Sal shows an example of using the rule to solve for the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x) / x. He also describes what it means for a fraction to have indeterminate form.\n\nAfter applying L�Hopitals Rule once and showing that the limit is still indeterminate, Sal applies the rule a second and third time before arriving at a limit that exists. He then shows that given that the final limit exits, so do the previous ones including the limit of the first original problem. Note: Practice problems on L�Hopital�s rule are available and can be practiced now or after watching the other example videos.",

    "text": "The Cartoon Guide to Calculus Cartoon Guide to Calculus\n\nCalculus is the mathematics of change...and The Cartoon Guide to Calculus represents a big change from previous books on this subject. Using graphics and humor to lighten what is often perceived as a challenging discipline, Larry Gonick teaches all of the essentials, from functions and limits to derivatives and integrals.\n\nThe cartoon's unnamed narrator, with the help of his friend Delta Wye, guides us through a vast range of concepts. We see, for example, how calculus was initially conceived by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz as a way of resolving age-old mysteries involving the calculation of motion. Newton and Leibniz make several cameo appearances within the book, sometimes to quibble with each other regarding who invented calculus first, but mostly to explain a new concept to us. It's fun to learn about instantaneous velocity with an example involving Newton jumping up and down on a trampoline.\n\nWe go on to study a vast range of functions—Gonick invents a function creature to show how they work. We also are treated to a visual definition of the limit that is significantly easier to understand than the algebraic version that has traditionally been taught to generations of students. Learning derivatives in calculus has always involved diagrams, but not quite as vividly as in this book. For example, at one point, the narrator finds himself in a rapidly filling pool of water in order to calculate the instantaneous rate of flow. Equally refreshing is the way the book shows us a sphere literally being cut up into slices in a section that illustrates how to calculate its volume.\n\nComplete with end-of-chapter exercises, The Cartoon Guide to Calculus will inspire even the most math-phobic among",

    "text": "MAA Review\n\n[Reviewed by Peter Rabinovitch, on 09/22/2011]\n\nA rule I have found to be true is that any book claiming to be suitable for beginners and yet leading to the frontiers of unsolved research problems does neither well. This book is the exception to that rule.\n\nA glance at the table of contents reveals many of the standard combinatorics topics. As the title implies, they are generally explored via bijections. As a user of combinatorics, rather than a dyed in the wool combinatorialist, I find bijections to be the central core of the subject and so I found this book engaging.\n\nThe proofs are very clear, and in many cases several proofs are offered. For example, there may be an algebraic proof of an identity, followed by a bijective proof.\n\nThis book could serve several purposes. By focussing on the first half of the book, it could be an excellent choice for a first course in cominatorics for senior undergraduates. By selecting topics and/or moving quickly, it could work well for a more mature audience. The book is at a higher level than Stanton & White, but lower than Stanley, thus it also makes a great reference for people who use combinatorics but are not specialists.\n\nThere are many exercises. The back cover claims nearly 1000, and although I didn't count them, I have no reason to doubt this claim. Some are very simple, and some are hard — the back cover claims some are unsolved. Many of the exercises are discussed in an appendix, ranging in detail from mere hints to \"draw a diagram\" to full but terse solutions. Because there are so many exercises, and because the level of detail of the provided solutions varies so much, an instructor using this text could easily find appropriate problems for assignment for courses of various levels of sophistication.\n\nThere are few obvious typos.\n\nOn the negative side, the book's web site is empty, and the author uses \"quantum numbers\" and \"quantum binomial coefficients\" etc. rather than the more common \"q numbers\" and \"q binomial coefficients.\"\n\nThis is a very nice book that deserves serious consideration.\n\nPeter Rabinovitch is a Systems Architect at Research in Motion, and a PhD student in probability. He's currently thinking about applications of Mallows permutations.",

In fact, it is the one discipline in which low grades and low performance are almost universally acceptable because they are so common. For example, a parent is more likely to excuse a lower report card grade in math than in any other subject because that parent probably got lower grades in math when he or she were in school. But why is math so hard to learn? If we look at the nature of learning math it will become easy to see why it is almost a miracle that anyone (without some innate talent) ever learns math.

The grader strips commas from\nnumbers, so you are free to punctuate numerical responses. If your\nresponse includes a percent sign at the end, your numerical answer\nwill be converted to a percentage (divided by 100).

WELCOME\nbrings together elements of three MAA program themes: academic technology, professional development, and promoting involvement of historically underrepresented groups. The general goals include:\n\nDeveloping at minority serving institutions a community of teachers who create and use interactive, computer based, explorations of mathematics\n\nCreating an internet library of these explorations available to teachers and students everywhere\n\nPromoting the use of interactive explorations in teaching mathematics\n\nTechnology\n\nThe interactive explorations are integrated environments which combine graphical, dynamical, symbolic, textual, and numerical representations of mathematical ideas and relations. Users interact with these environments in the familiar point and click idiom of internet web pages. The goal of each activity is to encourage students to experiment with some mathematical context by manipulating aspects of the environment and observing the results. The interactions are intended to be so natural that the environments take on a kind of virtual realism that brings mathematical constructs to life. This can take the form of moving and deforming geometric objects (in the style of Geometer's Sketchpad), but can also involve interacting with symbolic, logical, and numerical aspects of an environment.\n\nA past MAA effort, the Interactive Mathematical Text Project (IMTP), demonstrated that empowering teachers to create these activities is both feasible and desirable. In particular, using software called Mathwright Author, IMTP participants (among others) have created a large number of educationally interesting and attractive explorations. A showcase of these activities is freely available at the Mathwright website. Visitors to that web site can also download free software called the Mathwright Library Player (2.1), necessary for using the activities.\n\nOne of the goals of Project WELCOME is to produce series of interactive explorations that are directly tied to specific courses. The materials that are produced by the project will be distributed at a WELCOME Library on the internet, starting in the summer or fall of 2001.\n\nMathematical Involvement of Underrepresented Groups\n\nThe MAA has an ongoing interest in increasing the participation in mathematics of historically underrepresented groups. Project WELCOME is founded on the belief that technology can make a contribution in this area. The Project Directors believe that interactive mathematical explorations are a particularly attractive and powerful lure to the investigation of mathematical ideas. It is hoped that this lure will help attract students who might otherwise not elect to study mathematics.\n\nIn order to bring interactive mathematical explorations to these students, WELCOME is enlisting the aid of their teachers. The Project will build a community of Mathwright developers among faculty in institutions which predominantly serve the target populations. The role of teachers in developing, as well as using, Mathwright activities is intentional and significant. For one thing, creating the activities themselves will give the teachers a greater sense of ownership, and will assure that the activities will be compatible with the instructional goals and philosophies of these teachers. There is another reason to involve teachers as developers. Presumably, the historical under-participation among some student populations reflects particular obstacles that these students face. If so, then faculty at institutions which serve these populations may have special insights about the nature of the obstacles and strategies for overcoming them. Such insights will be a valuable resource in developing Mathwright activities for Project WELCOME.\n\nProfessional Development\n\nProject WELCOME has many features in common with MAA professional development programs. The faculty developers will each be teamed with an experienced Mathwright user who will serve as a mentor and collaborator. The goals of the project go beyond training new Mathwright developers. The idea is to foster a community of teachers using interactive explorations. The community will interact electronically through email and a project web page. In addition, participants will get together at national MAA meetings, where they will be encouraged to make presentations of their work. In particular, there will be several contributed paper presentations related to WELCOME at the January, 2001 meeting in New Orleans.\n\nProject Activities\n\nEach year of the project begins with a workshop for new faculty particpants and mentors. In 2000, the summer workshop was held in Seattle, and was attended by 6 new faculty developers, 4 mentors, as well as the project directors. During the 2000-2001 academic year the developer teams will work on Mathwright activities related to the classes of the new faculty developers. Work in progress will be shared at the winter 2001 math meetings, and more completed work at the summer meeting. At about the same time, a new class of faculty developers will be meet in a workshop, as mentioned earlier.\n\nThe materials that are produced by WELCOME participants will be reviewed and critiqued by an outside board of editors. Ultimately, the finished products will be distributed over the internet at a Project WELCOME website.",

They will learn to author their own programs that analyze, convert, effect, and manipulate real time video and audio streams towards their own ends. Music is made, video is sequenced and stories are told Through the use of algorithms, conditionals, and operators. Media production is now firmly located in the digital domain and math has become an essential and flexible creative tool. Whereas packaged digital programs are designed around preconceived tasks, in this class artists pick up the equivalent of a stick, cram it in the digital morass and turn history on it's ear. The proof of this mathematics is in the making of media. This class will use Max/MSP/Jitter, a graphically based authoring program that allows one to program in a visual environment. In addition to real time video and audio processing students will learn to create 2D and 3D graphics and imbue them with interactive behaviors.",

    "text": "Integral Calculus: An Introduction to the Anti-Derivative\n\nIf a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The function for which the integral is calculated is called the integrand. The region over which a function is being integrated is called the domain of integration.\n\nIn this class, the presenter will introduce the concept of Integration. We will describe it as simply, the reverse process of differentiation, hence, also called Anti-Differentiation.\n\nThe integral may be found without a definite specification or for a particular region leading to the development of indefinite & definite integrals. In case of the definite integrals, the domain of integration is defined by specifying the upper & lower limits of the enclosed region. Also, definite integrals may not be referred to as anti-derivatives which is a term used only for indefinite integrals in accordance with the fundamental theorem of calculus. Besides, the indefinite integral may be a constant or a function of the independent variable however, the definite integral is always constant.\n\nWe will also discuss about the geometrical & physical representation & significance of the integral. When we look into the practical applications of integrals, they appear in a number of practical situations.\n\nConsider a swimming pool. If it is rectangular, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. The best of problems in Physics too involve the integral.\n\nAbout Rishabh Dev (Teacher)\n\nRishabh Dev is a teacher in Calculus & other mathematics disciplines. Dev has a remarkable style of delivering the very advanced math concepts useful for the various competitive exams in a very basic manner understandable to all.\n\nHe has developed innovative ways of teaching mathematics to his students. Rishabh teaches online and also takes face-to-face math classes for students in Bangalore / Bengaluru Area, Karnataka",

This book is designed to revive this art, focusing more on the aspects of learning the ideas behind the math rather than the sheer mechanics of mathematical operation. This text addresses the art of teaching mathematics while also providing specific aids and activities in arithmetic, geometry, algebra and probability and statistics for use in the classroom. The authors pay close attention to the role, importance, methods and techniques of motivation. They present ideas that will generate attention, interest, and surprise among students, and will thus foster creative thinking. The material in the text is based on talks given by the authors at professional meetings, as well as the actual application of their ideas in undergraduate and graduate classes they taught. Additionally, many laboratory and discovery activities have been used by authors in teaching junior and senior high school math classes.

I will use this site to post all assignments, class notes, solutions, and items of interest for each of my classes.\n\nAP Physics C Electricity & Magnetism\n\nA rigorous calculus-based physics course is an essential requirement for every student in the field of engineering or the physical sciences. This course will provide you with the opportunity to apply calculus to the physical principles underlying the laws of nature. Major emphasis is on problem solving with laboratory work and class demonstrations to provide data for developing analytical models that can be understood and manipulated mathematically.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, linear algebra/matrix theory is an absolute requirement. Linear Algebra is the mathematical study of vectors and vector spaces (also called linear spaces). Matrices are widely used to represent the linear transformations that input one vector and output another. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Calculus. The only REAL prerequisite for this material is a good knowledge of high school algebra. We have designated AB Calculus as a requirement because everyone will need strong algebra skills and good analytical ability. Linear Algebra has many practical applications, not limited to math/physics/engineering. It shows up in economics, logistics, finance, computer science, operations research, and lots of other disciplines.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, advanced calculus is an absolute requirement. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Advanced Placement Calculus AB & BC. The material in these courses however, has generally been limited to one independent variable expressed in the form of y = f(x). Multivariable/vector calculus is used to describe phenomena that result from the simultaneous effects of many variables. For example, in the case of the ideal gas law from chemistry, the pressure of an ideal gas is a result of the number of moles of the gas, the volume of the container, and the temperature. We could express this as P = f(n,V,T). If all three are changed simultaneously, how is the pressure changed?\n\nPre-AP PreCalculus provides opportunities to study real numbers, functions and their graphs, trigonometric relationships, parametric representations, sequences, and series. This course provides the necessary foundation for advanced placement or college calculus. Extends and builds on the foundation for the Advanced Placement program. Includes all of the regular Precalculus course with extensions, both guided and independent, in the areas of symbolic logic, linear programming, applications of polar coordinates, and topics from discrete mathematics. Typically, after taking Pre-AP PreCalculus a student would take AP Statistics and/or AP Calculus AB.",

Unlike other books, this one \"teaches by example\". I always found that too many college professors & textbooks spend too much time trying to \"explain\" the concept. My experience has been to skip the lecture part, do the problems, and in doing so, the concept will come to you. The fact that the problems are all solved in detail is also a plus. A lot of texts simply list the answer to the problem, so you're often left wondering how they got it. This won't be an issue with this text.\n\nThis is exactly what the title says\n\nBy ophelia99 - January 3, 2005\n\nEven if you understand the principles, the handful of problems in the average textbook are too few to really drill you on the procedures. It's a little like the difference between understanding some music theory and being able to play an instrument. Practice, for those of us who are not math prodigies, is essential.

    "text": "About Me\n\nWednesday, August 31, 2011\n\nMost math text books have examples that are completely worked out with the solution given. Take a piece of paper and hide the textbook answer and work, but show the question. Redo the problem and then check your work with their work and solution.\n\n2. Study for Tests and Quizzes.\n\nIt is easy to just do the review homework and feel like you are ready for the test. You need to do this and more. Study for the test or quiz by going back through problems that have been given and solved in class. Actually redo them and check your work. Studying for math is DOING the MATH.\n\n3. Make sure your homework is correct.\n\nCheck your answers with those that are in the back of the book while you are doing your assignment.\n\n4. Do math EVERYDAY.\n\nDo your homework every day. Try not to skip any days of homework. If you are cramming all your work into a short single session you will find this usually ends up in frustration as well as poor long term memory with the topic.\n\n5. Attempt the most difficult questions.\n\nThe most difficult questions will usually teach you the most about the material. Never skip them. Try to get the most exposure to these problems as you can. Try to solve them on your own. Revisit them. Go in for help. Ask a question on the problems in class.\n\n6. Take a break.\n\nGive yourself a break when working with math. If you are being efficient, then three fifteen minute sessions in a day are better than one 45 minute session. Stand up. Stretch. Go for a walk. Move your work to a new place. A break is needed when working with math.\n\n7. Have a good attitude.\n\nNever think \"I'm terrible at math\". You usually meet your own expectations. Believe that you can do it!\n\n8. Go in for help with your teacher and bring a specific question.\n\nWhen you bring in a specific question to your math teacher they can help you with where you are struggling. The teacher then can typically give you more examples that are similar to what you are struggling with.\n\n9. 5 minutes.\n\nOnce your homework is done, then take an extra 5 minutes to look at these possible things: vocabulary, formulas, notes, projects, and book examples.\n\nWednesday, August 24, 2011\n\nYesterday I made a math problem so that it took up one whole page of typing paper. I cut it up into 6 equal pieces that were approximately 3 by 3 inches. I put it a random order and put a paper clip on it. I did this for 5 problems in all and 2 sets of each for a total of 10 questions. I have 20 students in my class. So I had my students work in pairs. It is real easy to cut these problems up with a paper cutter. See the above cut out lines that I took with the problem.\n\nThen I put the 5 stations with 2 sets of the same problem around the room. Four people, or two pairs of partners would be at each station. I would then have them start on the problem and set the timer for ONE MINUTE. The partners together would have to unscramble the pieces and then solve the problem. They would write their answer down on their paper. Once they were done, they could check the answer that is provided at each station. After the minute was over and students had checked their answers, I told them to rotate. They went to the next station and we did the process all over again.\n\nI was happy with the outcome because they seemed to enjoy trying to figure out the puzzle and do the math. It also helps the students to MOVE and LEARN. They are moving after each problem.",

    "text": "Algebra: A Complete Course\n\nby VideoText Interactive\n\nIs VideoText a Pre-Algebra course, an Algebra 1 course, an Algebra 2 course, or all of these courses?\n\nThe reason that we named our program \"Algebra: A Complete Course,\" is that we believe the best way to learn Algebra is to start at the beginning and end at the end! In this program you will find a complete study of the essential material covered in a traditional Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 course.\n\nHowever, we need to continue a little further with this answer because Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are terms that refer mostly to the traditional way that Algebra has been taught. Traditional Algebra 1 classes attempt to cover most of Algebra in the first year, but the methods that are used, and the speed with which the material is covered, hinders student understanding of the material. Instead, the student is just exposed to memorizing rules, formulas, tricks, and shortcuts. By the time they get to what is called an Algebra 2 course, (sometimes after they take a Geometry course), they have forgotten almost all of the Algebra that they memorized. So, that Algebra 2 course (which is by definition, a rehash of whatever has been called \"Algebra 1\"), must repeat practically all of the Algebra 1 course. In fact, it usually repeats a lot of the Pre-Algebra material as well. This is usually referred to as the \"spiral method\" of learning, and it is not very effective in helping students to excel, especially at this level of mathematics.\n\nWe think that this huge overlap is generally unproductive, and largely unnecessary if the concepts are taught analytically. Therefore we call our program \"Algebra: A Complete Course,\" because we employ a mastery-learning approach, sometimes moving at a slower pace, but without the overlap. As a result, students often complete the course even more quickly.\n\nVideoText's Algebra: A Complete Course program contains 176 video lessons contained in 10 unit directories. The program covers Pre-Algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II, and is a firm foundation for students advancing to VideoText's Geometry: A Complete Course, covering Geometry and Trigonometry.\n\nMaterials in the complete course include:\n\n176 Video Lessons - Each of the 5-10 minute lessons explore Algebra concepts in a detailed logical order. Because no shortcuts or tricks are used, the methods are easy to follow and promote clear understanding.\n\n360 pages of Course Notes - These notes allow students to review the logical development of a concept. Each page chronologically follows the video lesson, repeating exactly what was shown on the screen.\n\n590 pages of Student WorkText - These pages review the concept developed in each lesson. More examples are given and exercises are provided for students. The explanations are virtually free of complicated language, making it easy for students to follow the logic of each concept.\n\nSolutions Manuals - These manuals provide detailed, step-by-step solutions for every problem in the student WorkText. This resource is a powerful tool when used by students to complete an error-analysis of their work, and to check their thought processes.\n\nProgress Tests - These tests, with the answer keys included, are designed to have students demonstrate understanding, lesson-by-lesson, and unit-by-unit. There are two versions of each test, allowing for retesting or review, to make sure students have mastered concepts.\n\nThe quality of mathematics is extremely important to me, as math and science go hand-in-hand. There are many students who cannot handle my chemistry course, for example, because they have not had a good algebra course. That is why I strongly encourage you to look at Videotext Interactive's algebra course. It is, truly, the best that I have seen.\n\nThe course teaches real mathematics. It does not use tricks or shortcuts. Instead, it teaches the student to think mathematically. That's what is missing from many algebra courses! The use of animation and graphics is excellent. They do not detract from the learning, as is the case with some video courses I have seen. Instead, they enhance the student's ability to understand what is happening in each and every step along the way.\n\nIf you want your student to really learn algebra, then you should use this course. In short, this course is a scientist's dream come true! Every science-oriented student should use it",

    "text": "Description\n\nThis accessible text is designed to help readers help themselves to excel. The content is organized into two parts: (1) A Library of Elementary Functions (Chapters 1—2) and (2) Finite Mathematics (Chapters 3—Features\n\nExamples are annotated and the problem-solving steps are clearly identified. This gives students extra assistance in understanding the solution.\n\nSelected examples include steps that are usually performed mentally to provide a \"basics refresher\" for students who need it. (These steps are set off with dashed lines; see page 109, example 4.)\n\nA Matched Problem follows each example, providing students with an opportunity to reinforce and test understanding before moving on.\n\nMore than 5,600 carefully selected and graded exercises are designed to help you craft the right assignments for students.\n\nA, B, and C levels of exercises make it easy to appropriately challenge your students.\n\nPaired exercises of the same type and difficulty level (consecutive odd and even) allow you control over student use of answers (odd answers at the back of the text).\n\nAmple and up-to-date applications illustrate the relevance of mathematics and give students opportunities to create and interpret mathematical models.\n\nOptional graphing-utility and spreadsheet examples and exercises are clearly identified by an icon. These provide a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and allow students to solve problems that are not feasible to solve by hand.\n\nExplore & Discuss problems in every section encourage students to think about a relationship or process before a result is stated or to investigate additional consequences of a development in the text. These problems can help students of all levels gain better insight into the mathematical concepts and are effective in both small and large classroom settings.\n\nConceptual Insight boxes, appearing in nearly every section, make explicit connections to previously learned concepts, helping students place this new information in context.\n\nAn Algebra Diagnostic Test prior to Chapter 1 helps students assess their prerequisite skills, while the Basic Algebra Review in Appendix A (referenced in the answers to the Algebra Diagnostic Test) provides students with the content they need to remediate those skills.\n\nChapter Reviews include exercises at the A, B, and C levels as well as thorough end-of-chapter summaries keyed by page number to worked examples within the chapter.\n\nTopic selection, coverage, and organization reflect the course outlines and catalogs of many major colleges and universities. This text takes into account the way the course is typically taught and gives students the essential mathematical skills needed to effectively pursue courses of study in business and economics.\n\nA Library of Elementary Functions (Chapters 1 & 2) provides optional material that can be covered in its entirety or referred to as needed. These chapters encourage students to view mathematical ideas and processes graphically, numerically, and algebraically.\n\nEmphasis on the construction of mathematical models, especially in linear systems and linear programming, gives students critical tools for solving application problems.\n\nTechnology coverage is optional, but brief discussions on using graphing calculators and spreadsheets are included where appropriate.\n\nMini-Lectures are included for most sections from the text and provide additional classroom examples, a summary of suggested learning objectives to cover, and teaching notes for the material. These mini-lectures are ideal for instructors who do not teach this course frequently, or just need some additional guidance or resources. Mini-lectures are available for download from the Instructor Resource Center as well as within MyMathLab®.\n\nWorksheets for Classroom or Lab Practice offer a convenient, ready-to-use format, with ample space for students to show their work. The worksheets are written specifically for this text, are organized by Learning Objective, and highlight key Vocabulary Terms and Vocabulary Exercises for student reference as a study guide.\n\nMyMathLab features an ample selection of homework exercises plus instructional videos for every example in the text.\n\nAuthor",

Includes questions drawn from geometry, group theory, linear algebra, and other fields never comes to see her, but he says she has a 50-50 chance. He has had dinner with her twice in the last 20 working days. Explain. Marvin's adventures in probability are one of the fifty intriguing puzzles that illustrate both elementary ad advanced aspects of probability, each problem designed to challenge the mathematically inclined. From \"The Flippant Juror\" and \"The Prisoner's Dilemma\" to \"The Cliffhanger\" and \"The Clumsy Chemist,\" they provide an ideal supplement for all who enjoy the stimulating fun of mathematics. Professor Frederick Mosteller, who teaches statistics at Harvard University, has chosen the problems for originality, general interest, or because they demonstrate valuable techniques. In addition, the problems are graded as to difficulty and many have considerable stature. Indeed, one has \"enlivened the research lives of many excellent mathematicians.\" Detailed solutions are included. There is every probability you'll need at least a few of them.\n\nBonus Editorial Feature:\n\nFrederick Mosteller (1916–2006) founded Harvard University's Department of Statistics and served as its first chairman from 1957 until 1969 and again for several years in the 1970s. He was the author or co-author of more than 350 scholarly papers and more than 50 books, including one of the most popular books in his field, first published in 1965 and reprinted by Dover in 1987, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions.\n\nMosteller's work was wide-ranging: He used statistical analysis of written works to prove that James Madison was the author of several of the Federalist papers whose authorship was in dispute. With then–Harvard professor and later Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, he studied what would be the most effective way of helping students from impoverished families do better in school — their answer: to improve income levels rather than to simply spend on schools. Later, his analysis of the importance to learning of smaller class sizes buttressed the Clinton Administration's initiative to hire 100,000 teachers. And, as far back as the 1940s, Mosteller composed an early statistical analysis of baseball: After his team, the Boston Red Sox, lost the 1946 World Series, he demonstrated that luck plays an enhanced role in a short series, even for a strong team. In the Author's Own Words: \"Though we often hear that data can speak for themselves, their voices can be soft and sly.\" — Frederick Mosteller",

    "text": "What Kind of Problems Might I Work On?\n\nWhile they may differ widely by discipline and job title, one thing remains constant among careers in mathematics—problem solving. Some potential problems that someone with mathematical training might encounter are briefly discussed below. It may be useful to note which of them you find most intriguing, and why.\n\nHow can an airline use smarter scheduling to reduce costs of aircraft parking and engine maintenance?\n\nHow can one design a detailed plan for a clinical trial? Building such a plan requires advanced statistical skills and sophisticated knowledge of the design of experiments.\n\nIs ethanol a viable solution for the world's dependence on fossil fuels? Can biofuel production be optimized to combat negative implications on the world's economy and environment?\n\nHow can automotive systems become more efficient and reduce emissions as mandated by U.S. public policy?\n\nHow do we use major advances in computing power to incorporate knowledge about interactions between the oceans, the atmosphere and living ecosystems into models used to predict long-term change?\n\nHow can automotive and aircraft companies test performance, safety, and ergonomics, while at the same time lowering the cost of construction and testing prototypes?\n\nA pharmaceutical company wants to\nsearch a very large database of proteins to find one that is similar in shape or activity to one they have discovered. What's the most efficient way to do so?\n\nHow might disease spread in populated areas in the event of\na bioterrorism incident, and how would it be contained?\n\nHow do you design a robotic hand to grip a coin and drop it in\na slot?\n\nHow can you mathematically model the spread of a forest fire depending on weather, ground cover and type of trees?\n\nHow can you allocate an investment among various financial instruments to meet a risk/reward trade-off?\n\nSince a chemical company cannot test potential new products by releasing them into the atmosphere, it must develop models of atmospheric chemistry that simulate the complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Can computational simulations show sufficient detail to capture the effects of the chemicals, but still be fast enough to permit studies of many different chemicals?\n\nHow can genome sequencing analysis help in making clinical decisions based on a personalized medicine approach?\n\nRecommendation algorithms provide users of e-commerce systems with unique ratings and recommendations of items and products based on their past purchases, behavior and interests. How can mathematics improve rating prediction performance and help enhance the consumer experience?\n\nPart of the preparation for your future is obtaining a solid foundation in mathematical and computational knowledge—tools like differential equations, probability, combinatorics, applied algebra, and matrices, as well as the art of abstraction and advanced computing and programming skills.

The overarching goal of the program is that all students be able to reason and communicate proficiently in mathematics. CMP helps students develop an understanding of important concepts, skills, procedures, and ways of thinking and reasoning in number sense, measurement, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics. The concepts are embedded in engaging problems that students explore individually, in a small group, or with a whole class. The problems presented over time give student practice with important concepts, related skills, and algorithms. A three-phased workshop model that support s problem centered instruction is used to deliver the curriculum in these classes. Teachers have had opportunities for training in CMP2 made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, and CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning. The District Math Coaches and Lesley University will continue to provide teachers with training in the mathematical content and implementation of lessons.\n\nThe Math programs are implemented using the Workshop Model. This three-phase instructional workshop model used to deliver instruction in all math classrooms in grades K - 8. In the initial phase, Launch or Opening – the teacher sets the problem, introduces new ideas, clarifies definitions reviews, old concepts, and connects to past experiences without lowering the challenge of the task. During the second phase, Explore or Work Time – students work independently or in small groups to gather data, share ideas, look for patterns, and make conjectures. In the final phase Summary or Closing – the students present and discuss their solutions as well as the strategies they used as the teacher guides them to reach the mathematical goal of the class and connect their new understanding to prior knowledge. Teachers have had opportunities for training on the workshop model made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning, and Math Investigations Training from Hampshire Educational Collaborative. District Math Coaches will continue to work with teachers to enhance the implementation of the program and help to deepen the understanding and connection of the mathematical strands.\n\nCurriculum Maps for K – 8 have been designed to ensure that students are exposed to a rigorous curriculum in every school and every grade, and to have consistent instruction and assessment district wide. The district's expectation is for students to successfully meet the Massachusetts Mathematics Standards and to score at the proficient range on the MCAS test in mathematics. In order to facilitate this, teachers are required to follow the curriculum maps. The successful implementation of these maps requires teachers to work through the project and problems prior to planning their lessons. The math coaches and other district personnel were trained in curriculum mapping by America's Choice, became the principle architects of the documents, and are now providing professional development to the grade level teachers as the first of these maps are available.",

    "text": "Synopses & Reviews\n\nPublisher Comments:\n\nBEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995. He is a full-time Associate Professor at Palomar College and has taught there for the past 9 years. He is a member of AMATYC and regularly attends the national AMATYC and ICTCM conferences. He has also done extensive reviewing and testing of various classroom technologies and materials. Through this work, he is committed to teaching his students through applications and using technology to help his students both understand the mathematics in context and communicate their results clearly. Intermediate algebra is one of his favorite courses to teach, and he continues to teach several sections of this course each year.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\"This book has just the right balance of skill and application problems.It does a good job of helping the students throughout the sectionswithout just giving all the answers away.\"Kate Bella, Instructor, Manchester Community College \"It is easily readable for students, the explanations are clear, and themargin notes are a nice feature that makes the text more reader friendly.\"Daniel Lopez, Instructor, Brookdale Community College \"I love how the text is centered on real-life situations.

    "text": "Mathematics Department Handbook\n\nWelcome to the Department of Mathematics at the University of Rochester.\n\nWe have compiled these notes in order to assist you, the first year\nstudent, in making the transition from high school to university. This\nis sometimes a difficult process for various reasons. As far as first\nyear mathematics courses go, there are two main difficulties:\n\nFirst, the Department of Mathematics expects students who take courses\nin mathematics to take the responsibility for mastering the course\nmaterial. There is lots of assistance offered, all detailed in these\nnotes, but it is your responsibility to use these resources. Second,\nmany talented students have been able to do well in their high school\nmath courses in spite of not having regular work habits, but now the\nsituation is very different. It is almost impossible to pass first\nyear university mathematics courses without developing these habits.\nWe hope this Guide will help you learn how.\n\nWe have also included in these notes some hints on study techniques and\nwriting examinations, expanded descriptions of first year courses, and a\nreading list for students interested in expanding their knowledge of\nmathematics in a general way.\n\nAgain, welcome, and we wish you every success in your academic\nendeavors.",

    "text": "MATH 240\n\nUsing a calculator\n\nSolving a system of linear equations on a computer or calculator\nis surprisingly difficult.\nInverting a matrix or performing certain other matrix operations\ncan lead to numerical errors that require a lot of theory to understand.\nOur department has an entire undergraduate course,\nMath 434, Numerical Linear Algebra,\nthat covers numerical techniques in linear algebra.\nWe do not have enough time to discuss numerical algorithms in MATH 240,\nand if you do not know the relevant theory,\nyou must be very cautious and skeptical about the answer\nwhen you just press a button on your calculator.\n\nSolving a system of equations\n\nIf you have been trained to believe that\na calculator will always give you the correct answer,\nyou may be in for a shock\nif you try to solve a system of equations\nby just plugging the coefficients into your calculator and pressing a button.\nEven a system of two equations in two unknowns\ncan present problems for the program used by your calculator.\nHere is one example.\n\nWe will try to solve this system of equations.\n\n416785x + 415872y = 1\n415872x + 414961y = 0\n\nThe coefficients in the problem have six significant digits.\nSince the TI-85 calculator stores more than twice that many\nsignificant digits internally,\nsolving the system would seem to present no problem.\nUsing the equation solver on the TI-85 gives the following \"answer\".\n\nYou can \"check\" the calculator answer by substituting it\nback into the system.\nBe sure to use the values stored in the calculator.\nThen, to the limits of the calculator's accuracy,\neverything checks out,\nand, in fact, both solutions appear to be correct.\n\nTo find the exact solution,\nwe can use elementary row operations on the system of equations.\nThe first goal is to reduce the size of the numbers,\nbut retain integer values.\nHere are the results.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to the TI-85.\nUsing MATLAB on a SUN workstation also gives\nan answer that differs substantially from the correct one.\nThe difficulties are inherent in the problem.\nTo look at this problem from the geometric point of view,\nwe could compute the slope of each line.\nTo 12 decimal point accuracy, we get\n\n416785 ÷ 415872 = -1.00219538704\n415872 ÷ 414961 = -1.00219538704\n\nTo most calculators, the lines appear to be parallel,\nand so there should be no solution at all!\nBecause the angle between the two lines is very small,\na small change in the coefficients caused by roundoff error\ncan make a very large difference in the solution.\nFrom a geometric point of view,\nshifting the two lines just a little bit\ncan make a bit difference in the point of intersection.\n\nInverting a matrix\n\nIn the previous problem,\nwe were able to find an exact inverse for the coefficient matrix.\n\nTo illustrate some of the inherent difficulties\nin doing Gaussian elimination using floating point arithmetic,\nwe will look at the row reduction of a standard \"badly behaved\" matrix.\n\nThe matrix given below is called a Hilbert matrix.\nIt is a well-known example of a matrix that causes problems\nfor numerical algorithms.\nTo help understand the problems,\nwe will do an exact row reduction,\ncompared to a row reduction done using floating point arithmetic.\nTo see how the error in the approximations can be compounded,\nwe will use a highly simplified example,\nin which the floating point arithmetic\nis carried out with accuracy to only three significant digits.\n\nIn the original matrix, labeled (1),\nsome of the decimal entries are already inaccurate.\nIn matrix (3), the three digit computation that produces the\n3rd entry in row 4 is this:\n\n.837×10-1 - (.904)(.830×10-1)\n=.837×10-1 -.750×10-1\n=.870×10-2\n\nComparing this to the correct value of\n1 ÷ 120 =.00833 (to 3 digits)\nshows that it has only one correct digit.\n\nIn matrix (5), the last entry of row 4 is computed as follows:\n\n.837×10-2 - (.690)(.127×10-1)\n=.837×10-2 -.876×10-2\n=.006×10-2\n\nBecause we have to subtract two values that are nearly equal,\nthe answer has even less accuracy.\nThe cumulative errors in reducing just 3 rows\nproduce a value of -.0000600 instead of\n(-1) ÷ 4200 = -.000238 (to 3 digits).\n\nThe method for defining a Hilbert matrix can be extended to larger sizes,\nand the 10 by 10 Hilbert matrix presents substantial problems\nfor even a very sophisticated numerical algorithm.\nYou can experiment on your calculator,\nby inverting the Hilbert matrices of larger and larger sizes.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nYves Nievergelt,\nNumerical Linear Algebra on the HP-28 or How to Lie With Supercalculators,\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly, (1991), 539-544",

    "text": "Mathematics\n\nThe maths department see mathematics as an engaging and creative activity that develops a student's ability to not only think in an organised and logical way, but also for them to look at imaginative ways to solve problems. As such our emphasis is on students developing transferable skills that are honed using the traditional mathematics content and rigor, but with the students engaging with a more task-led curriculum, that allows them to identify the mathematics required to solve problems and gives them ample opportunity to experiment.\n\nKey Stage 3\n\nWe have a two year Key Stage 3 where our aim is to teach the students to develop self-learning skills. This is achieved by giving the students every opportunity to develop thinking skills through themed tasks. The emphasis is not on a correct answer, but on developing a range of strategies to cope with the ever changing world of the 21st century and for these skills to be transferable. We wish to allow the students to continue to improve on their arithmetic, with an emphasis on the development of the \"numerate student\" who uses a variety of methods of calculation, that depends on the numbers used and the degree of accuracy required. The students also engage with geometry and algebra through tasks where \"doing and applying\" mathematics is not a separate part, but integral to their success. This will enable them to enter their Key Stage 4 with the skill to pursue a functional approach to their learning.\n\nKey Stage 4\n\nStudents are entered at either Higher or Foundation Level GCSE, but the skills initiated at Key Stage 3 are further developed and the aspects of functionality and enquiry are keenly pursued, so that students can transfer their skills to new and more demanding areas of mathematics. We follow a linear course which has two terminal examinations. Students are entered for their final exam when it is appropriate, with their final opportunity to take the examinations at the end of Year 11.\n\nKey Stage 5\n\nWe offer both Maths and Further Maths at Key Stage 5.\n\nA Level Maths has four Pure Maths core modules: two in Year 12 and two in Year 13, supported with Statistics in Year 12 and Mechanics in Yearr 13.\n\nIf a student opts for Further Maths, this is run in conjunction with the Further Maths support network where the students have a wide choice of modules that they complete online.",

    "text": "Tutorial 1\n\nOnce you have access to an installation of Mathematica, you need to know how to\nuse it.\n\nOpening the Program\n\nIn an on-campus computer lab, go to Start Menu, then Programs, then Wolfram Mathematica. Click\non the icon for Mathematica, named Spikey.\n\nUp will pop an introductory window. On the left hand side of this button is an option to create a new Mathematica notebook or open an old one. The\nnotebook is where all your interactions with the program will take place.\n\nFirst steps with Mathematica\n\nOpen the file. The file should look like a \"Powerpoint\" Presentation. If it does not, go to the Format Menu and click on \"Format > Screen Environment > SlideShow\".\n\nFollow this tutorial step-by-step and discuss the most interesting aspects\nwith your neighbors.\n\nAt the end of the tutorial, you should use the remaining time to explore the power of Mathematica. I suggest looking in the Documentation Center (Help Menu) or at the Wolfram Demonstrations Project. Feel free to explore on your own or with your neighbors. If you are having trouble getting started, here is what I do when I am exploring:\n\nI go to the Documentation Center and type in a command (such as Manipulate)\n\nI do a quick look at the selected examples that are given and see if they are interesting.\n\nIf so, I want to see all the examples. So I select the entire notebook (Ctrl-A or Apple-A) and then open all subgroups (Cell Menu: \"Grouping > Open All Subgroups\").\n\nI play around with the examples, moving sliders, changing variables to see what happens.\n\nIf I see a command I do not know, I will search for it in the Documentation Center\n\nAt the bottom of the file is a \"See Also\" section, which tells you similar commands.\n\nAlso at the bottom are links to more in depth tutorials, which can be useful sometimes.\n\nOther Items of Note!\n\nIn Mathematica, it is important to distinguish between parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}:\n\nParentheses (): Used to group mathematical expressions, such as (3+4)/(5+7).\n\nBrackets []: Used when calling functions, such as N[Pi].\n\nBraces {}: Used when making lists, such as {i,1,20}.\n\nIf you use the wrong symbols in the wrong places or if you do not have a closing symbol for every opening symbol, Mathematica will\ngive you an error.\n\nMathematica is Case-SenSitive (AA is not the same as aA), so\nbe careful about what you type.\nMany of your initial errors will come about because of one of the two above problems.\n\nIn Mathematica, there are four types of equals: =, :=, ==, and\n===. You need to understand the difference between the first two.\n\nTo define a variable to store it in memory, use =. For example, to define z to be 3, write\nz=3.\n\nYou use == to check for equality. For example, 1-1==0 will\nevaluate to True and 1==0 will evaluate to False.\n\nYou use := to define your own command. (This is advanced.)\n\nYou will likely not use === in this class.\n\nOne of the most important things to do is explore. If you are having trouble with a certain function, use the\n? command to ask for help. Enter? Table and the output will be a yellow box\nwith a quick synopsis of the command. For more detailed information, click the blue >> at the bottom\nright of this yellow box. This will open the Documentation Center\nwhich gives examples of using the\ncommand in action, available options for this command,\nand anything else you might want to know about the command.\n\nAlgebra and Calculus\n\nMathematica will do everything your calculator can and more.\n\nUse ^ to put something to a power.\n\npi is Pi, e is E and sqrt(-1) is I.\n\nIf you want to see the numerical approximation to a fraction or irrational number, use the function N. For example, to find the decimal represenation of pi, write N[Pi].\n\nUse E^x or Exp[x] to represent the function ex.\n\nTo take the derivative of a function, use D and specify the derivative with respect to which\nvariable. For instance D[x^2 + 3x, x].\n\nTo take the integral of a function, use Integrate and specify the integral with respect to\nwhich variable. For instance Integrate[x^2 + 3x, x].\n\nTo solve for the roots of ax2+bx+c=0 symbolically, use Solve[a x^2 + b x + c == 0, x].\nNotice the double equals sign. (Mathematica is searching for when the expression is True.)\n\nCoefficient[(1 + x)^10, x^3] gives the coefficient of x3 in the expansion\nof (1 + x)10.",

    "text": "9780199602124\n\nFree Delivery in U.K\n\nSynopsis: : Maths for Economics\n\nMany years of Teaching led Geoff Renshaw to develop Maths for Economics as a resource which builds your self-confidence in maths by using a gradual learning gradient and constantly reinforcing learning with examples and exercises. Some students embarking on this module feel that they have lost their confidence in maths, or perhaps never had any in the first place. The author has designed the Book so that whether you have a maths A level, GCSE, or perhaps feel that you need to go back over the very basics, Knowledge is built up in small steps, not big jumps. Once you are confident that you have firmly grasped the foundations, this book will help you to make the progression beyond the Mechanical exercises and into the development of a maths tool-kit for the analysis of economic and Business problems. This is a skill which will prove valuable for your degree and for your future employers.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nGeoff Renshaw, Department of Economics, University of Warwick\n\nFeatures\n\n* The flexible design of the contents means that this book is suitable if your starting point is maths A level, GCSE, or even if you have forgotten most of the maths you learned in school.\n* A gradual learning gradient underpins the text; each concept is explored comprehensively, including numerous examples and exercises at each stage to ensure that you get a really good understanding of it.\n* Builds self-confidence in maths through the use of step-by-step examples, progress exercises, hints and rules, encouraging you to develop a'maths tool-kit' for analysing economics and business problems.\n* Any unnecessarily long explanations have been rewritten to make the exposition clearer in the appropriate places.\n* Material on matrix algebra, limits, and necessary and sufficient functions has been revised in line with market feedback\n* Answers to the progress exercises now appear at the end of the book, rather than online, for ease of use.\n\nBook Information\n\nThe Title \"Maths for Economics \" is written by Geoff Renshaw. This book was published in the year 2011. The ISBN number 0199602123|9780199602124 is assigned to the Paperback version of this title. This book has total of pp. 712 (Pages). The publisher of this title is Oxford University Press. We have about 84121 other great books from this publisher. Maths for Economics is currently Available with us.",

    "text": "Transforming? There is a step before applying the technique of \"completing the square\" that is required and that is to come up with the technique of completing the square in the first place. You're not suggesting that the purpose of a course in elementary algebra is to just teach a finite set of techniques to be memorized, understood and used when appropriate, are you? Although I agree that is a subset of the purpose of an algebra class, that still leaves a lot of gaps in between those (finite number of) techniques taught in an algebra class and the only way to fill those gaps is that the student also develop the skill to invent new solutions without prior art. And some techniques, even though they are labeled \"techniques\" are not algorithmic or formulaic at all, such as substitution of variables or induction. Most students are poor with these because they are just a very high level form and the student must fill in the form with a solution. Call it study, call it practice, call it whatever, but there is a lot of brain work left to do even after you see that a technique works.\n\nBob Hansen\n\nOn Jul 18, 2012, at 3:03 PM, Louis Talman wrote:\n\n> And, in particular, I never thought of learning to complete a square as \"studying the solution of quadratic equations\".

    "text": "Improve Your Note Taking\n\nImproving Math Skills\n\nWhen studying for math, we often use exercises, worksheets and sample problems to work through in order to prepare for an upcoming test, exam or review. However, as in most other subjects, note taking and journaling is also very effective and very important to help with the understanding of specific math concepts. Whether you dictate your notes and have them available for audio, or write your notes to review them visually, the strategies and tips here will help you better prepare for math tests and exams. Effective notes will help you to remember important concepts taught in class and they will guide you through various math problems.\n\nTaking Notes\n\nI prefer to use the two column approach in my notes and I also prefer to use pencil. To use the two column approach, your actual notes will be on one side and the examples or theorems/forumulas will be on the other. There is usually more than one method of solving a problem, use your notes to document this. Be sure to include any examples that you believe will help you later. Math is often about making connections as so many concepts are interrelated, be sure to record the connections you make. Areas where you have concerns or believe to be your greatest weakness are also the areas you should emphasize. To emphasize, you may wish to use a highligher and attach a few stickies. Personally, I prefer to date my notes as well, sometimes I include the text pages for handy reference.\n\nFormat\n\nI've already mentioned that it is helpful to keep audio notes, however, it is difficult to record examples of exercises in audio. Audio is better when you are reviewing postulates, procedures and formulas. The more you hear the explanations, the greater the chance you will retain the information. However, you may also wish to record your notes on your computer. I have used Microsoft One Note previously and found it quite effective. There is an add-in that allows you to perform calculations and to plot graphs and it contains an extensive collection of mathematical symbols and structures to display expressions and has a pretty good equation gallery. Two others I use are La-Tex, and Math Symbols. Although I like La Tex, it isn't my first choice for taking notes. Math Symbols is great for creating exercises and it allows you to create your equations quickly (newer version has handwriting recognition) but you'll still need another application to integrate it with. A lot of my students prefer One Note because it's where they keep all of their notes. However, everyone is different and you'll need a strategy that works best for you.\n\nTips for Improving Your Note Taking Skills\n\nListen carefully to your instructor and jot down the key points about solving problems, proving theorems or using a procedure. Write down everything you think that will help you when you return to this concept later.\n\nDon't get too wordy, keep your notes to the point and simple to understand.\n\nUse logical organization, jumping around from concept to concept will only be confusing. Make sure your examples have key points in your notes.\n\nExplain your reasoning. This component is key, keep it short and sweet but explain the logic behind the application or procedure.\n\nRecord alternate methods, as I mentioned earlier, there is usually more than one way to solve a problem, be sure to record the alternative methods.\n\nWhen taking notes in math, look at your textbook. What do you like about it? What don't you like about it? Think of your notes as a set of cheat notes for you to review. Make them look like a text that you find easy to follow.\n\nIn summary, most important of all is to review your notes in a timely way. Make review part of your routine. We are all guilty of cramming before tests and exams but a little review along the way will better equip you to see greater success in math. If journaling works better for you, you may wish to check out some strategies for effective math journaling.",

The organizers will try to provide a relaxed atmosphere with enough time for discussion.\n\nInteger programming is a field of optimization with recognized scientific and economical relevance. The usual approach to solve integer programming problems is to use linear programming within a branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut framework, using whenever possible polyhedral results about the set of feasible solutions.

In particular, polynomial algorithms for solving integer programs in fixed dimension have recently been developed.

Currently I'm studying computer science, and I'm interested in looking into statistical and optimization applications, as well as theory (yeah, I know that sound broad, but I'm quite early in my education!). Anyways, I want to get deep into the math behind these things - statistics, combinatorics, linear and integer programming, maybe some analysis. Algebra also interests me.</p>\n<p>I've found that math studies go okay, but from time to time I have trouble. Understanding delta-epsilon proofs was a big obstacle for calculus back in high school, and more recently generating functions have been giving me serious trouble.</p>\n<p>If I pursue a path towards graduate level studies, what sort of things should I watch out for? More generally, since I don't know where I'm going, what concepts did you find hardest to grasp during your undergrad/early graduate studies?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n by Wlog for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forWlog2009-10-25T17:37:06Z2009-10-25T17:37:06Z<p>I have advice, but it is dependent on the size of your university and/or the mathematics department therein.</p>\n<p>A large part of my undergraduate process was to tutor others in the class. A good test of your understanding is if you assist someone else in coming to the same understanding. Unfortunately, it may be that your class sizes are <em>epsilon</em>. Thus it will be more difficult to form a study group. Applied Functional Analysis is a topic of great importance for a young computer scientist, especially one who is aspiring for a PhD, but it can be slow to grasp if you are taking it as an independent reading course.</p>\n by Scott Morrison for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forScott Morrison2009-10-25T18:34:40Z2009-10-25T18:34:40Z<p>One general advice about early maths education is to not decide what you like too early!</p>\n<p>Keep learning new fields, keep reading books about things you don't know yet. Most mathematicians I know aren't working on problems they would have expected when they arrived in grad school. It takes a surprisingly long time for most people to reach the level of mathematical maturity where they're reading to work on new problems, and until you have an inkling that you're ready for this, don't overspecialise. There's plenty of time for that later!</p>\n by Elisha Peterson for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forElisha Peterson2009-10-27T23:14:33Z2009-10-27T23:14:33Z<p>My gut response is to say there are a limitless supply of these plateaus. There is so much out there that even the best mathematicians are limited in what they can understand well. So in terms of specific concept plateaus, well if you're like most of us you'll probably have lots of them, and that's a good thing.</p>\n<p>In terms of concepts, I think what I found tough was often much clearer after I lost an early misconception. E.g. for a long time I thought the Killing form in Lie algebra was using \"killing\" as a synonym for \"erasing\"... I tried to build my understanding around that conception and it didn't work very well (Killing is a name). A lot of \"simple\" mathematical ideas are known by proper names rather than descriptive terms, so as more of these accumulate you have to rely more on memorization than intuition.</p>\n<p>Outside of concepts, here's what I found tough:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transition from coursework to research.</strong> Some people are very good at getting the A when the material is put in front of them, and most textbooks are good at giving you the necessary tools to solve the problems they present. I found the transition to more open-ended problems a significant challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding the frontier of a field.</strong> As stated in a previous response, it's tough to get to the frontier of a field. It takes a lot of work, and a lot of time. So graduate school requires a lot of perseverance.</li>\n</ul>",

The first five chapters consist of a systematic development of many of the important properties of the real number system, plus detailed treatment of such concepts as mappings, sequences, limits, and continuity. The sixth and final chapter discusses metric spaces and generalizes many of the earlier concepts and results involving arbitrary metric spaces. An index of axioms and key theorems appears at the end of the book, and more than 300 problems amplify and supplement the material within the text. Geared toward students who have taken several semesters of basic calculus, this volume is an ideal prerequisite for mathematics majors preparing for a two-semester course in advanced calculus",

    "text": "Let me explain: one the one hand, linear algebra and calculus are enough to consider a lot of non-trivial problems and describe basic issues in many areas. On the other hand, the various areas of mathematics tend to interact intensely with each other, which is what makes math so cool. So it's going to be difficult to direct you to a specific area, since chances are that a reference that is advanced enough will not be shy about using much more advanced notions (check out the math articles on wikipedia to get an idea of what I mean; even innocuous sounding ones can get pretty intense).\n\nI do want to encourage you to give in to your curiosity: but instead of picking a specific subject, you would be much better off picking up specific references that are written more specifically for your level. There are many of those, look for general math books, e.g. from the AMS and MAA. \"Proofs from THE BOOK\" might be a bit intense, but roughly at the right level.\n\nSince the various areas of math tend to riff off each other as I mentioned, the last thing you want to do is get specialized too early anyway, so generalist books are better for you now.",

    "text": "Mathematics\n\n\"For the things of this world cannot be made known without a knowledge of mathematics. \" – Roger Bacon, philosopher\n\nBacon also said that, \"mathematics is the gate and key to the sciences.\" At St. George's, we believe the coalescence of math and science is necessary to create highly adept, numerically and scientifically literate students. An intentional and well-planned mathematics and science curriculum prepares St. George's students for an evolving and global world as well as for advanced study in college.\n\nAn integrated approach to the curriculum and its emphasis on technology seeks to combine mathematical concepts with concrete matters that are addressed in other areas of academic disciplines. High standards with regard to skill development and conceptual understanding are reinforced through project-based learning that encourages students to apply ideas in real-life settings. Through such integration the mathematical concepts being learned in the specific math classes are reinforced and enriched Students in Math 6—Honors delve deeper into topics than students in Math 6 through examining more applications and critical thinking exercises at a much faster pace The final trimester consists of students reading, analyzing, and writing about classic short stories, while honing their reading comprehension skills. Note: Same as course appearing in English section.\n\nPre-Algebra 7 prepares students for Algebra I and Geometry slope and y-intercept to graphs and linear expressions.

In Honors Pre-Algebra, visualization continues with consistent modeling of fractions, percents, mathematical operations, equations, probabilities, and algebraic expressions.\n\nIn Accelerated Algebra I, students begin learning how to use graphing calculators.\n\nIn Honors Honors Algebra I, students begin learning how to use graphing calculators. Students in Honors Algebra I delve deeper and cover topics more rapidly than students in Accelerated Algebra I Additionally, students are introduced to right triangle trigonometry and their applications in the real world. Honors students should expect a rapid pace and more in-depth coverage.\n\nAlgebra II focuses on the study of functions, their graphs, and their properties. Specific functions covered include linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic. However, Algebra II also touches on a wide variety of other topics including, but not limited to, solving higher order equations and inequalities, conics, and polynomial and rational expressions. Students develop a clear understanding of the relationship between algebraic equations and their graphs. All work revolves around the process of solving a problem and the mathematical concepts rather than just \"getting the answer.\" Problem solving through both traditional algebraic methods and graphical methods is an important component of the class.\n\nWhile Algebra II Honors is a continuation of the concepts learned in Algebra I, this course will introduce the student to some of the theory behind those concepts. Honors Algebra II emphasizes the strong and integral relationship between functions and their graphs. Students will solve problems both algebraically and graphically using pencil and paper as well as a graphing calculator. Students will be asked to think beyond calculations and contemplate the roots and the derivations of the topics. Honors Algebra II is a preparatory course for PreCalculus, Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry, Statistics, and Calculus. To that end, this course covers a variety of topics such as linear and nonlinear functions, relations and systems; exponents and logarithms; conics; rational functions; radical functions. Problem solving strategies as well as how concepts are applied will be emphasized throughout the course.\n\nThis course is designed to strengthen students' understanding of concepts taught in Algebra II. Students will focus on a deeper study of functions—analyzing equations, graphs and real-world applications—and the introduction of trigonometry topics needed in advanced mathematics courses. Students will collaborate to construct and share knowledge, building their confidence in mathematics and preparing them for courses in high school and College Algebra or Precalculus at the college level.\n\nThis is a functions-based course that both reinforces and broadens concepts taught in Algebra II, and introduces new concepts, preparing students for calculus matrices, series & sequence, analytic geometry and introductory calculus.\n\nThis is a functions-based course that both reinforces and broadens concepts taught in Algebra II, and introduces new concepts, preparing the students for AP Calculus BC series & sequence, limits and derivatives. Students should expect more independent work and a faster-paced experience.\n\nThis course is divided into three sections, calculus, discrete topics, and statistics. Students will experience the concepts of derivatives and integration through applications in calculus. Discrete mathematics is an umbrella of mathematical topics. Topics include game theory and social theory, which use math to discuss human behavior and its effects. The third component, statistics, will be learned as a tool used in decision making. Students will learn to gather, analyze, interpret and report their findings in a systematic and mathematical manner.\n\nAP Statistics is an introductory, non-calculus based college statistics course that emphasizes understanding and analyzing statistical studies. Students will explore the theory of probability, descriptions of statistical measurements, probability distributions, experimental design and statistical inference. Students will be analyzing samples and understanding populations on an ongoing basis. Graphing calculators are used throughout the course. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.\n\nAP Calculus AB is a college-level calculus course that is generally equivalent to a first semester college course: differentiation and integration of polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions. Calculators and computers are used to increase and strengthen the students' understanding of the concepts. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.\n\nAP Calculus BC is a college-level calculus course that is generally equivalent to the first two semesters of the college Calculus sequence all of the Calculus AB topics as well as additional topics, such as series and polar coordinates.

The calculator is a Scientific Programmable Calculator (usually people are concerned and do not like the math or advanced calculators). The idea is to give the problems with how to do, then they can just change the variables (where you put A= 5 - or some number and then all they need to do is change the variables - [the number where A=??] and it will work the problem. Or see how the calculator is programmed and write their own programs. The easier the calculator is to use, the more chance they will use it (the calculator is FREE).\n- How can I change it to make it better (all areas). You can download the calculator and use it (FREE). More examples will be posted as I get time.\n-\nThank You\nfalcon\n\nMy error. The site is the page Precise Calculator Manual (the link) The Calculator is the link in the banner 'Precise Calculator Download' also there is 'Precise Calculator Examples'. These should make it easier to use and understand. My goal is to make it easy, so anything that needs to be clarified is what I am looking for. I have been programming and setting up calculators (different makes and models) so I miss the concepts or areas that you don't understand because many I take for granted. Mostly using TI calculators and programming in Basic, But many free ones are able to achieve the same results and this is one of the better FREE ones and is easy to program and use (also is better than some expensive ones). I didn't write the calculator program, just trying to help students be able to use it to calculate some advanced math.\n-\nThank You\nfalcon\n\nGood idea! At this stage it's like BASIC with some buttons around.\nTo make really quick improvements, alter it's syntax:\n1. To automatically PRINT raw expressions (i.e. \"2+2\" line should print \"4\")\n2. To automatically ASK for unknown variables (i.e. \"2*X+5\" should ask with popup for X value and then print the result).\n\nIn general, you should do this as web service for people to calculate online and share common library of macroses.\n\nCheck top of page 'Related Articles' \"Download Precise Calculator\". There you should see many Macros that you can 'copy and paste' to the calculator and run. Then add to your stored Macros.

In addition, students will identify the x-intercepts and y-intercepts of each trinomial function and explore relationships between the trinomial x2 + bx + c and its factored form (x + m)(x + n). \"\n\n\"This activity uses a series of related arithmetic experiences to prompt students to generalize into more abstract ideas. In particular, students explore arithmetic statements leading to a result that is the factoring pattern for the difference of two squares. A geometric interpretation of the familiar formula is also included.\"\n\n\"This lesson provides students with an introduction to exponential functions. The class first explores the world population since 1650. Students then conduct a simulation in which a population grows at a random yet predictable rate. Both situations are examples of exponential growth.\"\n\n\"This lesson will teach students about several of the rules regarding exponents. It uses a situation from Alice in Wonderland in which Alice's height is doubled or reduced by half depending on what she consumes to introduce negative exponents and the rules for dividing powers.\"\n\n\"This lesson teaches students about direct variation by allowing them to explore a simulated oil spill using toilet paper tissues (to represent land) and drops of vegetable oil (to simulate a volume of oil).\"\n\n\"This lesson teaches students about inverse variation by exploring the relationship between the heights of a fixed amount of water poured into cylindrical containers of different sizes as compared to the area of the containers' bases.\"",

    "text": "Synopsis:Stuck On Algebra is a classroom-proven interactive Algebra workstation that keeps students on task doing traditional Algebra in a classic gaming model combining an unbending standard of proficiency with the forgiving and encouraging spirit of \"failure without consequence\". The result: steady improvement and repeated small successes, the addictive formula of video games without any dilution of the Algebra experience.\n\nBackground: SOA is the second generation of a system last sold in the early 90s. More than one educator who used that system in the 90s has sought me out in recent years to ask if it were still available. SOA is available now for beta testing here.\n\nSoftware In Brief: SOA offers: step-by-step guidance and correction of basic Algebra I problems entered by the student or generated by the application; solved solutions with explanations of generated problems; unassisted exams on a hierarchy of Algebra topics.\n\nTransformations SOA transforms learning mathematics in several important ways:\n\n1. Thanks to step-by-step checking, weak arithmetic skills do not prevent the learner from succeeding with Algebra. Those skills improve as mistakes are caught. The student must work to figure out what they did wrong and correct it. Progress is slower at first, but they are working on Algebra instead of yet another tedious worksheet of arithmetic, so the learner's motivation to persevere is strong.\n\n2. Assistance available in Training Modes lets students of any ability experience the pleasure of solving Algebra puzzles and enjoy math in its own right. They may make more mistakes getting there, but that only increases the satisfaction of finally succeeding and draws them into further study.\n\n3. With SOA correcting all the work, tracking student progress, and offering first-level assistance when students get stuck, the teacher has more time to work with students individually or in small groups.\n\n4. In Mission Mode learners must meet a fixed standard of mastery by passing unassisted, \"no second chance\" challenges. Missions become available only as prerequisite missions are passed, so the independent learner has a structure they can follow. For any student, Missions draw learners into ever more high-quality practice as they attempt repeatedly to pass the unassisted challenges, encouraged by getting closer each time to succeeding.\n\nSummary The system works for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Algebra is easy but there is a lot of it and it is cumulative. Algebra requires fluent application of many easy rules, which in turn requires a substantial quantity of high-quality practice to make those rules second-nature. With SOA students get more practice with ever-present feedback and assistance.\n\nSecond, Algebra is fun for any student as long as they are given the fighting chance to solve problems on their own. SOA's instant feedback, detailed hints, and solved examples give them that chance.\n\nThird, the stigma of failure is lifted without compromising the standard of proficiency that must be met. The satisfaction of small successes and evidence of steady improvement even as they fail at exams draws learners into further practice and eventual mastery. This is precisely the addictive formula of computer gaming.",

    "text": "Teaching Conic Sections\n\nTeaching Conic Sections\n\nSo I currently teach a precalc class and new this year we are required to teach conic section.\nWe cover parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Since I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it? The book we use has a bunch of formulas, but I'm looking for a way to teach it to my students without using all the formulas so they don't have to memorize a bunch of formulas before their exam. What has worked for others?\n\nYou should be able to design good lessons directly based on the book sections. As long as you use a Pre-Calculus book you will have rich enough information available.\n\nBe sure to demonstrate the conic sections using a realistic three-dimensional model. Also use the definitions of each conic section and the distance formula to derive the equation for each conic section, and include the analytical cartesian graph for each.\n\nYou are right on-target about not just giving a bunch of formulas. The demonstration and the derivations are important for learning and understanding.\n\nTeaching Conic Sections\n\nAs a student who struggled through conic sections, I found that by exploring how they were really just variations of the of the same things cemented my understanding of the topic. So if I were in your shoes I would try to show the similarities and differences of the different sections. Specifically between the hyperbola and parabola and the circle and ellipse.\n\nAs someone who not long ago learnt Conic Sections, I found the derivations of the formula much easier than remembering them. It was good to see the formulas at first but I much preferred the derivations.\n\nAs above said, use a 3D model as well. The 2D drawing didn't really do it justice for me.\n\nI was definitely going to derive the formulas using the distance formula and talk about applications. I wouldn't scratch formulas altogether, but our book has like 8 different formulas, which isn't fair to give all of them to my students if I don't give them on an exam.\n\nSomething one of my physics professors said to our class is recalled to me by this thread. He said students of today are so used to tv games, comics, etc. rather than playing with things with their hands, that they can't visualize 3d objects anymore. He was of course exaggerating. I think it quite odd if a student can't visualize what's going on with conic sections, so yes a model would be quite good. Maybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.\n\nAlso, the old books on geometry, particularly solid geometry, should be good with conic sections, so maybe go down to the library and have a look at them.\n\nAh yes, I have a fun experiment using that! You should certainly teach that!\n\nHere it goes: Dandelin was a Belgian, and some people decided to celebrate him. So what they did was the following. They made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone). And they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone. Then they would sell it to people.I always tought that it was very clever, and it was quite the financial succes too!did they then discover another, smaller, ice-cream (just like discovering another layer of chocolates when you finish the first layer!), which touched the other focus on the other side of the biscuit?",

    "text": "PUMP Algebra Curriculum Home Page\n\nThis page is very out of date and is currently being modified. In the\nmeantime, please go to Carnegie Learning to learn\nmore about currently available cognitive tutors for mathematics and\nwriting.\n\nWho are we?\n\nThe PUMP(Pittsburgh Urban Mathematics Project)\nAlgebra Project is a collaboration between the ACT\nResearch Group and the PACT\nCenter at Carnegie Mellon University, and a group of teachers\nin the Pittsburgh Public Schools. It is an attempt to make high school\nAlgebra accessible to all students through the use of situational curriculum\nmaterials and an intelligent computer based tutoring system.\n\nThe high school tutor and course materials are now called \"Cognitive\nTutor Algebra\" and are being marketed by the PACT Center's spin-off\ncompany, Carnegie\nLearning. The PACT Center is currently developing tutors for\nMiddle School math.\n\nThe development of Algebra throughout the curriculum is based on the\nstudents' own informal knowledge of mathematics and on problem situations.\nModelling situations such as the Nintendo Problem, shown above, students\nbegin to construct intuitive understandings of and connections between\nmultiple representations of functions. From the beginning of the course\nstudents are asked to make the connections between the various representations\nand to construct each representation based on their understanding of the\nproblem situation.\n\nA mere listing of topics covered does not adequately provide the necessary\nframework for the curriculum. Consequently, we use a matrix which attempts\nto show the development of the curriculum in a more meaningful way; however,\na three dimensional framework showing the multiple representations as the\ncore which expands from the first quadrant with simple direct variation\nto mx+b to all four quadrants to systems to data analysis to quadratics\nwould probably be more appropriate.\n\nCurrently students work in their regular classrooms three days a week on\nthe curriculum. The other two class periods are spent in the computer lab\nworking on the computer tutors. (See the PAT\ntutor). The classroom curriculum is reproduced for each student on\nloose-leaf notebook paper with space for them to write their responses\non the actual workbook. ALL answers must be written in complete sentences.\nHomework is also reproduced on loose-leaf. TI-81 scientific calculators\nare provided by the school for use in the classroom. Each student can be\nissued a scientific calculator to use on homework.\n\nThe U.S. Shirts\nProblem is a sample three day lesson module from the first quarter\nof the classroom curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to read over the problem\nsituation at the beginning of the period and then give the students time\nto work in cooperative groups to solve the problem. Groups are given overlays\nto describe the problem and asked to present their results to the rest\nof the class.\n\nLearning in Cooperative Groups\n\nThe PUMP project is committed not only to providing the opportunity\nfor all students to enroll in Algebra, but also to providing the students\nwith the human and technological support to enable them to be successful\nin Algebra. This support includes the computer tutors, the support of the\nChapter One reading specialist, after school tutoring, Family Algebra Nights,\nthe inclusion of Special Education students and teachers, support for the\nteachers including summer workshops and on-going help, and new assessment\nstrategies.\n\nFamily Algebra Night\n\nStudent assessment is a major area of emphasis. The first\nsemester final exam and the year\nend final exam from the1993-94 school year are presented to the new\nstudents at the beginning of the school year along with level 4 student\nresponses in order to clearly communicate our expectations to the students.\nStudents are assessed on their performance on group tasks in the classroom,\nindividual on demand performance tasks, portfolios, and their work on the\ncomputer tutors, as well as on more the traditional homework and tests.\nAt the end of each grading period students are given an individual on-demand\nperformance task similar to the situations that they have worked on in\nthe classroom. Each of these requires the student to do a mathematical\nanalysis of a situation and to produce a writen report based on their analysis.\nAt the end of the first and third grading periods, these tasks are graded\nby the individual teachers; but at the end of each semester these tasks\nare graded using the New\nStandards Type Grading Conference Model.",

    "text": "Welcome to Calculus! This semester will be a\nchallenging one for you, but hopefully, with my suggestions, you will be able\nto successfully get through this class!\n\nIn order to succeed, you will have to know some\nthings even before you walk into your Calculus classroom on the first\nday. First off, sit towards the front. If you do this, you will be\nforced to pay attention. Secondly, make sure you get to know the people\nthat sit around you. If you are outgoing, strive to know the majority of\nthe people in the class. This will make class time more enjoyable for you\nbut will also help you with your grades. If you have trouble with\nsomething, you will have a peer to ask for help out of class. Lastly,\nwhen your professor gives you the syllabus for the semester, start right\naway! Start to do some of the assigned problems. If they don't make\nany sense to you, at least read the material you will be going over in class\nthe next day thouroughly.\n\nThere have been many things that I have discovered\nover the course of the semester that could be of value to you. First,\nalways keep up with your assignments. Have your assignment done so that\nyou can follow along when your professor lectures about the topic. Some\nof the assigned problems will be difficult and you will not be able to\nunderstand them. When this comes up, make sure that you ask\nquestions. The best way is to ask questions while in class. If\nclass time runs out, do not just forget about the problems you had on the\nassignment, go in and ask your professor during his/her office hours. In\naddition to doing your assignments, take your own notes from the book.\nThis will help you to understand topics covered in lecture better. For\nme, this technique really worked. Once I began to take my own notes in addition\nto the notes I took from my professor's lecture, I did a lot better, especially\non my weekly quizzes. Lastly, everyone messes up sometimes. If you\nget a bad grade on a quiz or an exam, make sure you know all the mistakes you\nmade and why. Chances are, you will see problems that you had trouble\nwith on comprehensive tests. Learn from your mistakes, and you will do\nbetter the next time you have the opportunity.\n\nI hope some of my suggestions help you during your\nsemester in Calculus. Good luck!",

Crauder, Evans, Johnson, and Noell have found the answer: Help them become intelligent consumers of the quantitative data to which they are exposed every day—in the news, on TV, and on the Internet.\n\nIn an age of record credit card debt, opinion polls, and questionable statistics, too few students have mastered the basic mathematical concepts required to think about and evaluate data. Quantitative Literacy: Thinking Between the Lines develops the idea of rates of change as a key concept in helping students make good personal, financial, and political decisions.\n\nThe goal of Quantitative Literacy is a more informed generation of college students who think critically about the data provided to them, the images shown to them, the facts presented to them, and the offers made to them. Quantitative Literacy shows students the mathematics that matters to them: their bank account, their medical tests, their daily news feed. It also develops their mathematical thinking, helping them to understand the difference between truthful and misleading mathematical reporting.\n\nIt's All in the Examples…\n\nAfter taking your course and working with Quantitative Literacy, students will be equipped to think about and answer all of the following questions:\n\nWill the Atkins Diet really help me lose weight?\n\nHow do I use logic to get the best results from a Google search?\n\nIs the local carpet store trying to fool me into thinking their prices are lower because they quote price by the square foot instead of the square yard?\n\nHow far can I go on this tank of gas?\n\nHow do I interpret the results of my medical tests?\n\nHow can businesspeople and politicians use graphs and charts to mislead me?\n\nWill inflation affect my savings and the age at which I can retire?\n\nHow do I avoid getting tricked by a Ponzi scheme?\n\nI want to buy a new car in two years.

Traditional classroom students who miss classes and independent learners may have access to this project's lectures.\n\nObjective\n\nThese lesson learners are able to develop linear equations from few given points by calculating slopes and y-intercepts.\n\nProject Rationale/Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this project is to provide students who have missed classes a chance to catch up, to assist independent learners who might be in preparations of GED exams, and other online learners who wwould like to increase their math general knowledge. Additionally, this project is to support English Language Learners (ELL) who have difficulties keeping up with live lecture pace (Merryfield, 2003).\n\nWhy This project Was Put On YouTube?\n\nYouTube is an interesting media that attracts a huge number of Internet surfers. It was created in 2005; however, it had the third largest Internet traffic behind Google and Yahoo in 2009. Thefefore, it is an ideal means for distance learning (Bonk, 2009).\n\nWhy Asynchronous Communication Was Chosen?\n\nAsynchronous lectures are ideal in distance learn because they convenient for busy individuals who cannot afford to attend regular classes. In addition, they can access these lectures as many times as they like (Harism, 2000). Also asynchronous lectures are convenient for ELL because they cannot keep up with fast paced lectures, and they decode every word they hear in the lecture. At the time they complete processing the first few sentences of the lecture, the speaker may finish the speech or start talking about new materials (Merryfield, 2003). Many postsecondary and K-12 school institutions that implemented online courses and studies found that students learning online modestly perform better than students learning in classrooms (Means et al., 2010).\n\nReferences:\n\nBonk, C.

Code for many of the illustrations is included, and can be downloaded from the book's web site:  scientists, engineers, and even graphic designers seeking help in creating technical illustrations need look no further.\n\nMathematical Explorations with MATLAB examines the mathematics most frequently encountered in first-year university courses. A key feature of the book is its use of MATLAB, a popular and powerful software package. The book's emphasis is on understanding and investigating the mathematics by putting the mathematical tools into practice in a wide variety of modeling situations. Even readers who have no prior experience with MATLAB will gain fluency. The book covers a wide range of material: matrices, whole numbers, complex numbers, geometry of curves and families of lines, data analysis, random numbers and simulations, and differential equations from the basic mathematics. These lessons are applied to a rich variety of investigations and modeling problems, from sequences of real numbers to cafeteria queues, from card shuffling to models of fish growth. All extras to the standard MATLAB package are supplied on the World Wide Web.\n\nThe use of software packages to solve mathematical problems is becoming increasingly popular. This comprehensive book illustrates how Mathcad can be used to solve many mathematical tasks. It also provides the mathematical background for the Mathcad package. Practical Use of Mathcadcontains many solutions to basic mathematical tasks for engineering and natural science. It can be used both as a reference and tutorial manual for lecturers and students, and as a practical manual for engineers mathematicians and computer scientists. The latest version of Mathcad V.8 Professional for Windows 95/98 is used throughout.\n\nThis unique book provides a streamlined, self-contained and modern text for a one-semester mathematical methods course with an emphasis on concepts important from the application point of view. Part I of this book follows the \"paper and pencil\" presentation of mathematical methods that emphasizes fundamental understanding and geometrical intuition. In addition to a complete list of standard subjects, it introduces important, contemporary topics like nonlinear differential equations, chaos and solitons. Part II employs the Maple software to cover the same topics as in Part I in a computer oriented approach to instruction. Using Maple liberates students from laborious tasks while helping them to concentrate entirely on concepts and on better visualizing the mathematical content. The focus of the text is on key ideas and basic technical and geometric insights presented in a way that closely reflects how physicists and engineers actually think about mathematics.",
