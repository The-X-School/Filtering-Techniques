{"text":"Contents of the Mathematics Placement Test\n\nSince 1978, UW system faculty and Wisconsin high school teachers have been collaborating to develop a test for placing incoming students into college Mathematics courses. The current test includes four components: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. These components are available for each UW System campus to use according to its individual needs and resources. Each campus determines the appropriate scores for entry into specific courses. The purpose of this brochure is to introduce you to the test, describe the rationale behind its creation, and outline future plans for its continued development.\n\nBackground and Purpose of the Test\n\nIn 1978, following the publication of the UW System Basic Skills Task Force Report, members of Mathematics Department Faculties from UW System institutions met in Madison to discuss common entry-level curriculum problems. One problem most departments shared was how to effectively place incoming freshmen into an appropriate mathematics course. Placement procedures and tests varied from campus to campus and it seemed that some consistency was desirable. The decision was made to develop a System-wide test for placement into an introductory mathematics curriculum.\n\nThe committee that would begin this task would consist of representatives from any UW System Mathematics Department that chose to participate. The departments would select their representatives and participation would be strictly voluntary.\n\nThe first step in the project was to carefully analyze each of the individual curricula in the System and write a detailed set of prerequisite objectives for all courses prior to calculus. After this list was approved by all campuses, the committee began developing test items on the skills identified in their test objectives. Through a series of pilot administrations at area high schools and UW campuses, the committee obtained valuable information about how the individual items performed, and gained important insights into item writing strategies and techniques. Many items were refined or corrected, as necessary, and repiloted in an effort to improve their ability to distinguish between students with different levels of mathematical preparedness. After a sufficient number of high quality items had been developed, they were assembled into a complete test. The first operational form of the Mathematics Placement Test was administered in 1984.\n\nPlacement into college courses is the sole purpose of this test. The experienced teacher will quickly realize that many skills which are taught in the high school mathematics courses are not included in the test. This was by design, as the test is a tool to assist advisors in placing students into the best course in the university-level mathematics sequence. The questions on the test were specifically selected with this single purpose in mind. This means the test is not a measure of everything that is learned in high school Mathematics courses. The test was not designed to measure program success or to compare students from one high school with students from another. It should be viewed only as a tool to be used for placing students at the university level.\n\nAs a placement instrument, the test has to be easy enough to identify those students needing remedial help, yet it also has to be complex enough to identify those students who are ready for calculus. Scores have to be precise enough to allow placement into many different levels of university coursework. In addition, the test has to be efficient to score, since thousands of students each year need to have their results promptly reported. In order to meet these criteria, the test development committee selected a multiple-choice format. The items measure four different areas of mathematical competence: elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry. Each skill area has a different set of detailed objectives, carefully developed to best match university mathematics curricula across the University of Wisconsin System.\n\nEvery year, a new form of the Mathematics Placement Test is published, along with some new pilot items for each component of the test, and administered to all incoming Freshmen in the UW System. All items are subjected to a statistical review to identify which items effectively distinguish the students with the strongest mathematics skills or the weakest mathematics skills from the general population of students. Only the items which are most useful for differentiating among students are ever considered for use on a future form of the test.\n\nAlthough faculty cannot be considered disinterested observers, those who are familiar with the placement test feel that its quality is extremely high. The feeling among faculty at the participating UW institutions is that the test has helped enormously in placing students into appropriate courses. One of the strengths of the Mathematics Placement Test is that it is developed by faculty from throughout the University of Wisconsin System. Therefore, this test represents a UW System perspective with respect to the underlying skills that are necessary for success in our courses. One of the challenges, in this regard, is that the UW System campuses do not have a single Mathematics curriculum. Instead, each campus has its own curriculum and its own courses, which may or may not correspond well with courses on other UW campuses. To ensure that the placement test works well on each UW campus, each UW institution determines its own cutscores so as to optimize placement into its own Mathematics course sequence. Consequently, cutscores will vary from campus to campus as a result of curricular differences and student population differences. Also, on many campuses, the placement test is but one of several variables used for placing students, often also including ACT/SAT score, units of high school mathematics, and grades in high school mathematics courses.\n\nThe ability of this test to appropriately place students into courses rests in the quality of the match between test content and the institutional curricula at each UW campus. To ensure that the test mirrors the curriculum in introductory mathematics courses throughout UW System, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee has expanded to include one representative from most of the 14 UW institutions, as well as one Wisconsin high school mathematics teacher. This committee generally convenes twice each year to write and revise test items and discuss issues pertaining to test content and university curricula.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nOver the past few years, the Mathematics Placement Test has changed in several very important ways. Prior to the fall of 2000, the different campuses were combining items in different ways to form placement scores and make placement decisions. The particular set of items used by any one campus was selected to best match that campus' introductory curriculum. However, because campuses combined the test items in different ways, students who transferred from one UW institution to another often found themselves without valid placement scores and needing to retake the test. In 2000, the Mathematics Placement Test Development Committee agreed upon a common method for combining test objectives to create a uniform set of scores for reporting performance on the placement test. The three agreed-upon scores, one corresponding to each new objective, are labeled mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. These three scores are now used by all System institutions.\n\nHistorically, the Mathematics Placement Test has always been organized in three different sections, labeled A, B, and C. Students were instructed to take either sections A and B (which contained elementary and intermediate algebra) or sections B and C (which contained intermediate and college algebra and trigonometry), depending upon their mathematics background and desired college placement. However, our experience was that many students found it difficult to accurately assess their level of preparedness and would often take the wrong two sections. On most campuses, students who scored too high on the AB test or too low on the BC test could not be placed accurately and were required to retest with the appropriate two sections of the test. This was very inconvenient, both for the students and for the university's testing office. Beginning in the fall of 2002, the three different sections were shortened and combined, and all students were asked to complete the entire test. This has helped eliminate the confusion over which two sections to take and has reduced the number of students needing to retest.\n\nGeneral Characteristics of the Test\n\n1. All items are to be completed by all students. The items are roughly ordered from elementary to advanced. The expectation is that less prepared students will answer fewer questions correctly than more prepared students.\n\n2. The test consists entirely of multiple choice questions, each with five choices.\n\n4. The Mathematics Placement Test is designed as a test of skill and not speed. Ample time is allowed for most students to answer all questions. Ninety (90) minutes are allowed to complete the test.\n\n5. The mathematics basics component has a reliability of .85. The algebra component has a reliability of .90. The trigonometry component has a reliability of .85. For all three sections, items are selected of appropriate difficulty to provide useful information within the range of scores used for placement throughout the System campuses.\n\nTest Description\n\nThe Mathematics Test Development Committee decided on three broad categories of items: mathematics basics, algebra, and trigonometry. The entire Mathematics Placement Test is designed to be completed in 90 minutes, sufficient time for most students to complete the test.\n\nItems for each of the three components are selected to conform to a carefully created set of detailed objectives. The percentage of items selected from each component are shown in Table 1 below.\n\nSample Items from the Trigonometry Component\n\nSample Trigonometry Items\n\nSample Geometry Items\n\nAdditional Statements About High School Preparation for College Mathematics Study\n\nCALCULUS\n\nThe number of high schools offering some version of calculus has increased markedly since the UW System Math Test Committee's first statement of objectives and philosophy, and experience with these courses has shown the validity of the Committee's original position. This position was that a high school calculus program may work either to the advantage or to the disadvantage of students depending on the nature of the students and the program. Today, it seems necessary to mention the negative possibilities first.\n\nA high school calculus program not designed to generate college calculus credit is likely to mathematically disadvantage students who go on to college. This is true for all such students whose college program entails use of mathematics skills, and particularly true of students whose college program involves calculus. High school programs of this type tend to be associated with curtailed or superficial preparation at the precalculus level and their students tend to have algebra deficiencies which hamper them not only in mathematics courses but in other courses in which mathematics is used.\n\nThe positive side is that a well-conceived high school calculus course which generates college calculus credit for its successful students will provide a mathematical advantage to students who go on to college. A study by the Mathematical Association of America identified the following features of successful high school calculus programs:\n\n1. they are open only to interested students who have completed the standard four year college preparatory sequence. A choice of mathematics options is available to students who have completed this sequence at the start of their senior year.\n\n2. they are full year courses taught at the college level in terms of text, syllabus, depth and rigor.\n\n3. their instructors have had good mathematical preparation (e.g. at least one semester of junior/senior level real analysis) and are provided with additional preparation time.\n\n4. instructors expect that their successful graduates will not repeat the course in college, but will get college credit for it.\n\nA variety of special arrangements exist whereby successful graduates of a high school calculus course may obtain credit at one or another college. A generally accepted method is for the students to take the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board. Success rates of students on this exam can be a good tool for evaluation of the success of a high school calculus course.\n\nGEOMETRY\n\nThe range of objectives in this document represents a small portion of the objectives of the traditional high school geometry course. The algebra objectives represent a substantial portion of the objectives of traditional high school algebra courses. The imbalance of test objectives can be explained in part by the nature of the entry level mathematics courses available at most colleges. The first college mathematics course generally will be either calculus or some level of algebra. A choice is usually based on three factors: (1) high school background; (2) placement test results; (3) curricular objectives. One reason for the emphasis on algebra in this document and on the test is that virtually all college placement decisions involve placement into a course which is more algebraic than geometric in character.\n\nStill, there are reasons for maintaining a geometry course as an essential component in a college preparatory program. Since there are no entry level courses in geometry at the college level, it is essential that students master geometry objectives while in high school. High school geometry contributes to a level of mathematical maturity which is important for success in college.\n\nLOGIC\n\nStudents should have the ability to use logic within a mathematical context, rather than the ability to do symbolic logic. The elements of logic which are particularly important include:\n\n1. Use of the connectives \"and' and \"or\" plus the \"negation\" of resultant statements, and recognition of the attendant relationship with the set operations \"intersection,\" \"union,\" and \"complementation.\"\n\n2. Interpretation of conditional statements of the form \"if P then Q,\" including the recognition of converse and contrapositive.\n\n3. Recognition that a general statement cannot be established by checking specific instances (unless the domain is finite), but that a general statement can be disproved by finding a single counter example. This should not discourage students from trying specific instances of a general statement to conjecture about its truth value.\n\nMoreover, logical thinking or logical reasoning as a method should permeate the entire curriculum. In this sense, logic cannot be restricted to a single topic or emphasized only in proof-based courses. Logical reasoning should be explicitly taught and practiced in the context of all topics. From this, students should learn that forgotten formulas can be recovered by reasoning from basic principles, and that unfamiliar or complex problems can be solved in a similar way.\n\nAlthough only two of the objectives explicitly refer to logic, the importance of logical thinking as a curriculum goal is not diminished. This goal, as well as other broad-based goals, is to be pursued despite the fact that it is not readily measured on placement tests.\n\nPROBLEM SOLVING\n\nProblem solving involves the definition and analysis of a problem together with the selecting and combining of mathematical ideas leading to a solution. Ideally, a complete set of problem solving skills would appear in the list of objectives. The fact that only a few problem solving objectives appear in the list does not diminish the importance of problem solving in the high school curriculum. The limitations of the multiple choice format preclude the testing of higher level problem solving skills.\n\nMATHEMATICS ACROSS THE CURRICULUM\n\nMathematics is a basic skill of equal importance with reading, writing, and speaking. If basic skills are to be considered important and mastered by students, they must be encouraged and reinforced throughout the curriculum. Support for mathematics in other subject areas should include:\n\n– a positive attitude toward mathematics\n\n– attention to correct reasoning and the principles of logic\n\n– use of quantitative skills\n\n– application of mathematics curriculum.\n\nCOMPUTERS IN THE CURRICULUM\n\nThe impact of the computer on daily life is apparent, and consequently many high schools have instituted courses dealing with computer skills. While the learning of computer skills is important, computer courses should not be construed as replacements for mathematics courses.\n\nCALCULATORS\n\nThere are occasions in college math courses when calculators are useful or even necessary (for example, to find values of trig functions), so students should be able to use calculators at a level consistent with the level at which they are studying mathematics (four-function calculators initially, scientific calculators in pre-calculus). A more compelling reason for being able to use calculators is that they will be needed in other courses involving applications of mathematics. The ability to use a calculator is very definitely a part of college preparation.\n\nOn the other hand, students need to be able to rapidly supply from their heads – whether by calculation or from memory – basic arithmetic, in order to be able to follow mathematical explanations. They should also know the conventional priority of arithmetic operations and be able to deal with grouping symbols in their heads. For example, students should know that (-3)2 s is 9, that -32 is -9, and that (-3)3 is -27 without needing to push buttons on their calculators. Moreover, students should be able to do enough mental estimation to check whether the results obtained via calculator are approximately correct.\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1991, the use of scientific calculators has been allowed on the UW Mathematics Placement Test. The test was redesigned to accommodate the use of scientific calculators, so as to minimize the effects on placement due to the use or nonuse of calculators. Exact numbers such as π, continue to appear in both questions and answers where appropriate.\n\nUse of scientific, non-graphing calculators is optional. Each student is advised to use or not use a calculator in a manner consistent with his or her prior classroom experience. Calculators will not be supplied at the test sites.\n\nMathematics curricula and faculty throughout UW are divided on whether or not to permit graphing calculators in classrooms. There remain many college-level courses for which graphing calculators are not allowed. Therefore, the placement test has not been revised to accommodate the use of graphing calculators. Students may not use graphing calculators for the Mathematics Placement Test.\n\nPROBABILITY AND STATISTICS\n\nAlthough university curricula are somewhat in a state of flux, with many basic issues and philosophies being examined, the normal entry level courses in mathematics remain the traditional algebra and calculus courses. Therefore, the placement tests must reflect those skills which are necessary for success in these courses. This is not intended to imply that courses stressing topics other than algebra and geometry are not vital to the high school mathematics curriculum, but rather that those topics do not assist in placing students in the traditional university entry level courses.\n\nProbability and statistics are topics of value in the mathematical training of young people today that are not reflected on the placement test. It is the Committee's feeling that these topics are important to the elementary and secondary curriculum. They are gaining significance on university campuses, both within mathematics departments and within those departments not normally thought of as being quantitative in nature. The social sciences are seeking mathematical models to apply, and in general these models tend to be probabilistic or statistical. As a result, the curriculum in these areas is becoming heavily permeated with probability and statistics.\n\nMathematics departments are finding many of their graduates going into jobs utilizing computer science or statistics. Consequently, their curricula are beginning to reflect these trends. The Committee urges the educational community to develop and maintain meaningful instruction in probability and statistics.\n\nHow Teachers Can Help Students Prepare for the Test\n\nThe best way to prepare students for the placement tests is to offer a solid mathematics curriculum and to encourage students to take four years of college preparatory mathematics. We do not advise any special test preparation, as we have found that students who are prepared specifically for this test, either by practice sessions or the use of supplementary materials, score artificially high. Often such students are placed into a higher level course than their background dictates, resulting in these students either failing or being forced to drop the course. Due to enrollment difficulties on many campuses, students are unable to transfer into a more appropriate course after the semester has begun.\n\nSignificant factors in the placement level of a student are the high school courses taken as well as whether or not mathematics was taken in the senior year. Data indicate that four years of college preparatory mathematics in high school not only raises the entry level mathematics course, but predicts success in other areas as well, including the ability to graduate from college in four years.\n\nTeachers should certainly feel free to encourage students to be well-rested and try to remain as relaxed as possible during the test. We intend that the experience be an enjoyable, yet challenging one. Remember that the test is designed to measure students at many different levels of mathematical preparedness; all students are not expected to answer all items correctly. There is no penalty for guessing, and intelligent guessing will most likely help students achieve a higher score.\n\nUse of the Tests\n\nWhen the UW System Mathematics Placement Tests were developed, they were written to be used strictly as a tool to aid in the most appropriate placement of students. They were not designed to compare students, to evaluate high schools or to dictate curriculum. The way an institution chooses to use the test to place students is a decision made by each institution. The Center for Placement Testing can and does help institutions with these decisions.\n\nEach campus will continue to analyze and modify its curriculum and hence will continue to modify the way in which it uses the placement tests to place students. Cutoff scores might need to be changed over time to reflect the prerequisites for a campus' curriculum. It is also important for follow-up studies to be made to determine the effectiveness of the placement procedures. Contact must be maintained with the high schools so that modifications in the curriculum in both the high schools and in the UW System can be discussed.","id":"/6","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9402660727500916,"__label__0":0.059753913432359695}}

{"text":"The Mathematics Department is committed to expanding students' understanding and appreciation of mathematics through a comprehensive, content-based plan that acknowledges and addresses differences in motivation, goals, ability, and learning styles. All students must complete three years of mathematics and pass a Regents examination.\nAll mathematics courses are year-long courses.\n\nCourse Offerings\n\nIntegrated Algebra - This is the first mathematics course in high school. The completion of this course -- 1 to 2 years -- depends on the entry level of the student. Algebra provides tools and develops ways of thinking that are necessary for solving problems in a wide variety of disciplines such as science, business, and fine arts. Linear equations, quadratic functions, absolute value, and exponential functions are studied. Coordinate geometry is integrated into this course as well as data analysis, including measures of central tendency and lines of best fit. Elementary probability, right triangle trigonometry, and set theory complete the course. Students will take the Integrated Algebra Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nGeometry - This is the second course in mathematics for high school students. In this course, students will have the opportunity to make conjectures about geometric situations and prove in a variety of ways that their conclusion follows logically from their hypothesis. Congruence and similarity of triangles will be established using appropriate theorems. Transformations including rotations, reflections, translations, and dilations will be taught. Properties of triangles, quadrilaterals and circles will be examined. Geometry is meant to lead students to an understanding that reasoning and proof are fundamental aspects of mathematics. Students will take the Geometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nAlgebra 2 and Trigonometry - This is the third of the three courses in high school mathematics. In this course, the number system will be extended to include imaginary and complex numbers. Students will learn about polynomial, absolute value, radical, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Problem situations involving direct and indirect variation will be solved. Data analysis will be extended to include measures of dispersion and the analysis of regression models. Arithmetic and geometric sequences will be evaluated. Binomial expressions will provide the basis for the study of probability theory, and the normal probability distribution will be analyzed. Right triangle trigonometry will be expanded to include the investigation of circular functions. The course will conclude with problems requiring the use of trigonometric equations and identities. Students will take the Algebra 2 and Trigonometry Regents examination at the conclusion of this course.\n\nCalculus - This course includes an overview of analytic geometry and trigonometry as it applies to the study of functions, graph limits, derivatives and their applications.\n\nCalculus AB, Advanced Placement - This is a full-year course in college-level calculus that culminates in the Advanced Placement (AB) examination. Included is the study of functions, graphs, and limits, derivatives, applications of derivatives, integrals, applications of integrals, the fundamental theorem of calculus, anti-differentiation, applications of the anti-derivative, and slope fields.\n\nCalculus BC, Advanced Placement - This is a full-year course in college-level calculus that culminates in the Advanced Placement (BC) examination. Included is the study of: additional techniques for integration, calculus with parametric equations and polar equations, infinite series, and Taylor and Maclaurin series.","id":"/20","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.952811062335968,"__label__0":0.04720896854996681}}

{"text":"Math Anxiety\n\nThroughout grade school and maybe even in high school, many students felt there was no reason to take math.\n\nThese students hated math and felt they were never going to use it. There is still the tendency to think that only those who go into technical fields need math. Math teaches us to think. Math helps us to organize or thoughts, analyze information, and better understand the world around us.\n\nThere are myths about math that we have accepted as true and these tend to hold us back when it comes to learning math.\n\nSome popular myths are:\n\nFemales aren't any good at math\n\nThe majority can't do well in math because only a few people really have mathematical minds. (We are happy to get a \"C\" in math whereas we won't accept a \"C\" in English or any other subject that we like. We expect to do poorly in math).\n\nSome hints for studying math:\n\nRead your text first, before you try any problems.\n\nWrite down the theorems and definitions, read them out loud, and then rewrite them into your own words.\n\nDo a lot of problems and practice tests.\n\nDon't cram for tests. Frequent practice and review is the key to learning math. If you cram, you will be unsure of yourself. Formulas will become confused and problems will look differently.\n\nDon't keep looking in the back of your debt at the answers a. You may have the right answer but may not have done the problem correctly. b. If you have the wrong answer, it could affect your confidence and concentration.\n\nWhen you aren't sure of a problem, ask for help, but never erase your work. Even if the problem is wrong, find to where you were wrong and where you were right. You can learn just as much from your mistakes as from what you've done correctly.\n\nSet aside a certain time everyday to study math.\n\nGet extra help when you need it. Come to the PLC for tutoring; ask your teacher or a classmate for help. Remember, you need to understand math; that does not mean memorizing it.\n\nBegin at the right place. If you feel that you need a review, be sure to start with a math class that begins at your level.\n\nA common story instructors hear from math students is that the students can do the work or homework and in class but when it comes down to the test, the students freeze.\n\nThe number one problem of math test anxiety is negative self-talk. Negative self-talk is when you talk yourself deeper into anxiety. You think \"what if\" or \"I can't\". You worry about finishing the test on time. You tend to concentrate on how you are feeling, on how the anxiety is affecting you instead of on the test itself.\n\nSome hints to counteract math test anxiety:\n\nConfront your anxiety by admitting that you are worried about this test. Anxiety and fear react in the body in the same way, and admitting that you re anxious relieves some of the anxiety.\n\nUse positive self-talk. Keep telling yourself that you can do this math, that you know this stuff, and that you are prepared.\n\nControl your physical self. Take a brisk walk around the classroom buildings using positive self-talk while walking. Keep your heart rate and respiration steady by doing slow, five count deep breathing exercises. Loosen tight muscles on your neck by doing shoulder rolls forward and backward. Relax legs and arms by shake outs before you walk into the classroom.\n\nFocus your attention away from yourself and towards the problem.\n\nWhen taking practice tests or working on homework, keep a diary of the kinds of thoughts you are having while working out the problems. Relate these concerns to your tutor or teacher.\n\nWhile the above suggestions will be helpful for the physical and emotional self, the following suggestions may be beneficial for the academic self.\n\nSome hints to better test taking:\n\nWrite down formulas and other memorized information directly onto the test. This eliminates the risk of forgetting or altering the information incorrectly as you work the problems.\n\nPreview the test. Find a problem you are comfortable with and start there. It is not necessary to work in numerical order. Try instead to choose an order that helps you stay positive.\n\nStart with the easier problems. Also keep in mind the total point of the test and plan a strategy to get the most amount of points possible in the shortest amount of time.\n\nPass over difficult problems. Give yourself a certain time limit to solve it; if more time is needed, circle the number and come back to it later. Use the strategy you've planned and remain positive. If you find yourself becoming anxious, try some relaxation techniques to calm down physically and then focus back on the test.\n\nReview the problems you've skipped. Maybe other problems you have solved can give you a better insight to the work needed for this problem.\n\nShow some work for each problem, even if it's a guess. Partial credit is still good.\n\nAllow for some time to look back over your work. Make sure you have read the directions correctly and look for careless errors.\n\nUse all of the test time. Anxiety can induce a need to escape. Try to control the anxiety before this feeling takes over. Leaving a test early may mean a loss of points on your test as well as other negative feedback. Remember, always try to remain positive.\n\nRemember, the key to conquering math anxiety is practice, practice, practice. The more confident you become in your ability, the better you will do.","id":"/25","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9486722946166992,"__label__0":0.051347702741622925}}

{"text":"GOOD COURSES\n\nCONTENTS\n\nI. Undergraduate mathematics\n\nA discussion of what a good undergrad programme in\nmathematics should be about can be found here.\nThe book concerns mathematics in the American system, where applied\nmathematics was\nrarely taught in maths departments (at the time of writing). It also\ndiscusses the content often presented in four-year American liberal arts\ncolleges, and two-year community colleges, and criticises the specialist\nnature of the topics\nchosen. The courses offered to students of science and engineering by\ndepartments of mathematics are also panned, one point being that the\nprofessor doing this job knows no science or engineering at all.\n\nThe author, Morris Kline, talks of the research professor, who hates\nteaching undergraduates of any sort, and also mentions the wide use made\nof graduate student tutors, who have neither training nor\nexperience. Scarce mention is made of full, associate and assistant\nprofessors, who form (in my experience) the bulk of the academic staff in\nmost departments of mathematics in American universities, and who do a\nvery professional job in their teaching, as well as research and admin.\n\nSome of the criticism of present methodology is way off centre. For\nexample, Kline objects to the teaching of applied mathematics by using\nover-simplified models. He argues that there is no point teaching the laws\nof falling bodies as if there were no air friction: tell that to a\nparachutist, he quips. In this he fails to capture the essence of\nscience: we must study models, and compare with experiment, so that we may\nshoot them down, and revise them. More, we can usually find a range of\napplicability of\nthe simple model, outside of which it is no longer a good one. But\nworse: he seems to be saying that only a fully developed, correct model\nshould be taught. This goes against the teaching of Picasso: a teacher\nshould mix a little bit of what we do not know with a lot of what we do\nknow. I taught physics at Virginia Tech., a course in which the technician\nhad prepared the \"Galileo Bench\". This was an inclined plane on an air\ncushion, in which Galileo's laws of falling bodies, s = s(0) + vt + 1/2 at2,\nwas true, to within the experimental error. Some of the students\nfound these laws hard to understand, even without friction. When they had achieved\nthat, we went on to the refinements coming from friction. To start with\nthe full theory, would place them in a similar position to Galileo... who\nhad to cope with Aristotle's dictum that a force was needed to keep a\nbody moving; when Galileo had abandoned this, he broke the 2000 year stalemate\nin science.\n\nMost of the points made about the limited syllabus of a maths degree do\nnot apply to the UK, where applied\nmathematics traditionally forms half of the degree in\nmathematics. However, with the possible replacement of A-levels with a\nbacc., our school programme might become more like the American one. We\nshould then think about whether the university course might also move in\nthat direction. Should we have four-year degree courses in mathematics, with\nthe first year devoted to maths, physics, chemistry and computing? These\ncould cover the four subjects to replace the omitted parts of A-level. The\nmathematics course\ncould cover analytic geometry with calculus, trig, probability and\nstatistics,\ncomplex numbers, and vectors, with a little theory of matrices.\nPhysics could include Newton's laws, with examples from one\ndimension, such as motion under constant gravity, friction,\nsimple damped oscillator, sinusoidal wave\nmotion, interference of waves, the laws of thermodynamics, Eulerian fluid equations,\nand electricity and magnetism (before Maxwell). Chemistry might contain\nthe Bohr atom, the Mendeleev table, the inorganic chemistry of\nacids and bases, salts and metals. Some physical chemistry such as the law\nof mass-action, and some organic chemistry, should be\nincluded. Lab work in physics and chemistry should be at the\nlevel now done in schools in the UK. Computing might introduce a useful\nlanguage such as Java, Maple or Mathematica, and should give a general\ncompetence in Windows.\n\nKline suggests that scholarship in mathematics would serve a purpose,\nto reduce the number of pointless and empty papers, by critical reviews.\nThis used to be the job of Mathematical Reviews, until it changed its\npolicy, and now bans controversy in the reviews. Kline suggests that a new\ndegree of high status, Doctor in Arts, should be awarded, which would not\nrequire\noriginal theorems, but would be readable and deep. We have something\nsimilar, in\nthe M. Phil., which however has not got the status of the Ph. D.\n\nIII.Abstract Algebra\n\nIV. Graph theory\n\nV. The Kentucky Archives on\nMathematics\n\nThe site of the University\nof Kentucky hosts a list of free material on mathematics, of which\nIII. above is just one. I found the course on partial\ndifferential equations very useful. The course\non Hilbert Space Methods for Partial Differential Equations, by\nR. E. Showalter, is very pleasant indeed. It is slightly informal in its\ndefinition\nof distributions, but this is all that is needed for partial\ndifferential equations at this level.\n\nVI.Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia is a free internet\nencyclopaedia, written by its viewers. There\nis quite a large set of mathematics pages, as well as pages on physics and\nother sciences, and all other subjects. Some pages are sketchy, and others\nare literally empty,\nawaiting the first volunteer. I found a mistake in Wightman's\nbiography: it said he was British. I was able to edit that page and\ncorrect it. The statement of the Navier-Stokes equations could not be\nright, as the terms do not all have the same physical dimension.\n\nThe site is worth a browse, and might become more reliable as time\npasses.","id":"/27","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9747687578201294,"__label__0":0.02525130659341812}}

{"text":"The story of geometry is the story of mathematics itself: Euclidean geometry was the first branch of mathematics to be systematically studied and placed on a firm logical foundation, and it is the prototype for the axiomatic method that lies at the foundation of modern mathematics. It has been taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought.\n\nThis book tells the story of how the axiomatic method has progressed from Euclid's time to ours, as a way of understanding what mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics has achieved the level of certainty it has. It is designed primarily for advanced undergraduates who plan to teach secondary school geometry, but it should also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand geometry and the axiomatic method better. It introduces a modern, rigorous, axiomatic treatment of Euclidean and (to a lesser extent) non-Euclidean geometries, offering students ample opportunities to practice reading and writing proofs while at the same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers will need to know in the classroom.\n\nReadership\n\nUndergraduate students interested in geometry and secondary mathematics teaching.\n\nReviews\n\n\"Lee's \"Axiomatic Geometry\" gives a detailed, rigorous development of plane Euclidean geometry using a set of axioms based on the real numbers. It is suitable for an undergraduate college geometry course, and since it covers most of the topics normally taught in American high school geometry, it would be excellent preparation for future high school teachers. There is a brief treatment of the non-Euclidean hyperbolic plane at the end.\"\n\n-- Robin Hartshorne, University of California, Berkeley\n\n\"The goal of Lee's well-written book is to explain the axiomatic method and its role in modern mathematics, and especially in geometry. Beginning with a discussion (and a critique) of Euclid's elements, the author gradually introduces and explains a set of axioms sufficient to provide a rigorous foundation for Euclidean plane geometry.\n\n\"Because they assume properties of the real numbers, Lee's axioms are fairly intuitive, and this results in a presentation that should be accessible to upper level undergraduate mathematics students. Although the pace is leisurely at first, this book contains a surprising amount of material, some of which can be found among the many exercises. Included are discussions of basic trigonometry, hyperbolic geometry and an extensive treatment of compass and straightedge constructions.\"\n\n-- I. Martin Isaacs, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\n\"Jack Lee's book will be extremely valuable for future high school math teachers. It is perfectly designed for students just learning to write proofs; complete beginners can use the appendices to get started, while more experienced students can jump right in. The axioms, definitions, and theorems are developed meticulously, and the book culminates in several chapters on hyperbolic geometry--a lot of fun, and a nice capstone to a two-quarter course on axiomatic geometry.\"","id":"/32","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9242771863937378,"__label__0":0.07574288547039032}}

{"text":"Post navigation\n\nReading Math\n\nMy Algebra II kids don't like to read the textbook. Heck, neither do my calculus students. This isn't surprising. It's extra work and it's hard. My class also makes it hard for them, because I do not use the textbook as a skeletal structure for the course. I teach mainly out of my own materials, and use the book more as a supplement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I don't want them reading math. Kids are never taught to \"read\" a math textbook. If they ever do approach a math textbook, they approach it like a history book. The read it linearly. They also read it passively. Their eyes glaze over. They read words, but they don't try to connect the words to the equations or pictures. They don't read with a pencil in their hands. They hope for some Divine Knowledge to descend upon them simply by having the book open and their eyes on it.\n\nThat doesn't work. We all know this. Reading math is an active thing.\n\nAnd so recently I've started talking with my class about it. To start this process/discussion, one that I hope continues, I gave my students a worksheet to fill out (see above). I love the honesty with which they responded.\n\nFor question A, some representative responses:\n\n\"I read what was assigned to me but did not read anything extra.\"\n\"I find that textbook reading is pretty boring, so I don't do it unless I have to.\"\n\"I did not because I had assumed I wouldn't learn things I needed. All I would do was look at examples.\"\n\"No, I find it difficult to understand math when reading it in paragraphs; it makes more sense to me with a teacher.\"\n\"I did not generally read my math textbooks. I did, however, always look over the example problems.\"\n\nSome responses for Question B:\n\n1. The writing can be confusing, wordy, and not thorough\n2. The book is BORING\n3. Small print\n4. Too many words for math\n5. Outdated examples\n\nSome responses for Question C\n\n1. Everything is all in one place\n2. Have a glossary\n3. Can read at own pace; refer pack to the text when I get stuck\n4. Sidenotes! Diagrams! Pictures\n5. Real life examples\n6. Definitions clear\n7. Key terms are highlighted\n8. Wide range of example problems with step by step instructions\n9. Colors!\n\nI hope to do more as we go along. I might have them learn on their own, using the textbook (and the online video help) a whole section or two. There's no reason they can't learn to use the book to be independent learners. I will give them class time and photocopies of the section they need to learn, and they will have to figure things out by the end of the class for a 3 question quiz.\n\nI also hope that by the end of the year, we can use their critique of math textbooks for them to write their own textbook. Okay, okay, not quite. That's way too ambitious for me. Two years ago I had my Algebra II kids write really comprehensive Study Guides for the final exam. This year I might ask my kids to pick some of the hardest material and create their own \"textbook\" for it. They'll get to write it in pairs, and then they can share their finished product with the rest of the class. That will probably happen in the 3rd for 4th quarter.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share. Since I like to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication to my kids (though I don't do it nearly enough), I thought I'd talk about this one additional component in addition to getting students to talk and write math… READING MATH!\n\nPost navigation\n\n3 thoughts on \"Reading Math\"\n\nI found that reading \"How to read a book\" by Mortimer J Adler really helped me learn how to read a book I intended (or needed to) learn from. Most people (according to the book, and I agree) never learn to read beyond an elementary level, and this book teaches you how to read at a higher level. Works really well when you start using the techniques and such while reading the book. I'd encourage you to check it out.\n\nMy son has learned most of his math from reading books—he finds classroom instruction excruciatingly slow and has a hard time staying alert. He does sometimes need an explanation different from the one in the book, which (so far) I've been able to provide for him. Unlike your students, he finds the colors, sidebars, and gratuitous pictures distracting rather than helpful. So far, the best books for him have been from the Art of Problem Solving series, which have very clear but concise explanations.\n\nI think that reading speed makes a big difference: kids who read slower than talking speed have a harder time gathering information from books than from oral presentation.\n\nI still remember that linear algebra class I took at the local college. The prof taught the value of sloooooow reading. (it ruined his ability to read a novel at a fast pace) I turned this into a lesson.","id":"/46","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9573869705200195,"__label__0":0.042633023113012314}}

{"text":"Syllabus Structure and Content\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe way in which the mathematical content in the syllabuses is organised and presented in the syllabus document is described in sections 3.2 and 3.3. Section 3.3 also discusses the main alterations, both in content and in emphasis, with respect to the preceding versions. The forthcoming changes in the primary curriculum, which will have \"knock-on\" effects at second level, are outlined in Section 3.4. Finally, in Section 3.5, the content is related to the aims of the syllabuses.\n\n3.2 STRUCTURE\n\nFor the Higher and Ordinary level syllabuses, the mathematical material forming the content is divided into eight sections, as follows:\n\nSets\n\nNumber systems\n\nApplied arithmetic and measure\n\nAlgebra\n\nStatistics\n\nGeometry\n\nTrigonometry\n\nFunctions and graphs\n\nThe corresponding material for the Foundation level syllabus is divided into seven sections; there are minor differences in the sequence and headings, resulting in the following list:\n\nSets\n\nNumber systems\n\nApplied arithmetic and measure\n\nStatistics and data handling\n\nAlgebra\n\nRelations, functions and graphs\n\nGeometry\n\nThe listing by content area is intended to give mathematical coherence to the syllabuses, and to help teachers locate specific topics (or check that topics are not listed). The content areas are reasonably distinct, indicating topics with different historical roots and different main areas of application. However, they are inter-related and interdependent, and it is not intended that topics would be dealt with in total isolation from each other. Also, while the seven or eight areas, and the contents within each area, are presented in a logical sequence ­ combining, as far as possible, a sensible mathematical order with a developmental one for learners ­ it is envisaged that many content areas listed later in the syllabus would be introduced before or alongside those listed earlier. (For example, geometry appears near the end of the list, but the course committee specifically recommends that introductory geometrical work is started in First Year, allowing plenty of time for the ideas to be developed in a concrete way, and thoroughly understood, before the more abstract elements are introduced.) However, the different order of listing for the Foundation level syllabus does reflect a suggestion that the introduction of some topics (notably formal algebra) might be delayed. Some of these points are taken up in Section 4.\n\nAppropriate pacing of the syllabus content over the three years of the junior cycle is a challenge. Decisions have to be made at class or school level. Some of the factors affecting the decisions are addressed in these Guidelines in Section 4, under the heading of planning and organisation.\n\n3.3 SYLLABUS CONTENT\n\nThe contents of the Higher, Ordinary and Foundation level syllabuses are set out in the corresponding sections of the syllabus document. In each case, the content is presented in the two-column format used for the Leaving Certificate syllabuses introduced in the 1990s, with the lefthand column listing the topics and the right-hand column adding notes (for instance, providing illustrative examples, or highlighting specific aspects of the topics which are included or excluded). Further illustration of the depth of treatment of topics is given in Section 5 (in dealing with assessment) and in the proposed sample assessmentmaterials (available separately).\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nAs indicated in Section 1, the revisions deal only with specific problems in the previous syllabuses, and do not reflect a root-and-branch review of the mathematics education appropriate for students in the junior cycle. The main changes in content, addressing the problems identified in Section 1, are described below. A summary ofall the changes is provided in Appendix 1.\n\nCalculators and calculator-related techniques\n\nAs pointed out in the introduction to each syllabus, calculators are assumed to be readily available for appropriate use, both as teaching/learning tools and as computational aids; they will also be allowed in examinations.\n\nThe concept of \"appropriate\" use is crucial here. Calculators are part of the modern world, and students need to be able to use them efficiently where and when required. Equally, students need to retain and develop their feel for number, while the execution of mental calculations, for instance to make estimates, becomes even more important than it was heretofore. Estimation, which was not mentioned in the 1987 syllabus (though it was covered in part by the phrase \"the practice of approximating before evaluating\"), now appears explicitly and will be tested in examinations.\n\nThe importance of the changes in this area is reflected in two developments. First, a set of guidelines on calculators is being produced. It addresses issues such as the purchase of suitable machines as well as the rationale for their use. Secondly, in 1999 the Department of Education and Science commissioned a research project to monitor numeracy-related skills (with and without calculators) over the period of introduction of the revised syllabuses. If basic numeracy and mental arithmetic skills are found to disimprove, remedial action may have to be taken. It is worth noting that research has not so far isolated any consistent association between calculator use in an education system and performance by students from that system in international tests of achievement.\n\nMathematical tables are not mentioned in the content sections of the syllabus, except for a brief reference indicating that they are assumed to be available, likewise for appropriate use. Teachers and students can still avail of them as learning tools and for reference if they so wish. Tables will continue to be available in examinations, but questions will not specifically require students to use them.\n\nGeometry\n\nThe approach to synthetic geometry was one of the major areas which had to be confronted in revising the syllabuses. Evidence from examination scripts suggested that in many cases the presentation in the 1987 syllabus was not being followed in the classroom. In particular, in the Higher level syllabus, the sequence of proofs and intended proof methods were being adapted. Teachers were responding to students' difficulties in coping with the approach that attempted to integrate transformational concepts with those more traditionally associated with synthetic geometry, as described in Section 1.1 of these Guidelines.\n\nFor years, and all over the world, there have been difficulties in deciding how ­ indeed, whether ­ to present synthetic geometry and concepts of logical proof to students of junior cycle standing. Their historical importance, and their role as guardians of one of the defining aspects of mathematics as a discipline, have led to a wish to retain them in the Irish mathematics syllabuses; but the demands made on students who have not yet reached the Piagetian stage of formal operations are immense. \"Too much, too soon\" not only contravenes the principle of learnability (section 2.5), but leads to rote learning and hence failure to attain the objectives which the geometry sections of the syllabuses are meant to address. The constraints of a minor revision precluded the question of \"whether\" from being asked on this occasion. The question of \"how\" raises issues to do with the principles of soundness versus learnability. The resulting formulation set out in the syllabus does not claim to be a full description of a geometrical system. Rather, it is intended to provide a defensible teaching sequence that will allow students to learn geometry meaningfully and to come to realise the power of proof. Some of the issues that this raises are discussed in Appendix 2.\n\nThe revised version can be summarised as follows.\n\nThe approach omits the transformational elements, returning to a more traditional approach based on congruency.\n\nIn the interests of consistency and transfer between levels, the underlying ideas are basically the same across all three syllabuses, though naturally they are developed to very different levels in the different syllabuses.\n\nThe system has been carefully formulated to display the power of logical argument at a level which ­ hopefully ­ students can follow and appreciate. It is therefore strongly recommended that, in the classroom, material is introduced in the sequence in which it is listed in the syllabus document. For theHigher level syllabus, the concepts of logicalargument and rigorous proof are particularlyimportant. Thus, in examinations, attempted proofsthat presuppose \"later\" material in order to establish\"earlier\" results will be penalised. Moreover, proofsusing transformations will not be accepted.\n\nTo shorten the Higher level syllabus, only some of the theorems have been designated as ones for which students may be asked to supply proofs in the examinations. The other theorems should still beproved as part of the learning process;students should be able to follow the logical development, and see models of far more proofs than they are expected to reproduce at speed under examination conditions. The required saving of time is expected to occur because students do not have to put in the extra effort needed to develop fluency in writing out particular proofs.\n\nStudents taking the Ordinary and (a fortiori)Foundation level syllabuses are not required to prove theorems, but ­ in accordance with the level-specific aims (Section 2.4) ­ should experience the logical reasoning involved in ways in which they can understand it. The general thrust of the synthetic geometry section of the syllabuses for these students is not changed from the 1987 versions.\n\nIt may be noted that the formulation of the Foundation level syllabus in 1987 emphasised the learning process rather than the product or outcomes. In the current version, the teaching/learning suggestions are presented in theseGuidelines (chiefly in Section 4), not in the syllabus document. It is important to emphasise that the changed formulation in the syllabus is not meant to point to a more formal presentation than previously suggested for Foundation level students.\n\nSection 4.9 of this document contains a variety of suggestions as to how the teaching of synthetic geometry to junior cycle students might be addressed.\n\nTransformation geometry still figures in the syllabuses, but is treated separately from the formal development of synthetic geometry. The approach is intended to be intuitive, helping students to develop their visual and spatial ability. There are opportunities here to build on the work on symmetry in the primary curriculum and to develop aesthetic appreciation of mathematical patterns.\n\nOther changes to the Higher level syllabus\n\nLogarithms are removed. Their practical role as aids to calculation is outdated; the theory of logarithms is sufficiently abstract to belong more comfortably to the senior cycle.\n\nMany topics are \"pruned\" in order to shorten the syllabus.\n\nOther changes to the Ordinary level syllabus\n\nThe more conceptually difficult areas of algebra and coordinate geometry are simplified.\n\nA number of other topics are \"pruned\".\n\nOther changes to the Foundation level syllabus\n\nThere is less emphasis on fractions but rather more on decimals. (The change was introduced partly because of the availability of calculators ­ though, increasingly, calculators have buttons and routines which allow fractions to be handled in a comparatively easy way.)\n\nThe coverage of statistics and data handling is increased. These topics can easily be related to students' everyday lives, and so can help students to recognise the relevance of mathematics. They lend themselves also to active learning methods (such as those presented in Section 4) and the use of spatial as well as computational abilities. Altogether, therefore, the topics provide great scope for enhancing students' enjoyment and appreciation of mathematics. They also give opportunities for developing suitably concrete approaches to some of the more abstract material, notably algebra and functions (see Section 4.8).\n\nThe algebra section is slightly expanded. The formal algebraic content of the 1987 syllabus was so slight that students may not have had scope to develop their understanding; alternatively, teachers may have chosen to omit the topic. The rationale for the present adjustment might be described as \"use it or lose it\". The hope is that the students will be able to use it, and that ­ suitably addressed ­ it can help them in making some small steps towards the more abstract mathematics which they may need to encounter later in the course of their education.\n\nOverall, therefore, it is hoped that the balance between the syllabuses is improved. In particular, the Ordinary level syllabus may be better positioned between a more accessible Higher level and a slightly expanded Foundation level.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nThe brief for revision of the syllabuses, as described in Section 1.2, precluded a root-and-branch reconsideration of their style and content. However, it did allow for some changes in emphasis: or rather, in certain cases, for some of the intended emphases to be made more explicit and more clearly related to rationale, content, assessment, and ­ via the Guidelines ­ methodology. The changes in, or clarification of, emphasis refer in particular to the following areas.\n\nUnderstanding\n\nGeneral objectives B and C of the syllabus refer respectively to instrumental understanding (knowing \"what\" to do or \"how\" to do it, and hence being able to execute procedures) and relational understanding (knowing \"why\", understanding the concepts of mathematics and the way in which they connect with each other to form so-called \"conceptual structures\"). When people talk of teaching mathematics for ­ or learning it with ­ understanding, they usually mean relational understanding. The language used in the Irish syllabuses to categorise understanding is that of Skemp; the objectives could equally well have been formulated in terms of \"procedures\" and \"concepts\".\n\nResearch points to the importance of both kinds of understanding, together with knowledge of facts (general objective A), as components of mathematical proficiency, with relational understanding being crucial for retaining and applying knowledge. The Third International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, indicated that Irish teachers regard knowledge of facts and procedures as particularly important ­ unusually so in international terms; but it would appear that less heed is paid to conceptual/relational understanding. This is therefore given special emphasis in the revised syllabuses. Such understanding can be fostered by active learning, as described and illustrated in Section 4. Ways in which relational understanding can be assessed are considered in Section 5.\n\nCommunication\n\nGeneral objective H of the syllabus indicates that students should be able to communicate mathematics, both verbally and in written form, by describing and explaining the mathematical procedures they undertake and by explaining their findings and justifying their conclusions. This highlights the importance of students expressing mathematics in their own words. It is one way of promoting understanding; it may also help students to take ownership of the findings they defend, and so to be more interested in their mathematics and more motivated to learn.\n\nThe importance of discussion as a tool for ongoing assessment of students' understanding is highlighted in Section 5.2. In the context of examinations, the ability to show different stages in a procedure, explain results, give reasons for conclusions, and so forth, can be tested; some examples are given in Section 5.6.\n\nAppreciation and enjoyment\n\nGeneral objective I of the syllabus refers to appreciating mathematics. As pointed out earlier, appreciation may develop for a number of reasons, from being able to do the work successfully to responding to the abstract beauty of the subject. It is more likely to develop, however, when the mathematics lessons themselves are pleasant occasions.\n\nIn drawing up the revised syllabus and preparing the Guidelines, care has been taken to include opportunities for making the teaching and learning of mathematics more enjoyable. Enjoyment is good in its own right; also, it can develop students' motivation and hence enhance learning. For many students in the junior cycle, enjoyment (as well as understanding) can be promoted by the active learning referred to above and by placing the work in appropriate meaningful contexts. Section 4 contains many examples of enjoyable classroom activities which promote both learning and appreciation of mathematics. Teachers are likely to have their own battery of such activities which work for them and their classes. It is hoped that these can be shared amongst their colleagues and perhaps submitted for inclusion in the final version of the Guidelines.\n\nOf course, different people enjoy different kinds of mathematical activity. Appreciation and enjoyment do not come solely from \"games\"; more traditional classrooms also can be lively places in which teachers and students collaborate in the teaching and learning of mathematics and develop their appreciation of the subject. Teachers will choose approaches with whichthey themselves feel comfortable and which meet thelearning needs of the students whom they teach.\n\nThe changed or clarified emphasis in the syllabuses will be supported, where possible, by corresponding adjustments to the formulation and marking of Junior Certificate examination questions. While the wording ofquestions may be the same, the expected solutions may bedifferent. Examples are given in Section 5.\n\n3.4 CHANGES IN THE PRIMARY CURRICULUM\n\nThe changes in content and emphasis within the revised Junior Certificate mathematics syllabuses are intended, inter alia, to follow on from and build on the changes in the primary curriculum. The forthcoming alterations (scheduled to be introduced in 2002, but perhaps starting earlier in some classrooms, as teachers may anticipate the formal introduction of the changes) will affect the knowledge and attitudes that students bring to their second level education. Second level teachers need to be prepared for this. A summary of the chief alterations is given below; teachers are referred to the revised Primary School Curriculum for further details.\n\nCHANGES IN EMPHASIS\n\nIn the revised curriculum, the main changes of emphasis are as follows.\n\nThere is more emphasis on\n\nsetting the work in real-life contexts\n\nlearning through hands-on activities (using concrete materials/manipulatives, and so forth)\n\nunderstanding (in particular, gaining appropriaterelational understanding as well as instrumentalunderstanding)\n\nappropriate use of mathematical language\n\nrecording\n\nproblem-solving.\n\nThere is less emphasis on\n\nlearning routine procedures with no context provided\n\ndoing complicated calculations.\n\nCHANGES IN CONTENT\n\nThe changes in emphasis are reflected in changes to the content, the main ones being as follows.\n\nNew areas include\n\nintroduction of the calculator from Fourth Class (augmenting, not replacing, paper-and-pencil techniques)\n\n(hence) extended treatment of estimation;\n\nincreased coverage of data handling\n\nintroduction of basic probability (\"chance\").\n\nNew terminology includes\n\nthe use of the \"positive\" and \"negative\" signs for denoting a number (as in +3 [positive three], -6 [negative six] as well as the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" signs for denoting an operation (as in 7 + 3, 24 ­ 9)\n\nexplicit use of the multiplication sign in formulae (as in 2 ×r , l ×w).\n\nThe treatment of subtraction emphasises the \"renaming\" or \"decomposition\" method (as opposed to the \"equal additions\" method ­ the one which uses the terminology \"paying back\") even more strongly than does the 1971 curriculum. Use of the word \"borrowing\" is discouraged.\n\nThe following topics are among those excluded from the revised curriculum:\n\nunrestricted calculations (thus, division is restricted to at most four-digit numbers being divided by at most two-digit numbers, and ­ for fractions ­ to division of whole numbers by unit fractions)\n\n(Some of these topics were not formally included in the 1971 curriculum, but appeared in textbooks and were taught in many classrooms.)\n\nNOTE\n\nThe reductions in content have removed some areas of overlap between the 1971 Primary School Curriculum and the Junior Certificate syllabuses. Some overlap remains, however. This is natural; students entering second level schooling need to revise the concepts and techniques that they have learnt at primary level, and also need to situate these in the context of their work in the junior cycle.\n\n3.5 LINKING CONTENT AREAS WITH AIMS\n\nFinally, in this section, the content of the syllabuses is related to the aims and objectives. In fact most aims and objectives can be addressed in most areas of the syllabuses. However, some topics are more suited to the attainment of certain goals or the development of certain skills than are others. The discussion below highlights some of the main possibilities, and points to the goals that might appropriately be emphasised when various topics are taught and learnt. Phrases italicised are quoted or paraphrased from the aims as set out in the syllabus document. Section 5 of these Guidelines indicates a variety of ways in which achievement of the relevant objectives might be encouraged, tested or demonstrated.\n\nSETS\n\nSets provide a conceptual foundation for mathematics and a language by means of which mathematical ideas can be discussed. While this is perhaps the main reason for which set theory was introduced into school mathematics, its importance at junior cycle level can be described rather differently.\n\nSet problems, obviously, call for skills of problem-solving; in particular, they provide occasions for logical argument. By using data gathered from the class, they even offer opportunities for simple introduction to mathematical modelling in contexts to which the students can relate.\n\nMoreover, set theory emphasises aspects of mathematics that are not purely computational. Sets are about classification, hence about tidiness and organisation. This can lead toappreciation of mathematics on aesthetic grounds and can help to provide a basis forfurther education in the subject.\n\nAn additional point is that this topic is not part of the Primary School Curriculum, and so represents a new start, untainted by previous failure. For some students, therefore, there are particularly important opportunities for personal development.\n\nNUMBER SYSTEMS\n\nWhile mathematics is not entirely quantitative, numeracy is one of its most important aspects. Students have been building up their concepts of numbers from a very early stage in their lives. However, moving from familiarity with natural numbers (and simple operations on them) to genuine understanding of the various forms in which numbers are presented and of the uses to which they are put in the world is a considerable challenge.\n\nWeakness in this area destroys students' confidence andcompetence by depriving them of theknowledge, skillsand understanding needed for continuing theireducation and for life and work. It therefore handicaps their personal fulfilment and hencepersonaldevelopment.\n\nThe aspect of \"understanding\" is particularly important ­ or, perhaps, has had its importance highlighted ­ with advances in technology.\n\nStudents need to become familiar with the intelligent and appropriate use of calculators, while avoiding dependence on the calculators for simple calculations.\n\nComplementing this, they need to develop skills in estimation and approximation, so that numbers can be used meaningfully.\n\nAPPLIED ARITHMETIC AND MEASURE\n\nThis topic is perhaps one of the easiest to justify in terms of providing mathematics needed for life, workand leisure.\n\nStudents are likely to use the skills developed here in \"everyday\" applications, for example in looking after their personal finances and in structuring the immediate environment in which they will live. For many, therefore, this may be a key section in enabling studentsto develop a positive attitude towards mathematics as avaluable subject of study.\n\nThere are many opportunities for problem-solving, hopefully in contexts that the students recognise as relevant.\n\nThe availability of calculators may remove some of the drudgery that can be associated with realistic problems, helping the students to focus on the concepts and applications that bring the topics to life.\n\nALGEBRA\n\nAlgebra was developed because it was needed ­ because arguments in natural language were too clumsy or imprecise. It has become one of the most fundamental tools for mathematics.\n\nAs with number, therefore, confidence andcompetence are very important. Lack of these underminethepersonal development of the students by depriving them of the knowledge, skills and understanding needed forcontinuing their education and for life and work.\n\nWithout skills in algebra, students lack the technical preparation for study of other subjects in school, and in particular their foundation for appropriate studies lateron ­ including further education in mathematics itself.\n\nIt is thus particularly important that students develop appropriate understanding of the basics of algebra so that algebraic techniques are carried out meaningfully and not just as an exercise in symbol-pushing.\n\nEspecially for weaker students, this can be very challenging because algebra involves abstractions andgeneralisations.\n\nHowever, these characteristics are among the strengths and beauties of the topic. Appropriately used, algebra can enhance the students' powers of communication, facilitate simplemodelling and problem-solving, and hence illustrate the power of mathematics as a valuablesubject of study.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nOne of the ways in which the world is interpreted for us mathematically is by the use of statistics. Their prevalence, in particular on television and in the newspapers, makes them part of the environment in which children grow up, and provides students with opportunities for recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nMany of the examples refer to the students' typical areas of interest; examples include sporting averages and trends in purchases of (say) CDs.\n\nStudents can provide data for further examples from their own backgrounds and experiences.\n\nPresenting these data graphically can extend students'powers of communication and their ability to shareideas with other people, and may also provide anaesthetic element.\n\nThe fact that statistics can help to develop a positiveattitude towards mathematics as an interesting andvaluable subject of study ­ even for weaker students who find it hard to appreciate the more abstract aspects of the subject ­ explains the extra prominence given to aspects of data handling in the Foundation level syllabus, as mentioned earlier. They may be particularly important in promotingconfidence and competence in both numerical and spatial domains.\n\nGEOMETRY\n\nThe study of geometry builds on the primary school study of shape and space, and hence relates to mathematics in the world around us. In the junior cycle, different approaches to geometry address different educational goals.\n\nMore able students address one of the greatest of mathematical concepts, that of proof, and hopefully come to appreciate theabstractions andgeneralisations involved.\n\nOther students may not consider formal proof, but should be able to draw appropriate conclusions from given geometrical data.\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nExplaining and defending their findings, in either case, should help students to further their powersof communication.\n\nTackling \"cuts\" and other exercises based on the geometrical system presented in the syllabus allows students to develop their problem-solving skills.\n\nMoreover, in studying synthetic geometry, students are encountering one of the great monuments to intellectual endeavour: a very special part of Western culture.\n\nTransformation geometry builds on the study of symmetry at primary level. As the approach to transformation geometry in the revised Junior Certificate syllabus is intuitive, it is included in particular for its aesthetic value.\n\nWith the possibility of using transformations in artistic designs, it allows students to encounter creative aspectsof mathematics and to develop or exercise their own creative skills.\n\nIt can also develop their spatial ability, hopefully promotingconfidence and competence in this area.\n\nInstances of various types of symmetry in the natural and constructed environment give scope for students' recognition and enjoyment of mathematics in the worldaround them.\n\nCoordinate geometry links geometrical and algebraic ideas. On the one hand, algebraic techniques can be used to establish geometric results; on the other, algebraic entities are given pictorial representations.\n\nIts connections with functions and trigonometry, as well as algebra and geometry, make it a powerful tool for the integration of mathematics into a unified structure.\n\nIt illustrates the power of mathematics, and so helps to establish it with students as a valuable subject of study.\n\nIt provides an important foundation for appropriatestudies later on.\n\nThe graphical aspect can add a visually aestheticdimension to algebra.\n\nTRIGONOMETRY\n\nTrigonometry is a subject that has its roots in antiquity but is still of great practical use to-day. While its basic concepts are abstract, they can be addressed through practical activities.\n\nSituations to which it can be applied ­ for example, house construction, navigation, and various ball games ­ include many that are relevant to the students' life, work and leisure.\n\nIt can therefore promote the students' recognition andenjoyment of mathematics in the world around them.\n\nWith the availability of calculators, students may more easily develop competence and confidence through their work in this area.\n\nFUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS\n\nThe concept of a function is crucial in mathematics, and students need a good grasp of it in order to prepare a firm foundation for appropriate studies lateron and in particular, a basis for further education inmathematics itself.\n\nThe representation of functions by graphs adds a pictorial element that students may find aesthetic as well as enhancing their understanding and their abilityto handle generalisations.\n\nThis topic pulls together much of the groundwork done elsewhere, using the tools introduced and skills developed in earlier sections and providing opportunities forproblem-solving and simple modelling.\n\nFor Foundation students alone, simple work on the set-theoretic treatment of relations has been retained. In contexts that can be addressed by those whose numerical skills are poor, it provides exercises in simple logical thinking.\n\nNOTE\n\nThe foregoing argument presents just one vision of the rationale for including the various topics in the syllabus and for the ways in which the aims of the mathematics syllabus can be achieved. All teachers will have their own ideas about what can inspire and inform different topic areas. Their own personal visions of mathematics, and their particular areas of interest and expertise, may lead them to implement the aims very differently from the way that is suggested here. Visions can profitably be debated at teachers' meetings, with new insights being given and received as a result.\n\nThe tentative answers given here with regard to whycertain topics are included in the syllabus are, of course, offered to teachers rather than junior cycle students. In some cases, students also may find the arguments relevant. In other cases, however, the formulation is too abstract or the benefit too distant to be of interest. This, naturally, can cause problems. Clearly it would not be appropriate to reduce the syllabus to material that has immediately obvious applications in the students' everyday lives. This would leave them unprepared for further study, and would deprive them of sharing parts of our culture; in any case, not all students are motivated by supposedly everyday topics.\n\nTeachers are therefore faced with a challenging task in helping students find interest and meaning in all parts of the work. Many suggestions with proven track records in Irish schools are offered in Section 4. As indicated earlier, it is hoped that teachers will offer more ideas for an updated version of the Guidelines.","id":"/51","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9624422192573547,"__label__0":0.03757781162858009}}

{"text":"Computer algebra system\n\nA computer algebra system (CAS) is a software program that facilitates symbolic mathematics. The core functionality of a CAS is manipulation of mathematical expressions in symbolic form.\n\nThe expressions typically include polynomials in multiple variables; standard functions of expressions (sin, exponential, etc.); arbitrary functions of expressions; integrals, sums, and products of expressions; truncated series with expressions as coefficients, matrices of expressions, and so on. (This is a recursive definition.)\n\nThe symbolic manipulations supported typically include\n\nsimplification\n\nsubstitution of symbolic or numeric values for expressions\n\nchange of form of expressions: expanding products and powers, rewriting as partial fractions, etc.\n\nMany also include a high level programming language, allowing users to implement their own algorithms.\n\nThe study of algorithms useful for computer algebra systems is known as computer algebra.\n\nThe run-time of numerical programs implemented in computer algebra systems is normally longer than that of equivalent programs implemented in systems such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, or directly in C, since they are programmed for full symbolic generality and thus cannot use machine numerical operations directly.\n\nHistory\n\nComputer algebra systems began to appear in the early 1970s, and evolved out of research into artificial intelligence, though the fields are now regarded as largely separate. The first popular systems were Reduce, Derive, and Macsyma which are still commercially available; a copyleft version of Macsyma called Maxima is actively being maintained. The current market leaders are Maple and Mathematica; both are commonly used by research mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

As concentration camps do not provide books, paper, pen or pencils nearly all of his calculations had to be performed mentally. This forced Trachtenberg to develop methods and shortcuts for performing calculations mentally. Trachtenberg developed his discoveries into a complete system of mathematics.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Trachtenberg started teaching his system of mathematics. He started teaching the more backward children to prove that anyone could learn his system. In 1950 he founded the Mathematical Institute in Zurich, where both children and adults were taught the system.\n\nThe system has been thoroughly tested in Switzerland and is found to produce an increase in self confidence and general aptitude to study, as the students prove to themselves what they are capable of, by their accomplishments in calculating results to computations.\n\nThe Trachtenberg system is based on a series of keys which must be memorized. There is no need for multiplication tables or division as the system only relies on the ability to count. The system also places an emphasis on getting the right answer and provides a number of methods for checking the answers achieved by the system.\n\nResearch on the system, indicates that the system shortens time for mathematical computations by twenty percent and produces correct results, ninety nine percent of the time, due to the checking method used as part of the system.","id":"/55","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.920283854007721,"__label__0":0.07973620295524597}}

Construction requires three major types of information: (a) a clear understanding of the interaction within the individual host between the infectious agent and the host, (b) the mode and rate of transmission between individuals, and (c) host population characteristics such as demography and behaviour. Mathematical models can aid exploration of the behaviour of the system under various conditions from which to determine the dominant factors generating observed patterns and phenomena. They also aid data collection and interpretation and parameter estimation, and provide tools for identifying possible approaches to control and for assessing the potential impact of different intervention measures.\n\nRelated Topics: [ model] A set of mathematical equations which attempts to predict the behavior of a physical system(s). For example, the Rational Formula, Q = Cia, is a mathematical model for peak runoff rate prediction with a single dependent variable, Q, and three independent parameter s: C, i and A.

Bootstrap has been integrated into math and technology classrooms across the country, reaching thousands of students since 2006.\n\nProgramming.

But most\nimportantly, it teaches solid program design skills, such as\nstating input and types, writing test cases, and explaining code to others.\nBootstrap builds these elements into the curriculum in a gentle way\nthat helps students move from a word problem to finished code.\n\nAfter Bootstrap, these skills can be put to use in other programming environments, letting students take what they've learned into other programming classes.\n\nWatch the video to hear students, engineers, teachers, and the Bootstrap team describe what excites them about Bootstrap!\n\nReal, Standards-Based Math\n\nUnlike most programming classes, Bootstrap uses algebra as the vehicle for creating images and animations. That means that concepts students encounter in Bootstrap behave the exact same way that they do in math class. This lets students experiment with algebraic concepts by writing functions that make a rocket fly (linear equations), respond to keypresses (piecewise functions) or make it explode when it hits a meteor (distance formula). In fact, many word problems from standard math textbooks can be used as as programming assignments!\n\nThe entire curriculum is designed from the ground up to be aligned with Common Core standards for algebra. Bootstrap lessons cover mathematical topics that range from simple arithmetic expressions to the Pythagorean Theorem, Discrete Logic, Function Composition and the Distance Formula. The program is based on cognitive science research and best practices for improving critical thinking and problem solving.\n\n\"\"\n\n—\n\nOur team\n\nBootstrap is the creation of Emmanuel Schanzer, M.Ed.

{"text":"What to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nWhat to learn in pure math for applied math?\n\nSo I finished my undergrad last year in applied math and physics. I'm currently applying to applied math phD programs (but they are separate depts from the pure math depts). I don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory. Perhaps the program I go to will let me work with a pure math prof doing stuff in string theory\n\nThe applied math courses I've taken include proof-based fourier analysis, linear algebra, and analysis. Also, courses in prob/stats, complex analysis, ODEs, PDEs, dynamical systems, and numerical analysis. So what should I self-study in the meantime? I was thinking topology or the second half of real analysis (integration, metric spaces. Lebesgue, etc).\n\nI've been told by three advisor-type people in my department that analysis is absolutely necessary for any math program (and as such, all math majors are required to take one semester). Since most of the math grad programs I've looked at start with a year of analysis study, I'd recommend doing as much of that as possible. Topology is probably a good idea too.\n\nIt really depends on the area of applied mathematics that you want to work on and taking certain courses will be completely useless in other areas, for example if you want to study string theory then a course such as algebraic topology or non commutative geometry seems good but that has almost no applicability in most other areas. However, there are courses that let you keep your options open. I would recommend any of the following courses, if you have not decided on your specialty yet.\n\ndefinitely study complex analysis if you have not taken a course in it already.\na second course in partial differential equations\na course in applied nonlinear equations\nAs many courses as you can in numerical analysis( a good choice is computational methods for PDE's or high-performance scientific computation)\na course in linear programming\na course in combinatorics\nmaybe a course in control theory\n\nIf you are more into mathematical physics then you can take the following courses that don't require serious knowledge of physics.\n\nDifferential Geometry\nmathematics of Fluid Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Mechanics\nmathematics of Quantum Field Theory\nmathematics of General Relativity\n\nIf you are interested in theoretical computer science(which is a branch of applied math) you can study,\n\nAs many courses in real analysis as possible\nAs many courses in statistics, probability.\na second course in numerical analysis.\na course in nonlinear optimization\na course in mathematical theory of finance.\n\nBTW, take topology only if you are going into mathematical physics, or you want to do serious\ncoursework in real analysis, other than that topology has little applicability in other areas.\n\nI don't exactly what I want to focus on, but I was thinking something in mathematical physics, PDEs, functional analysis, and operator theory.\n\nIf I wanted to do the math of QFT and relativity, I sure hope those don't require much knowledge of physics. I hate studying relativity\n\nFirst of all, I don't think you should go for mathematical physics if you hate studying relativity. After all, all those courses do involve physics.\nBut I am pretty sure that the courses I listed under mathematical physics don't require any serious knowledge of physics, I myself took General Relativity and did well. The only physics courses I had taken were general physics I and II. The only course requirement for that was introductory differential geometry. Mathematics of QM and QFT require some knowledge of PDE's operator theory and functional analysis and basic probability and again no physics beyond freshman year. Topology is also very helpful in QFT and latter on if you want to study a specialized course in string theory. So I think overall topology is a good idea if you wanna go for mathematical physics.","id":"/60","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9620507955551147,"__label__0":0.03796922042965889}}

{"text":"MA Mathematics Domains of Study\n\nAreas of Study Within the\nM.A. in Mathematics Education Degree\n\nThe WGU Master of Arts in Mathematics Education (K-6, 5-9 or 5-12) program content is based on research on effective instruction as well as national and state standards. It provides the knowledge and skills that enable teachers to teach effectively in diverse classrooms. The M.A. in Mathematics Education program content and training processes are consistent with the accountability intent of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The degree program is focused on the preparation of highly qualified teachers. As described in the federal legislation, a highly qualified teacher is one who not only possesses full state certification, but also has solid content knowledge of the subject(s) he or she teaches.\n\nThe following section includes the larger domains of knowledge, which are then followed by the subject-specific subdomains of knowledge.\n\nElementary Mathematics Education Domain (for the K-6 program)\n\nThis domain focuses on the following mathematics content, as well as central issues related to the teaching of these topics in grades K–6:\n\nMathematics (K-6) Content\nThis subdomain focuses on the following mathematics content with integrated mathematics pedagogy: Introduction to Number Sense; Patterns and Functions; Integers and Order of Operations; Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages; Coordinate Pairs and Graphing; Ratios and Proportional Reasoning; Equations and Inequalities; Geometry and Measurement; and Statistics, Data Analysis, and Probability.\n\nFinite Mathematics\nThis subdomain focuses on the real number system, symbolic logic, number theory, set theory, graph theory and their applications.\n\nMiddle School Mathematics Content Domain (for the 5-9 program)\n\nThis domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: Finite Mathematics, College Algebra, Pre-calculus, Probability and Statistics I, College Geometry and Calculus I.\n\nFinite Mathematics\nThis sub-domain focuses on the real number system, symbolic logic, number theory, set theory, graph theory and their applications.\n\nCollege Algebra\nThis sub-domain focuses on equations, inequalities, polynomials, conic sections, and functional analysis including logarithmic, exponential, and inverse functions in problem solvingComprehensive Exam\nThe CYV1 is a comprehensive exam assessing the student's knowledge of the subdomains listed above.\n\nHigh School Mathematics Content Domain (for the 5-12 program)\n\nThis domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: This domain focuses on the following areas of mathematics: Pre-Calculus, Probability and Statistics, College Geometry, Calculus and Analysis, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra, and Mathematical Modeling and ConnectionsCalculus II\nThis sub-domain focuses on integration techniques and applications, the solution of differential equations, and the analysis of sequences.\n\nResearch Fundamentals Domain (for the K-6 and 5-9 programs)Capstone Project (for the K-6 program)\n\nThe Capstone Project is the culmination of the student's WGU degree program. It requires the demonstration of competencies through a deliverable of significant scope that includes both a written capstone project and an oral defense.\n\nStudents will be able to choose from two areas of emphasis, depending on personal and professional interests. These two areas include instructional design and research. If carefully planned in advance, the individual domain projects may serve as components of the capstone. For capstones with the instructional design emphasis, students will design, manage, and develop an instructional product for which there is an identified need. The product can be delivered via the medium of choice (e.g., print-based, computer-based, video-based, web-based, or a combination of these), but you must provide a rationale for the medium selected. The instructional product you develop for your capstone should be an exportable form of instruction designed to bring your target audience to a mastery of predetermined knowledge and skills.\n\nFor capstones with the research emphasis, students will design and conduct a data-based investigation of a conclusion-oriented question (decision-oriented investigations are most generally considered to be evaluation projects). The project report should be of publishable quality and may be submitted to an appropriate professional journal at the completion of the project. At the minimum you should plan to share your results with your school or organization questions covering the mathematics content domain. The purpose of the exam is a checkpoint to ensure that you have acquired the critically required skills and knowledge specified in the program competencies.\n\nTeacher Work Sample Written Project (for the 5-9 and 5-12 programs)\n\nThe Teacher Work Sample Written Project is the culmination of the student's WGU degree program. It requires the demonstration of competencies through a deliverable of significant scope that includes both a written project and an oral defense.\n\nThe Teacher Work Sample is a written project containing a comprehensive, original, research based curriculum unit designed to meet an identified educational need. It provides direct evidence of the candidate's ability to design and implement a multi-week, standards-based unit of instruction, assess student learning, and then reflect on the learning process. The WGU Teacher Work Sample requires students to plan and teach a multi-week standards-based instructional unit consisting of seven components: 1) Contextual factors, 2) learning goals, 3) assessment, 4) design for instruction, 5) instructional decision making, 6) analysis of student learning, and 7) self-evaluation and reflection a presentation (typically PowerPoint) and defense of the Teacher Work Sample (TWS). Candidates will be asked to reflect upon the TWS, note its strengths and weaknesses, discuss its impact on student learning, and suggest future improvements. The purpose of the exam is a checkpoint to ensure that you have acquired the critically required skills and knowledge specified in the program competencies.\n\nNBC News Reports on WGU\n\n\"The dreams of 19 governors have become [WGU Grad Angie Gonzalez's] dream fulfilled.\"","id":"/65","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9465820789337158,"__label__0":0.053437892347574234}}

I have used Saxon 1, 2, 3 and 5/4 now. Thus far, we have been very pleased with the curriculum. It allows me, the teacher to move a quickly or as slowly as the student needs. I am able to use the tests and assessments included in the student workbook to determine where to place the child and to even skip ahead if needed so that valuable time is not spent on things already mastered. The Teachers Manual is able to be reused with other students, but we always purchase a new workbook for each new student. The price of the workbooks are very reasonable.\n\nWe used four other math curricula in the course of 15 years of homeschooling. I looked at Saxon Math when our oldest was in the 5th grade and didn't think I could do it. I was wrong. After years of struggling with other math programs I made the switch for our two smallest in 1st grade. We have used the Saxon Math for three years now and it has made a big difference in how we look at Math. I would highly recommend this curriculum. There is no DVD from Saxon for k-3, but starting in 4/5 you can purchase one. There is a company called Destination Math that has an online program that runs right with the Saxon Math. Just for the record, Math was not my best subject when I was in school. So those first years of teaching were a struggle for me to try to teach something I had a hard time understanding. Saxon Math has helped me while I have been teaching. It's very easy to follow and one of the few subjects that I actually follow very closely by the teacher's book.\n\nWe just switched to Saxon month a few months ago. I have a daughter who really doesn't like math. I took her to Mardel's and let her choose a math program (I got final approval rights. ;) ) She surprised me and picked Saxon. It is extremely black and white and not like the colorful books we have used before. She loves it so far and seems to be grasping the concepts. We didn't buy the manipulatives as I had a lot of them at home already (from other math programs we've used.) I can't really give this an excellent review as we are still new into it.\n\nThis curriculum was perfect for my sons needs at the moment. He did go through the years worth of work very quickly, but he has a real thirst for math. My son wanted a few math games added to suppliment his text work. It is a good curriculum.","id":"/67","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9347879886627197,"__label__0":0.06523202359676361}}

{"text":"Introduction To Precalculus\n\nposted on: 20 Jun, 2012 | updated on: 21 Jun, 2012\n\nIn mathematical world, we study different topic, here we will see the pre Calculus introduction. Pre calculus is a topic which comes from the study of motion. It deals with different ideas, areas and volumes, rates of change, the orbits of planets, and infinite sequences.\nPre calculus consists of those subjects, skills, and insights which are necessary to recognize calculus. It involves arithmetic, algebra, coordinate Geometry, trigonometry, and, functions. In Pre calculus we study many different type of topics which includes, sets, real numbers, complex numbers, composite and polynomial Functions, trigonometry, limits, vectors, metrics, binomial theorem, and many other topics. Let's understand few basic topic of pre calculus.\nSet: - We know that Set is a collection of different type of objects which are defined in proper manner. Different types of operation are present in the set that are Union, intersection, complements and Cardinality product. Sets are of different type like Empty set, Universal set, etc.\nIf no element is available in the set then it is known as empty set, and the Sets are present in the universe of conversation are universal set.\nEmpty set is denoted by the symbol '∅' and universal set is denoted by 'U'\nReal number: - In the Real Numbers all the Rational and Irrational Numbers and whole numbers are present.\nFor example: Whole numbers are (1, 4, 6, 8, 10). Sometime the number 0 is also involved in Whole Number.\nRational number – The Rational Numbers are 3/5, 0.16, 0.33…2.2 etc.\nIrrational number – Irrational numbers are (⊼, √ 3) etc.\nIf we have √ -3, this number is not considered in the category of real number because it contains imaginary value and '∞' and it is not a real number.\nThis is a brief introduction to Precalculus in which we come across few Basic Terms of pre calculus.","id":"/81","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9877902269363403,"__label__0":0.012229719199240208}}

Beginning with an overview of the principles of inheritance such as cell division and Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse methods that scientists employ to study heredity.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. SuzukiFALL 2010 V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How It Works Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0313 Natural Science II: The Brain: A User's Guide Prof. Azmitia (Biology) syllabus The Human Brain is the most complex organ. Despite the central position it has in nearly every aspect of our daily lives, it remains to many a mystery. How does it work? How can we care for it? How long will it function? This MAP course is designed to provide answers to these questions, and many more at an academic level accessible to the non-scientist student, and of interest to the scientist with little exposure to neuroscience. The aims of the course are to provide the student with a firm foundation in what the brain looks like and what each of the parts do. To accomplish this, we will learn about the functions of the cortex in higher learning and memory, as well as discuss the basic work of the brainstem in regulating the internal environment of the body. The importance of nutrition on neurotransmitter synthesis, the function of sleep on memory and why we need so much of it, and the effects of alcohol and drugs on brain harmony and the meaning of addiction will be some of the points covered in this course. We will look at brain development and the special needs of children, as well as brain aging and illness and the difficulty of helping. The laboratories are designed to provide hands-on experience in exploring the structure of the brain as well as learning how to measure brain functioning. We will provide specially prepared slides so the student can recognize a neuron and differentiate a dendrite from an axon. The molecular shape of neurotransmitter will be covered, as well as learning how to measure alcohol and determining its levels in your body. It is expected that by the end of the course, the student will be familiar with the biological basis of brain structure and function, and not only be able to detect how a normal brain works, but also how to help keep it healthy.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins Prof. Bailey (Anthropology) syllabus An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species. This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric humans, the Neandertal enigma, the importance of studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the 6-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior Prof. HawkenSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works. This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0314 Natural Science II: Genomes and Diversity Prof. Siegal (Biology) syllabus Millions of species of animals, plants and microbes inhabit our planet. Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms, from their ancient history to their physiological and ecological habits. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity, focusing on domesticated species, such as dogs and tomatoes, as examples of how genomic methods can be used to identify genes that underlie new or otherwise interesting traits. Genomics has also transformed the study of human diversity and human disease. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. With the powerful new technologies to study genomes has come an increased power to manipulate them. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.\n\nTexts and Ideas\n\nNote: Previously listed as Conversations of the West\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature) syllabus \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness…\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics - Spectatorship—Ethics, Politics, Aesthetics Prof. Harries (English) syllabus Are you responsible for what you see? Sometimes? Never? Always? How do you decide? Why do works of art so often represent suffering? Does art allow us to witness suffering without having to take responsibility for that suffering? What happens when we witness real suffering as though it were art? We consider crucial texts on spectatorship from Plato to the present, how various thinkers and artists have approached these and other questions, and how looking from a distance has informed thinking about aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Throughout our discussions of these readings, we ask what it means that thinkers insist that looking has power: power to produce various emotions from desire to sympathy, or power to produce social and even political bonds. These thinkers will, in turn, challenge us to think about the function of images in the present. Readings and films: Plato's Republic, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare's King Lear, Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments, Rousseau's Letter to M. d'Alembert on the Theatre, Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy, selections from Freud, Beckett's Endgame, Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr., Hitchcock's Rear Window.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics-- The Deliberating Citizen Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus What do we need to function as citizens of a democracy--capacities of reason, imagination, or eloquence? Skills in analyzing public discourse or habits of historical memory? Is belief in God required, or particular emotional tendencies or sympathies? What kind of humanistic values, if any, can and should a democracy promote? We examine these questions on the assumption that intensive close reading (and listening, in Mozart's case) promotes the habits of engaged, articulate talking and writing that are the bedrock of civic education. Music of Mozart and readings from Plato, Thucydides, Vergil, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Kant, Adam Smith, John Dewey, Hannah Arendt.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0402 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Bolduc (French) syllabus Explores how books give shape, meaning, and purpose to the world and human experience. As it reinterprets the Greek and Roman legacy, the Renaissance faces crucial epistemological shifts triggered by new discoveries that call to mind our own struggles: making sense of a world in constant flux where truths are not only put into question but also lead to bloodshed. Grouped under four main themes--epic and the human experience, tales of beginnings and ends, battles for truth, writings of the self--we consider the purpose of this conversation between writers of different epochs and its relevance for understanding our own culture. Reading: Vergil's Aeneid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, Hesiod's Theogony, selections from Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Machiavelli's Prince, Navarre's Heptameron, Sophocles' Antigone, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Plato's Symposium, Augustine's Confessions, selections from Montaigne's Essays.\n\nFALL 2010FALL 2010 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Garrett (Philosophy) syllabus All animals live, but only human beings consider how to live; and only reflective human beings deliberate among different ways to decide how to live. Should one look for guidance to tradition, to religion, to the state, to nature, to feeling, to reason? Versions of this question were raised and addressed repeatedly and with urgency in both Antiquity and the Enlightenment. We examine some of the most important and influential attempts to answer it and some of the dialogue that such attempts have had with one another. Readings include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Greek tragedy and philosophy, Spinoza, Locke, Rousseau, Hume, Kant, Wollstonecraft.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Calhoun (Sociology) syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, faith, ethics, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0412 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance - Writing Intensive Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor) syllabus What is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics), Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these, the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way.\n\nNote: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.\n\nNote: Offered in conjunction with selected sections of V40.0100, Writing the Essay.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative and Western Thought Prof. Weiler (Law) syllabus Issue of justice and injustice and other normative concerns. Each week pairs a core reading from the Hebrew Bible or the New Testament with another work in the Western tradition to explore a broad range of complex normative issues. Often God will be \"on trial:\" Was the Deluge genocide? Is Abraham guilty of attempted murder and child abuse? Was Jesus guilty as charged? Was Socrates? The themes are all of relevance to contemporary issues: communal responsibility vs. individual autonomy, ecological crisis, ethics vs. religion, freedom of speech and thought, genocide, rule of law and civil disobedience, the Other, punishment and retribution, religious intolerance, sanctity of human life, sex and gender. The course will be taught at the Law School in Law School style—rigourous but academically and intellectually rewarding. Primary readings include: Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology; Xenophon's Apology; Sophocles' Antigone; selections from Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Aristotle, Maimonides, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Kierkegaard, Mill, Thoreau, Kafka, Camus.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Free Will in Western Thought Prof. Krabbenhoft (Spanish and Portuguese) syllabus The freedom of the human will has been a foundational premise of Western civilization from the early centuries of the Christian era to the present, and yet it has been questioned and even rejected by some of the most influential thinkers of the modern period. We look at the sources of the modern debate in passages from the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophy, in key texts by Augustine, Luther, and Erasmus, and in the shift toward a deontological view in Kant, Schopenhauer, and nineteenth-century materialism. From this historical overview we move to contemporary theories of freedom and determinism, as well as a discussion of the intersection of neuroscience and the philosophy of free will, and read a number of literary texts in the light of theory: Sophocles' Philoctetes, Tirso de Molina's Trickster of Seville, Tolstoy's Death of Ivan Ilyich, and Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Literature in Wonderland Prof. Momma (English) syllabus How to Play with Language: We use language every day, and yet we do not seem to know exactly how it works. Communicating with others through language sometimes feels like playing a game. But does this mean we have only one language game to play, or that we follow only one set of rules all the time? Just like Alice, who was constantly frustrated by the logic of the inhabitants of Wonderland, we are often baffled by difficulties in communicating even the simplest idea. We explore issues on language that may be raised by reading literary and philosophical texts written by \"language-conscious\" authors: Is language the only way to communicate? Do we know anything about the origin of language? Do grammar and rhetoric help us communicate well or persuade others? Do etymology and the history of English tell us anything new about the language we know already? Do our minds work exactly the same way regardless of the language we speak? How do we do things with words? Readings: Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, Plato's Cratylus, Aristotle's Poetics, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Beowulf, Chaucer's House of Fame, Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Borges' Library of Babel, Achebe's Things Fall Apart.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Freedom and Oppression Prof. Kunhardt (History) syllabus Examines the human quest for freedom—freedom from slavery, from sexual oppression, and from the shackling of the mind—as these three came to a crisis in nineteenth century America. We begin with a critical reading of formative biblical texts and ideas; touch down on the passionate thought-world of the American founders; and culminate in a close look at mid-nineteenth century reform efforts, and the ideas of freedom that animated them. Exploring the dawn of biblical humanism, the embrace of the secular, and efforts to widen the circles of inclusion, we pay particular attention to the writings of Abraham Lincoln and his generation, as he and others, both allies and critics, worked to eradicate slavery from American society. Why did the Bible condone slavery, helping Americans justify continuing the practice? In what ways are competing ideas of freedom to be judged? How is the idea of freedom related to that of human equality? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Psalms, Isaiah, Matthew, Luke; and works by Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Garrison, Douglass, Sumner, Stanton, Anthony, Rose, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Parker, Mill, Ingersoll, Lincoln.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0400 Texts and Ideas: Topics: Mortal and Immortal Questions Professor Mitsis (Classics) syllabus A wide-ranging selection of works that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about the nature of religion, the successes and failures of rational argument, the justification of social and political obligations, the benefits and dangers of technology and scientific knowledge, and the value of emotions and our attachments to others. Throughout the semester, students have the opportunity to become more practiced in formulating moral, political, and aesthetic arguments and in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude, that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death--or, perhaps, worse, faced with eternal life. Readings: Homer, Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Epicureans, Stoics, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Augustine, Teresa of Avila, Hume, d'Holbach, Rousseau, Mill, Marx, Tolstoy, Freud, Proust.\n\nSPRING 2011SPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Rubenstein (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Beginning with the collision of the \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenistic traditions and their encounter in the Christian Scriptures and Augustine, we see Enlightenment thinkers grapple with the fusion of these traditions they had inherited, subjecting both to serious criticism and revising them as a new tradition—science and technology—rises to prominence. Reading from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles, Plato, Augustine, Montesquieu, Pope, Voltaire, and Rousseau.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French) syllabus The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and Rêveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\"\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0404 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology) syllabus Explores the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides' Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents.\n\nCultures and Contexts\n\nNote: Previously listed as World Cultures\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0502 Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or as historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200 years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978–79 Islamic Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority—some 60%—of the population, but historically they have been deprived of power in the government and of access to the political and economic life of the country.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0506 Cultures and Contexts: Chinese and Japanese Traditions Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus Essential aspects of Asian culture—Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China, show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0509 Cultures and Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0514 Cultures and Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0515 Cultures and Contexts: Latin America Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus Spanish, African, and Amerindian Sources of Latin American Identities. Explores the emergence of contemporary Latin America through the past and present doings of its persons and their representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature. Through in-depth treatment of selected cases, and via the perspectives of history, anthropology, and cultural criticism, focusing on texts but also film, dance, music, and performance, the aims is both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness (and of global modernity) in the historical confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national integration. At base, we seek to answer more fundamental questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of so-called globalization? Includes frank and explicit discussion of race, sex, and religion.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0534 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Prof. Morgan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus A range of intersecting questions concerning the African Diaspora and what it produces: What does the trans-Atlantic slave trade create in the early modern and modern world? How is our understanding of trade, culture, capitalism, justice, race, gender, and work shaped by the histories of dispersal that characterize the Atlantic World? What aspects of culture, politics, identity, and social formations are illuminated when we think critically about the African Diaspora and the forces that propel it?\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew & Judaic Studies) syllabus Modern Israel—Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0539 Cultures and Contexts: Asian Pacific American Cultures Prof. Tu (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Major issues in the historical and contemporary experiences of Asian Pacific Americans, including migration, modernization, racial formation, community-building, and political mobilization, among others. Asian Pacific America encompasses a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people. As an expression/reflection of their cultural identities, historical conditions, and political efforts, we pay particular attention to Asian Americans' use of cultural productions-films, literature, art, media, and popular culture.\n\nFall 2010 V55.0541 Cultures and Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Lane (Spanish & Portuguese) syllabus What was America before it was called America? How did indigenous cultures understand and document their first encounters with Europeans? We focus on peoples, events, and cultural expressions associated with the conquest and colonization of the Americas, concentrating on three key areas: central Mexico, home to a several pre-Columbian societies, most notably the Aztec Empire, and later the seat of Spanish power in northern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of New Spain); the central Andes, home of the Incas and later the site of Spanish power in southern Latin America (the Viceroyalty of Peru); and finally, early plantation societies of the Caribbean, where the violent history of enslaved Africans in the new world unfolded. On one hand, we explore how those subjugated by conquest and colonialism interpreted, resisted, and recorded their experience. On the other, we ask what new cultural forms emerged from these violent encounters, and consider their role in the foundation of \"Latin American\" cultures. Readings balance a range of primary documents and art created during the \"age of encounter,\" including maps, letters, paintings, and testimonials, along with historical and theoretical texts.\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Morris (ISAWFALL 2010 V55.0546 Cultures and Contexts: Global Asia Prof. Ludden (History) syllabus Explores the expansive transformation of Asian cultures from ancient times to the present, focusing on networks of mobility, interaction, social order, and exchange that form the particularity of Asian cultures through entanglements with others. Beginning in the days of Alexander the Great and the formation of the Afro-Eurasian ecumene, follows tracts of Buddhist, Confucian, Hindu, and Muslim expansion; then turns to the age of early modern landed empires, Ottoman-Safavid-Mughal-Ming/Ching, and their interactions with seaborne European expansion. Studies truly global formations of culture in the flow of goods, ideas, and people among world regions, during the age of modern empires and nationalism, including the rise of the nation as a cultural norm, capitalism in Asia, and Japanese expansion around the Pacific rim. Concludes by considering cultural change attending globalization since the 1950s, focusing on entanglements of Asian cultures with the globalizing culture of the market, consumerism, and wage labor, and transnational labor migration as well as Asian cultural spaces in and around New York City, including our nearby Chinatown.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Hull (History) syllabus Focuses on several major African cultures that influenced each other's development from the pre-colonial through the postcolonial eras. These multi-dimensional cultures are examined through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, and museum artifacts, with emphasis on concepts of cultural identity and interchange, modernization, and cosmopolitanism. Africa is examined not only within the context of indigenous cultures but within the context of the world at large. In this vein, we weigh the contributions African cultures made to each other but also to the wider world.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa Prof. Beidelman (Anthropology) syllabus Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues, the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0507 Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Solt (History) syllabus Postwar Japan, 1945 to Present. An inquiry into Japan's social, political, and economic transformation since World War II. Examines the role of the Cold War, the U.S. Occupation, the \"Peace\" Constitution, the symbolic monarchy, the economic \"miracle,\" corporate structure, the gendering of labor, and the legacy of war in shaping the history of postwar Japan. An underlying theme is the connection between political economy and culture. As such, we focus on the geopolitical and economic structures underpinning the visible transformations in everyday life and try to connect these transformations in Japanese history to broader themes in global history.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0510 Cultures and Contexts: Russia—between East and West Prof. Borenstein (Russian & Slavic Studies)syllabus What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West), or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very beginnings to the present day.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0512 Cultures and Contexts: China Prof. Button (East Asian Studies) syllabus However one might choose to define the nature of human being, no one is ever merely human. Apart from whatever common essence we may be said to share, we are always also a combination of racial, ethnic, national, and gender differences. Over the course of several millennia Chinese culture has produced different conceptions of human being. We explore the variety of ways those conceptions have changed over time. Central to our inquiry is the question of how contending visions of the human are expressed and contested in different kinds of philosophical and literary texts, as well as artistic works in other media, including visual culture and film. Our guiding focus is on how ideas about human being in China have shaped gender roles and relations, the discourses of spirituality and the supernatural, as well as modern problems of race, nationalism, and revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0516 Cultures and Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology) syllabus Utilizing a variety of sources—novels, films, and academic scholarship—students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0529 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Rosaldo and Prof. Gaytan (Social and Cultural Analysis) syllabus Addresses immigration, social movements, figures of resistance, testimonials, identities, popular culture, and language. Using an interdisciplinary approach that draws on readings from imaginative literature to social science, we explore Latino communities in the United States and the issues that divide and unite them.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0533 Cultures and Contexts: Iran Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern & Islamic Societies) syllabus From Ancient Persia to Contemporary Iran: For 2500 years, the culture and civilization of Iran, (known in the West prior to World War II as Persia), has survived innumerable attacks and vicissitudes, which swept away many other cultures, languages, and nations. The first empire in human history to be multiracial, multicultural, and multi-religious, based on tolerance, expanded ultimately to encompass all the lands from the Hindu Kush to North Africa. Emphasizing the growth of ancient Iranian culture--particularly art, architecture, literature, and their influence--we investigate the traditional myths and religions of ancient Iran, the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness, the establishment of Shi'i Islam as the state religion, and the conflict of the vision and mysticism of traditional Iranian culture with that of the West. We survey the political organization of the Empire, Alexander the Great's conquest of Iran and its aftermath, and the impact of the Arab-Islamic conquest. We examine the rebirth of Iranian self-consciousness after World War II, and the transformation of the country during the Islamic Revolution.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0545 Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew and Judaic StudiesSPRING 2011 V55.0549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History) syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond.\n\nExpressive Culture\n\nFALL 2010 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses0751 Expressive Culture: Television Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus The Twilight Zone and Expressive Culture of the 1950s and 1960s. According to cliché, the 1950s in America were a period of conformity and consensus, but it is clear that there were many signs of discontent with and within the image of cheerful homogeneity. For example, at the end of the decade, the television program The Twilight Zone, showed everyday life as a source of paranoia in which ordinary existence revealed its frightening underside. Then, as the nation engaged with the New Frontier of the Kennedy 1960s, the show used science fiction to represent dreams as American nightmares. We look at The Twilight Zone in terms of its expressive rendition of 1950s and 1960s America. Along the way, we examine the shift in American television from East Coast production of liberal drama to West Coast production of escapism and entertainment and will situate Rod Serling's career within that shift. We also examine other renditions of paranoia (and symbolic resolutions of it) across the popular culture and politics of the moment. Most broadly, we attempt to examine the medium of popular television as an expressive cultural form which enlightened liberals like Serling tried to use as a mode of moral and aesthetic uplift. Critical methods that might help us understand the potentials of television as expressive culture are emphasized.\n\nSPRING 2011 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. Zayaruzny investigateSpring 2011 V55.0730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. MuellerSPRING 2011 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75, considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in American society. Examines developments in film genre during this period especially in relation to political and cultural change. Narrative innovations are emphasized, with special attention to the specificity of film form and style (e.g., editing, mise-en-scène, sound). Provides an introduction to the methods and principles of film analysis as well as dealing with this period of filmmaking in depth. Includes films by Kubrick, Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese.\n\nStudy Abroad at NYU Global Sites\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9549 Cultures and Contexts: Multinational Britain\nProf. Woods (NYU in London) syllabus The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9505 Cultures and Contexts: Africa\nProf. Adams (NYU in Ghana) syllabus African culture through autobiography. Texts consist of chronological life histories and memoirs, e. g., by writers of aristocratic birth and those of peasant birth, by individuals accomplished in the arts and others in the sciences, by Nobel laureates and by political leaders, by women and by men. Each narrative provides an intimate acquaintance with the traditions, aspirations, challenges, and strategies from the writer's own society. Collectively they provide the skeleton of a usefully subjective narrative of modern African history. The depicted lives include an 18th-century enslaved Nigerian child, who, ultimately, as a free man, would become a respected abolitionist; the U.S.-educated leader of Africa's first nation to gain independence from colonialism; the passionate Kenyan crusader for the preservation of Africa's environment as the source of its self-development; and the physically and morally courageous exemplar of the battle that overthrew South African apartheid.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9544 Cultures and Contexts: Spain—At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America\nProf. Galban (NYU in Madrid) syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain—the idea of Spain—that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain's New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933–36). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9547 Cultures and Contexts: Multicultural France\nProf. Epstein (NYU in Paris) syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \"race,\" identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \"ethnic community\" so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \"homogeneity\" of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \"primitive\" art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, négritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9548 Cultures and Contexts: Prague—In the Heart of Central Europe\nProf. Mucha (NYU in Prague) syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world's richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9537 Cultures and Contexts: Modern Israel\nProf. Emmerich (NYU in Tel Aviv) syllabus Explores various aspects of the production of everydayness in Israel as it is manifested in different sites: the arts, the leisure industry, and the spatio-temporal arrangements of daily routines and practices. Given its unique geo-political circumstances and its symbolic position, Israel attracts much media coverage as well as more scholarly treatment of the Israeli-Arab or Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More often than not, Israel is portrayed through the lens of high politics or treated as an exotic anomaly. Whether popular or academic in its orientation, the study of Israeli society has thus tended to neglect everyday life in Israel. We consider aspects of Israeli politics and culture; visit art exhibitions, music venues, and the cinema; and observe street life in Tel Aviv (day and night).\n\nSpring 2011 V55.9730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds\nProf. Cusick (NYU in Florence","id":"/83","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9514293074607849,"__label__0":0.04859067127108574}}

{"text":"At Lawrence North High School, the entire hand-picked team of Algebra 1 instructors believes passionately that mastering these skills and concepts will have a stronger influence on your future success throughout high school and beyond than any other single course in which you may choose to enroll. Algebra 1 skills and conceptual relationships are the foundation of the CORE 40 graduation exam but will also prepare you for future math and science courses. We are committed as a team to providing quality instruction and appropriate materials and supporting you with plenty of attention, patience, and other resources. We understand the importance of the content of this class and we truly want you to succeed.\n\nSome of the \"big ideas\" we emphasize in Algebra 1 include properties of real numbers, solving equations and inequalities and proportions, functions and graphs, understanding lines and slope, polynomials and factoring, radicals and quadratic functions.\n\nOur measuring sticks are that darn CORE 40 test and your future success in Algebra 2, but our focus is on mastering those \"big ideas\" along the way. Some of these skills will be difficult for you to understand at first. I encourage you to keep these three P's in mind:\n\n1)Practice! Math is a skill and can only be mastered through routine,\n\nrigorous and disciplined practice.\n\n2)Pace! Don't try to rush or skip ahead until you fully understand what we have already done.\n\nTake breaks and ask lots of questions.\n\n3)Perspective! This class is imperative regardless of your goals. I encourage you to\n\ntake a step back from the mechanical steps of the arithmetic and try to understand\n\nthe concepts and relationships. When you understand why certain steps are required\n\nCongratulations! You made it to the second semester of Algebra 1. Only the students who have demonstrated a solid understanding of the concepts in the first semester are here right now. Yes, it's that important. The second semester is notable more difficult than the first, but we're confident you'll make it through or it would not have been recommended that you be here. We have two goals this semester: 1) to make sure everyone is prepared for the Algebra 1 End-of-Course Assessment (ECA) graduation exam in May, and 2) to help ensure your future success in Algebra 2.\n\nOur seventh unit explains the rules for exponents and multiplying and dividing factors with the same base. We'll follow that up with a unit on polynomials to get comfortable adding and subtracting like terms with exponents, then multiply polynomial groups together using the Distributive Property. In the next unit we will change directions and go backwards through the distributive process to factor polynomial expressions, especially quadratic trinomials. As the quarter draws to a close, we'll be breaking down and solving quadratic equations.","id":"/88","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9654327034950256,"__label__0":0.03458733111619949}}

{"text":"This book explains, as clearly as possible, tensors and such related topics as tensor products of vector spaces, tensor algebras, and exterior algebras. You will appreciate Yokonuma's lucid and methodical treatment of the subject. This book is useful in undergraduate and graduate courses in multilinear algebra.\n\nTensor Spaces and Exterior Algebra begins with basic notions associated with tensors. To facilitate understanding of the definitions, Yokonuma often presents two or more different ways of describing one object. Next, the properties and applications of tensors are developed, including the classical definition of tensors and the description of relative tensors. Also discussed are the algebraic foundations of tensor calculus and applications of exterior algebra to determinants and to geometry. This book closes with an examination of algebraic systems with bilinear multiplication. In particular, Yokonuma discusses the theory of replicas of Chevalley and several properties of Lie algebras deduced from them.\n\nReadership\n\nGraduate students as well as experts in theoretical and mathematical physics, differential and integral equations and mathematical analysis.\n\nReviews\n\n\"This book provides a well-organized introduction to tensors and related topics and could be useful for students of different levels (including Ph.D. level).

{"text":"MATH32012 Commutative Algebra - 2012/13, Semester 2\n\nOnline Test\n\nThe Online Test is currently accessible via the MATH32012 course content page in Blackboard.\nYou may retake the test for revision purposes (e.g., to practise\nthe computation of Gröbner bases). It will not affect your coursework mark.\n(The coursework marks have been finalised and are available via the Grade\nCentre in Blackboard.)\n\nModule description and prerequisites\n\nYou should have general facility for dealing with algebraic structures: complex numbers, sets, groups, rings, fields. For this reason, MATH20212 Algebraic Structures 2 is a prerequisite.\n\nAbout the course\n\nMany find MATH32012 Commutative Algebra the most advanced abstract algebra course they take as part of their degree.\nNevertheless, the content of the course is not just a sequence of theorems and proofs.\nYou are expected to learn methods of algebraic computation relating to polynomials in several variables.\n\nSolving equations has been a driving force of algebra at least since the Babylonians learned to solve quadratic equations some 3700 years ago. The subject matter of this course is, however, informed by more recent developments.\n\nThe work of Hilbert in late 19th - 20th century was key to the modern treatment of multivariate polynomials and provided a basis for commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. His result that every (consistent) system of polynomial equations over an algebraically closed field has at least one solution is known as the Nullstellensatz.\nBut an efficient method of finding such solutions by elimination was not found until 1965, when Buchberger invented Gröbner bases.\n\nIn the course, key theorems about the ring of polynomials in several variables will be rigorously proved.\nAlgorithms relating to polynomials will be explained and supported by examples. This includes factorising polynomials into irreducible factors and computing a Gröbner basis of an ideal.\n\nResults and methods of Commutative Algebra have applications in various branches of mathematics and computer science. Here are some puzzles which we may use in the course as an illustration for the main content. You are welcome to have a go at solving them!\n\nQuestion 1 (Fermat, 17th century).\nFind all integers a \"sandwiched\" between a square and a cube.\n\nQuestion 2.\nHow many ways are there of placing 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other? What about n queens on an n×n chessboard?\n\nQuestion 3.\nHow many distinct Sudoku boards are there? (A Sudoku board is a 9×9 square\nwith a number from 1 to 9 in each cell, satisfying the Sudoku constraints.)\n\nimages from Wikimedia commons\n\nCoursework\n\nThere will be 2 pieces of assessed coursework:\n\nAssessed homework 1 (see a link above): a take-home problem sheet\nset on Wednesday 27 February (week 5),\ndue on Tuesday 12 March (week 7) at 4pm.\n\nBlackboard-based online test: a timed, open-book test which the students complete online; multiple attempts are allowed\n\nPrevious years' exams\n\nCommutative algebra exam papers from years 2008-2012 are available here.","id":"/109","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.974385142326355,"__label__0":0.02563484199345112}}

This site especially has most math programs a beginner like you or I would need.\n\nOnce you've learned enough and need a program that doesn't exist (at least on ticalc), one should hope that you would have the ability and knowledge to write what you need by yourself or at least to search the many resources available to you on the Internet and other places. This goes for most every beginner, not just you.\n\nI'm not trying to be high and mighty by calling you and others a beginner; I still consider myself to be a beginner in many ways.\n\nhi i am taking AP Calculus. please, i am begging you. someone has to create a super program for this class. it isn't a hard class, but it takes time to solve some stuff. also, a calculus program would save me time in contests. well see you and thanks\n\nA lot of programs calculate everything for you in the background, giving you a final answer. What about a program that gives you the formula? I can't remember formula, and I don't trust values of programs, I'd prefer to just see the formula.\n\nOption 1: If it is Mirage compatible (add a \":\" to the beginning of the first line), you simply highlight it in Mirage and press \"tan(\". To the right, the properties should read either \"LOCKED:Y\" or \"L:Y\".\nOption 2: Send it to your computer (PC or Mac) and open it with 83+ Graph Link. There should be a box next to \"Protected\". Check the box.\nIf you don't have either of those two programs, e-mail me at SSpyro64@AOL.com\n\nOk, this is kind of similar.\nI'm the only person at my school who knows any bit how to program calculators, so, like anyone would do, I sell them. However, lately, people have been giving each other the programs instead of buying them from me. Is there a way to stop people from being able to send programs????\n\nthats pretty underhanded ... but, back to the point if you aren't sending then mirage its easy to send them a shell that can detect hidden progrsms and run them but not unhide them. You can send them the program from mirage so you dont have to unhide it. they will be able to run the program from the shell but if you dont give anyone mirage then they cant send them.","id":"/130","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9895249605178833,"__label__0":0.010495021939277649}}

{"text":"The content. Analysis is about the concepts of function, derivative, and integral (quoted from the preface for the Shilov's book). As a starting point in this study we will look into the structure of real line and explore some of the axioms of the real number system.\n\nThe primary focus in the initial part of the course will be on the Completeness Axiom and various equivalent forms of it. We will study in detail the concepts of limit, derivative, integral , and the series. Although you have already study all those concepts in your Calculus courses, I am sure that you will realize that there is a lot of room to improve our basic understanding of those concepts. Real Analysis is one of the key courses in the foundations of mathematics, and most of the time in this course will be spent into looking back into the foundations of Calculus. However, we would also like to use our improved understanding of\n\nCalculus to move toward the greater level of abstractions, and to learn something about some of the more \"modern\" developments of Analysis. In particular, we will study the concept of Metric Spaces a little bit.\n\n1. Program Assessment - Course Objectives Here is a concise list of course goals following the format of Math Department\n\nAssessment Plan. In Section\n\n1\n\n2 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005\n\nCourse-level Outcomes. Students shall study foundations of the real number system, limits, continuity, derivative and integral.\n\nMathematical Reasoning: Students will try to achieve an in-depth understanding of the ideas presented. This includes making sure statements and claims made are checked for accuracy, and an appropriate justification is given.\n\nProblem Solving: A number of calculus problems will be revisited, and many new solved. This course will challenge and develop students' problems solving skills to the limit.\n\nCommunication: The main mode of communication in this course will be written (homework, exams). However, in-class participation (oral communication) is essential, as well.\n\nTechnology: Use of a Computer Algebra System (Derive, Maxima) and\n\nLATEX.\n\n2. Course Philosophy and Procedure\n\nIn order to succeed in this course, you should really immerse yourself totally in doing mathematics. The key strategy in solving problems is \"not to give up\". This course is truly a problem solving course.\n\nMost of the course time will be spent on limits, derivatives, integrals, ... . You will see again some of the stuff that you are familiar with, but sooner or later you will stumble over some basic stuff that you actually do not know very well.\n\nYou should certainly build up on your strengths (the stuff you more or less know), but make sure that you do not neglect working on the weaknesses, as well. Use homework and exams as directions, but you should really guide yourself in the work of filling in the gaps in your knowledge in order to be able to meet the goals set up by the homework and exam problems.\n\nMathematics is not a spectator sport. It is learned by doing. Viterbo University is striving to be a Learner-centered institution. That entails an expectation of maturity and taking responsibility for their learning on the part of students. I see my job as one helping you succeed in this learning process.\n\nIn spite of my best efforts, I may not always manage to say things the way which best leads to your full comprehension. You can also help me by providing as much of a feedback as you can. I will try to do a formal evaluation survey around the middle of the semester. Other than that, I find the questions in class, and especially when someone comes to my office for assistance, very helpful.\n\nAs a further assistance to you:\n\n• About a week prior to any exam, you will receive a practice exam which will be, in terms of format and type of problems, very much like the actual exam.\n\n• I am asking you to keep a The Learner's Journal. This is to be a separate notebook that should contain a record of your study/practice on daily basis.\n\nI would also like you to keep a time log - date, hour from-to - for each study session. I would prefer that you use a pen for writing in that journal. If you are going to use pencil, then please do not use erasers, and in any case, do not tear pages out. For a learning to take place, you have to try to do\n\nMATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005 3 something. In trying, you are likely to make mistakes. The real learning will start taking place once you start understanding and correcting your mistakes.\n\nYou turn that journal in together with your exam, and then you will be graded for the portion of that journal that covers the period preceding that current exam. Up to 30% of the exam score is possible to earn this way.\n\nThe elements that will play the key role in grading the journal are\n\n– Organization - readability: In order to evaluate, I have to able to read it first. I should not have a difficult time navigating through those notes.\n\n– Mathematical correctness.\n\n– The quality of the work and the amount of time spent on studying.\n\n• Take-home problems: These assignments should test/help a better integration of material. Some will include more difficult problems. One of those assignments will be a group HW. In general, I encourage you to find some time to study together, but unless stated otherwise, the HW is to be written up on your own.\n\nI will try to space those assignments so that you could have some time to catch up. This should leave significant room for exploring the book on your own, and I encourage you to find your own balance between solving some problems in full, and just sketching solutions to some. You should try to read, meaning to the point where you really understand the question, most of the book problems.\n\nThe work in class, your book, HW, and practice exams should give you a pretty clear idea what is that you are expected to learn. It is your job to, perhaps through trial and error, find learning strategies that work best for you. Remember, learning is something you do, rather than something I do to you.\n\nHelp. I am used to you asking questions in class, coming to my office, working in groups, asking questions by e-mail. Hope all of that will continue.\n\nThere is a growing mount of Internet resources, too. Just go to Yahoo, or Google and search for \"real analysis\". In particular, you may want to look at\n\nSome of the HW will involve some use of technology (CAS and LATEX). The details will be given later.\n\nOne of the writing assignments will be graded in two parts - the second part will require you to come to my office and explain your reasoning, answer some questions.\n\nIn all your work, written and oral, it is essential to provide explanations, justify your reasoning.\n\nMy grading scale is\n\nA=80%, B=60% , C=40%, D > 30% .\n\nThe following exceptions to that scale are possible:\n\n• An A on the final exam (more than 180/200 points) will mean an A for the final grade as well.\n\n4 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005\n\n• If one is passing the course by the time of the final exam, but earns less than 30% points (a score less than 60/200), that will result in an F for the final grade.\n\n3. Some details and examples\n\nSpecific Course Goals. To study rigorous foundations of calculus; extend basic knowledge of functions, limits, derivatives and integrals. Students are expected to learn to state definitions and theorems precisely, and be able to prove theorems stated. In particular, the proofs involving the concept of limit are going to be of central importance.\n\nThe process of working toward those goals will involve looking back into everything you have learned in mathematics so far, and to subject those concepts to the following key questions:\n\n• What do I really know about ...?\n\n• What does ...mean?\n\n• Is what I just said about ...true?\n\n• How do I know if (why) it is true?\n\nLet me try to clarify this a little bit by looking into an example.\n\nExample: For some Math 155 students, conquering a problem such as\n\np8 + p32 −\n\np18 = 3p2\n\nrepresents a major undertaking; something they consider worth of including into their portfolio for the semester.\n\nNow, when you look at what is involved into justifying the above result, a number of problems present themselves. For example, we have to use the rule\n\npAB = pApB , A,B 0.\n\nCan you prove that rule?\n\nAnother key rule here is\n\nAC + BC = (A + B)C .\n\nHow about proving this one It is much more difficult question than one before.\n\nIn fact, it is so basic that there is nothing more basic to use as a help in proving it. So, we have to accept that rule as an axiom. Note: I would like to encourage you to read [4, Chapter 4] here!\n\nMoreover, the rules are used by applying them to \"existing\" mathematical objects (in this case, real numbers). But, what do we mean by p2. Can you prove that such a number exists? What do we even mean by asking a question like that?\n\nThe goal of this course is not only to learn how to answer the questions as those (that is how to do certain rigorous proofs), but we would also like to develop the corresponding mathematical awareness, so that we do not overlook those \"simple\" questions when solving problems.\n\nUltimately, this kind of training leads to deepening our understanding of what mathematics is about. We would like to use that improved understanding to bring about other two basic goals of this course, which are:\n\n• Move beyond the concepts we are familiar with. We will study the concept of metric spaces.\n\nFall 1999 - Final. To illustrate the goal of \"improving Calculus skills\", let's consider the final exam I gave to the Real Analysis class in Fall 1999.\n\nProblem 1. • State the definitions of a lower/upper bound of a set of real numbers.\n\n• State the definition of infimum.\n\n• State the theorem about existence of an infimum of a set bounded below.\n\n• Extra credit: Should I say \"the infimum\"?\n\n• Prove that the set\n\nS = 3,\n\n5\n\n2,\n\n7\n\n3,\n\n9\n\n4, . . . has an infimum, and find that infimum.\n\n• State the Completeness Axiom.\n\n• Prove that the Completeness Axiom is equivalent to the Infimum Theorem\n\nabove.\n\nProblem 2. Define\n\nf(x) =\n\n1Xn=1\n\nn2 + 1\n\nn! xn .\n\n(a) Use the ratio test to show that f is defined for all real x.\n\n(b) Prove that f is continuous at x = 0.\n\nProblem 3. State the definition of the derivative f0(a) of a function f at the point a of its domain.\n\nUse that definition to find the derivative of f(x) = 3x at an arbitrary point of\n\nDf .\n\nProblem 4. Find,\n\nlim\n\nx!0\n\nsin (ln (1 + x))\n\nln (1 + sin (x)) .\n\nState and prove all the rules used in the process. In the case of L'Hospital's rule, just state it. The proof would be an extra credit.\n\nProblem 5. Probably most of the functions we have encountered so far would be continuously differentiable. That is, if f is differentiable at x = a, then f0 is a continuous function at\n\nx = a.\n\nIs this statement a theorem?\n\nHint: Show that the function\n\nf(x) = (x2 sin 􀀀1\n\nx , if x 6= 0\n\n0, if x = 0\n\nis a counterexample.\n\n6 MATH 420 - REAL ANALYSIS SPRING 2005\n\nA student that has passed a Calculus sequence should have no difficulty in understanding almost all of the questions on that final. Being able to answer them completely is a different matter.\n\nAmericans with Disability Act.

{"text":"Intermediate Algebra, 1e, authored by Sherri Messersmith presents content in bite-size pieces, focusing not only on learning mathematical concepts, but also explaining the why behind those concepts. For students, learning mathematics is not just about the memorization of concepts and formulas, but it is also about the journey of learning how to problem solve. By breaking the sections down into manageable chunks, the author has identified the core places where students traditionally struggle, and then assists them in understanding that material to be successful moving forward. Proven pedagogical features, such as You Try problems after each example, reinforce a student's mastery of a concept. While teaching in the classroom, Messersmith has created worksheets for each section that fall into three categories: review worksheets/basic skills, worksheets to teach new content, and worksheets to reinforce/pull together different concepts. These worksheets are a great way to both enhance instruction and to give the students more tools to be successful in studying a given topic. The author is also an extremely popular lecturer, and finds it important to be in the video series that accompany her texts. Finally, the author finds it important to not only provide quality, but also an abundant quantity of exercises and applications. The book is accompanied by numerous useful supplements, including McGraw-Hill's online homework management system, MathZone as well as ALEKS.\n\nMESSERSMITH is rigorous enough to prepare students for the next level yet easy to read and understand.

More likely than not, if one asked those who studied mathematics in secondary school 25 years ago why they studied exponentials and logarithms, other than to learn about slide rule computation, many would say it was because the topic was a chapter in their textbook that had to be covered. One wonders why something that made a major impact on mathematics four centuries ago became so meaningless to the secondary students of the latter half of the 20th century, the \"new math\" era. Fortunately, textbooks which embody the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics today reward the student with the theory of exponents and logarithms along with the study of contemporary applications giving meaning to the study. In 1989, the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, which The Principles and Standards for School Mathematics were designed to build upon, were released. The document encouraged that attention be focused \"on the need for student awareness of the interaction between mathematics and the historical situations from which it has developed and the impact that interaction has on or culture and our lives\" (p.6). There is no doubt that the study of the history of exponents and logarithms is a prime example of how \"theoretical mathematics (which) has burgeoned in its diversity and deepened in its complexity and abstraction...has become more ... vital to our technologically oriented society\" (p.6). Goals of the Module: 1. To understand the historical background leading to the development of exponents, exponentials, and logarithms and to see how mathematical concepts evolve over periods of time. 2. To provide students with opportunities to apply their knowledge of exponents and logarithms to various concrete situations and problems in a historical context. 3. To show students the connection between exponential functions and logarithmic functions, that is the inverse relationship they share with one another. 4. To develop in students an appreciation of the history connected with the development of exponents and logarithms.\n4\nHow to use this module: The authors realize this module contains more material than most teachers can squeeze into an already overcrowded syllabus. It is recommended that the teacher review the material and pick and choose those topics that best fit teacher and students' needs. The material can be made to fit many different types of objectives, and it can be made to fit many different lesson plans. It may even be of interest to teachers of subjects other than mathematics. General historical material may be used for group or whole class discussion. Some quotations and biographical sketches may be more appropriate for introductory material while some are best used within activities. Students should be able to locate the places mentioned on a world map. The written assignments that are required in some of the activities could also include connections with units in social studies, science, economics, etc. If more comprehensive studies are required or desired, the authors have included a bibliography for students and teachers interested in the further study of content in the module. Time Schedule Time needed will depend on the activities and materials the individual teacher chooses to use and the level of the class. The activities may be used to introduce the topic and then further work may be accomplished using exercises found in student textbooks. The teacher is in no way obliged to ask students to perform all these activities; one is not constrained to follow the suggested sequence in which the activities are listed nor to follow the teacher hints. The authors believe that the history will enable students to understand the mathematics better. It is further suggested that the mathematics teacher team teach parts of this module with a history or social science teacher, if such an arrangement can be made. Materials Needed It is highly recommended that the teacher post a world map. Other materials which may be needed in these activities are: machine tape, straightedge, compass, ruler, lined paper, graphing paper, graphing calculator or graphing utility, computers. .Classroom Organization: When using the exploratory activities and projects of this module appears to be the appropriate time to have the class organized into cooperative groups. Using a constructivist approach, the lessons have been created with questions or hints that are designed to guide the student toward \"discovering\" the relevant results. The quotations of mathematicians may be best presented to the class as a whole on overhead transparencies; copies may be made for personal study by the students.\n5\nSuggested Courses for Using Module Activities\nActivity Exponent Notation According to Newton Properties of Exponential Functions Properties of Exponents Compound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase What Will Happen If....?

Lord Moulton, The Invention of Logarithms, Its Genesis and Growth (NTV, 21) The discovery of logarithms is attributed to the Scottish mathematician John Napier; in this section, you will be able to learn about Napier's life, how he formulated the first view of logarithms, and how they were quickly transformed during his own lifetime into something different. The temptation is severe to recast all of Napier's work through the lens of our present interpretation of logarithms, but the actual story is every bit as impressive. Moulton's quote above is useful to keep in mind when we consider the path which Napier took. John Napier was born into an influential and well-to-do family in 1550 in the family estate at Murchiston Castle near Edinburgh, Scotland as the eldest son of Archibald and Janet Napier. Before his death (also at Murchiston) in 1617, he was to become a theologian and an ardent supporter of the Protestant faith, an inventor of weaponry, and an exceptional mathematician. In mathematics, he was known for his work on spherical trigonometry, his invention of an early form of a mechanical calculator, and in particular, his discovery of and work with logarithms. It is also the case that Napier's name was spelled a variety of different ways, including by himself, among them being: Napeir, Nepeir, Neper, Nepper, Naper, Napare, and Naipper. We will adopt the spelling in ordinary usage at the present time. We really know quite little about Napier's early life. It seems he was a student at University of St. Andrews, but he never earned a degree there. He may have traveled abroad, but by 1571 he had returned to the family estates in Scotland where he remained for the rest of his life. He married Elizabeth Stirling in 1572, and after she died in 1579, he married Agnes Chisholm. He had a son and a daughter by his first wife and five sons and five daughters by his second. At this time in Scotland, religious strive was rampant. King James VI of Scotland had designs on the English throne, and there were rumors of the involvement of King Philip II of Spain in those plans. The issue of whether Scotland would become Catholic or Protestant became a widespread concern, and Napier came down very firmly on the side of the Protestants. Scotland suffered through a civil war in 1570-72, and in 1588 the English defeated the Spanish Armada. In 1593 Napier wrote the Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John; to gain a sense of this book, consider the following quote from a letter addressed to King James which formed the dedication: \"...let it be your Majesty's continuall study...to reforme the universall enormities of your country, and first...to begin at your Majesty's owne house, familie and court, and purge the same of all suspicion of Papists and Atheists and Newtralls...\" (NTV, 42) The book was widely read; between 1593 and 1645 there were 5 English editions, 2 Dutch editions, 5 French editions, and 3 in German. In it, among other things, Napier declared the Pope to be the Antichrist and predicted \"that the day of God's judgement appears to fall betwixt the years of Christ 1688 and 1700.\"\n10\nThere is strong evidence that probably as early as 1594, Napier had begun to investigate certain properties of calculations which would make working with the trigonometric values of sines considerably easier to do in order to facilitate the computations involved in astronomy. The German mathematician Michael Stifel wrote the Arithmetica integra in 1544, and it contained a clear statement relating the arithmetic sequence of integers (1, 2, 3...) with the corresponding geometric sequence of 2 raised to those powers ( 2 1 , 2 2 , 2 3 , ...), and this may have suggested the possibility to Napier of using sums to compute products. Stifel even called the powers `exponents' and discussed what we would describe as \"when you multiply the numbers, you add the exponents.\" Napier was also visited by Dr. John Craig, a member of the Scottish royal court, who met had the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe in 1590 and seen some of Tycho's work with prosthaphaeresis. This was a long-known method of using \"product to sum\" formulas: namely, such trigonometric identities as 2 cos x cos y = cos(x + y) + cos(x y). Whatever the impetus, in 1614 Napier published the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) and then posthumously in 1619 the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio (Construction of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms) was published. It appears as if Napier wished his work to be as widely accessible as possible, and to this end he aided in Edward Wright's translation of the Descriptio into English in 1616. In this translation he explained that his intent with logarithms was to aid in the calculations involved in multiplication, division, and the taking of roots: Seeing Napier coined the word `logarithm' from the Greek words logos (ratio) and arithmos (number), and his original definition takes some getting used to, compared to our present interpretation of a logarithm. Keep in mind as well that he originally was working strictly with the sines of angles. In proposition 26 in the Constructio he states: \"The logarithm of a given sine is that number which has increased arithmetically with the same velocity throughout as that with which radius began to decrease geometrically, and in the same time as radius has decreased to the given sine.\" (Napier, p. 19) T b g a S i\nIn the figure above, imagine that TS is a line segment of 10 7 units, and that bi is a ray from b. (Napier chose 10 7 for his radius so that he could use values of sines accurate to 7 decimal places but treat them as integers. It is also the case that Napier was one of the first mathematicians to widely use the decimal point as we now write it to separate the integer from the decimal fractional part of a number.) A point g starts at T and moves towards S at a rate\n11\nequal to its distance from S; at the same time that g starts at T, point a starts at b and moves towards i at the same rate as g's initial velocity. The distance from b to a is then the logarithm of the length from g to S. There are some immediate conclusions that can be reached, stressing the difference from this original view of logarithms and our present perspective. Let Nap. log stand for Napier's definition. First, if g is still at T, then the point a is still at b; therefore, Nap. log 10 7 = 0 and Nap. log is a decreasing function. Second, it can be shown that Nap. log (xy) = Nap. log x + Nap. log y Nap. log 1. Recasting Napier's description in the language of differential equations and x solving, it is possible to demonstrate that Nap. log x = 10 7 log 1 7 ; however, it is critical to 10\ne\nstress that Napier did not interpret his logarithms in anything approaching the modern sense of an exponent for some given base. It may be reassuring to us to solve a differential equation to obtain something more familiar, but Napier's vision clearly did not start there. From the top of the mountain, we can see that Napier's path and our more recent path of regarding logarithms as exponents clearly both get us to the top, but the paths themselves are very, very different. Napier regarded one of the essential properties of logarithms as \"the logarithms of similarly proportioned sines are equidifferent.\" (Napier, p. 23) In other words, for a given k, log (kx) log x = log (ky) log y. This can clearly be considered, in light of the laws of logarithms ky kx which Napier himself knew, as equivalent to log = log . In another interesting side x y note, Napier's proposition 51 states: \"All sines in the proportion of two to one have 6931469.22 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) This statement is closely related to the fact that the natural logarithm of 2 is .693147180. Henry Briggs (1561 1630) was an English mathematician and professor of geometry at Gresham House, London at the time he met Napier; he went on to become the first Savilian professor of geometry at Merton College, Oxford. After having read the Descriptio, he went to Edinburgh in 1615 to meet with Napier. It is somewhat unusual in scientific history, but the two men immediately hit it off and in fact worked with each other until Napier's death in 1617. In 1617 with the publication of Logarithmorum chilias prima and in 1624 with Arithmetica logarithmica Briggs implemented the changes in Napier's logarithmic scheme that he and Napier had considered. Quoting from the preface to the Arithmetica logarithmica: That these logarithms differ from those which that illustrious man, the Baron of Merchiston, must not surprise you...concerning that matter I wrote immediately to the author himself...I journeyed to Edinburgh, where, being most hospitably received by him, I lingered for a whole month. But as we talked over the change in the logarithms he said that he had for some time been of the same opinion and had wished to accomplish it; he had however published those he had already prepared until he could construct more convenient ones if his affairs and his health would admit of it. But he was of the opinion that the change should be effected in this manner, that 0 should be the logarithm of unity and 10000000000\n12\nthat of the whole sine; which I could not but admit was by far the most convenient. (NTV, p. 126) It seems clear that Napier had already begun to consider a more accessible approach to his logarithms, and that Briggs' suggestions helped moved him in that direction. (As Napier himself observed at the end of his table of logarithms in the Constructio: \"Nothing is perfect at birth.\" (Napier, p. 87.)) Since the logarithm of 1 becomes 0, this simplifies greatly the computational algorithms that Napier had already discovered, bringing them in line with our present theorems of logarithms. In the Constructio, an appendix was included \"On the Construction of another and better kind of Logarithms, namely one in which the Logarithm of unity is 0.\" In this, Napier suggested but in fact did not do a revision of his own system, reflecting what he and Briggs had already determined would make computations with logarithms easier. Napier also observed in the Constructio that in this case, \"if two numbers with known Logarithms be multiplied together, forming a third; the sum of their Logarithms will be the Logarithm of the third\" (Napier, p. 50) (in other words, when you multiply, you add) and went on to state all the other familiar laws of logarithms which we use. He went ahead and then observed \"whence the only difficulty is in finding the Logarithms of the prime numbers\" (Napier, p. 51). Briggs went ahead with his own work after Napier's death, and the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica contain what is for all intents and purposes the first table of common logarithms i.e., base 10 logarithms. One of the sections of this module discussed how to calculate logarithms somewhat in the method of Napier and Briggs. However, to get a sense of what they went through, consider the following. In constructing his tables, Napier started with the value of his radius 10,000,000 and began successive multiplications of that by 1-10 -7 ; in more modern terms, he generated the terms of a geometric sequence whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -7 . Moulton argues that in performing this process some 100 times, Napier became aware that decreasing a number by the same ratio each time was equivalent to repeatedly decreasing a line segment by the same proportional length, possibly giving rise to Napier's definition of a logarithm. It may have also been the case that through the sheer effort of this work, Napier eventually saw the utility of having (in modern terms) log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 1, but that he needed to go through the tremendous labor of the first construction to reach that conclusion. It is therefore tempting now to claim Napier must have therefore seen that he was constructing a system where the logarithm corresponded to the necessary power of 10 needed to obtain the given number, but that again is our view from the mountain, not Napier's. After working through the first 100 terms (his first table), Napier apparently became aware of the tremendous work left, so he changed to a geometric series whose first term was 10 7 and whose ratio was 1-10 -5 . He carried this out for 50 more terms, giving a second table. He then created two other series in a third table, one having ratio 1- 1/2000 and one having ratio 1 - 1/100. Using the data he had accumulated with his three tables, he was then able to calculate the logarithm values of numbers from 10 7 to almost exactly 5 x 10 6 . It is small wonder that Napier worked on his tables for 20 years before he published them! In the Logarithmorum chilias prima and the Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs approached the problem differently. He began with log 10 = 1 and then began taking successive square roots, using well-known algorithms for the computations needed for the roots. (For\n13\nexample, if 10 = 3.162277, then log 3.162277 = .5.) Once Briggs obtained the logarithms of the primes, it was easy, using the laws of logarithms, to then generate the values of the logarithms of composite numbers. It may be somewhat astonishing to realize the work required by Briggs to obtain, in Arithmetica logarithmica, the logarithms of all natural numbers from 1 to 20,000 and 90,000 to 100,000, carried out to 14 places. (For example, in his calculations to obtain the logarithm of 2 he took 47 successive square roots.) Adriaan Vlacq a few years later completed Briggs' work and completed a table for all integers from 1 to 100,000 to 10 decimals places. (Until recently, these tables formed the basis of all modern logarithm tables.) Napier also used his idea to construct what were called \"Napier's bones\", a mechanical multiplication table. Within 7 years, William Oughtred used Napier's ideas to construct the first rectilinear slide rules, basically the first pocket calculator. Some two hundred years after Napier's publication, the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace noted that \"by shortening the labors, (Napier) doubled the life of the astronomer.\" Logarithms also present one of the instances when a given discovery must have been in the air; it now seems clear that roughly at the same time Napier was working on his own logarithms, the same essential concept occurred to the Swiss astronomer and watchmaker Joost Brgi (1552 - 1632). While the exact timing of Brgi's work is not entirely clear, he may have in fact worked on the concept before Napier did; however, it is the case that he did not publish his own tables (actually, his were tables of anti-logarithms) until 1620 in Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen. Kepler's statement on the priority issue may be of some interest: \"...(this) led the way for Justus Byrgius to the very same logarithms many years before Napier's edition, although this man, a procrastinator and guardian of his secrets, abandoned his child at birth and did not rear it for publicity.\" (Goldstine, p. 22) Brgi generated the values in his own table by starting with 10 8 and then multiplying by 1 + 10 -4 to obtain the successive terms. The ease with which the discovery of logarithms supported the massive calculations needed for astronomy and navigation generated intense interest among mathematicians. The work of Gregory of St. Vincent and his student A. A. de Sarasa by 1647 made the connection between the natural logarithm of a number a and the area bounded by the x-axis, the vertical a 1 lines x = 1 and x = a (for any a > 0) and the curve y = 1/x, what we would now call dx . x 1 (Natural logarithms are contrasted with common, or Briggsian logarithms by their base. If we use Euler's interpretation of a logarithm as the exponent of a given base, then natural logarithms use the number e = 2.718281828... as their base, while common logarithms use 10.) The Danish mathematician Nicolaus Mercator is usually credited with discovering the formula for the x2 x3 x4 expansion of the natural logarithm of x + 1 as the power series x - + - +... by 1668. 2 3 4 As early as 1664 Newton used this same idea to compute the value of the natural logarithm of 1.1 to 68 decimal places. The ground-breaking work of Newton and Leibniz in the calculus quickly suggested applications of logarithms very far indeed from Napier's original view of the technique.\n14\nIt turned out that the method that was developed to help with computational drudgery held a vital key in the new mathematics of calculus. The logarithm took on a life of its own, separate from the astonishing levels of sheer, brute arithmetic that it both replaced and which were required to establish the first logarithm tables. The logarithm continued to play a major role in computational sciences, but it had already begun to move away from its roots. As the 18th century progressed, mathematicians became increasingly aware of the necessary changes which calculus had brought to the techniques available to them, and also to the changes which were needed in their more basic structures in order to give the methods of calculus a concrete logical base. One of the more central concepts which evolved was that of a `function', namely the ability to regard an operation as the pairing of the number which was to be operated on with the number which resulted from the operation itself. In more abstract terms, it allowed mathematicians to regard the operation as an object itself, more divorced from the immediate numerical relationships. For example, while mathematicians had worked with the numerical relationships expressed in 2 2 = 4, 2 3 = 8, and so forth, they could now consider the relationship between the variables x and y in y = 2 x . This is an example of an `exponential' function, where the variable is the exponent of some positive base. Leonhard Euler, the enormously influential mathematician of the later 18th century, formulated the relationship between exponential functions and logarithmic functions when he defined log a b = c to be the case if and only if a c = b; therefore, y = a x was equivalent to the statement x = log a y. This was a long way indeed from Napier's original vision of a logarithm as involving the distances traveled by two moving points, yet it has proved to again be of critical use in many situations. It has provided a gateway into the solutions and analysis of many types of problems that would otherwise be extremely difficult to solve otherwise. An important observation therefore can be made that despite the view of many, both in the past and in present times, mathematics is indeed a changing science. A method that began as a strictly computational device had a significant impact on techniques of calculus, was featured in an important relationship of functions, and surfaced as an important problem solving technique, far from its beginnings. Until fairly recently, high school students versed in math and science were given a significant exposure to the computational methods which logarithms opened up and the mechanical devices which logarithms helped create. With the advent of inexpensive hand-held calculators, the computational roots of logarithms have become obsolete, yet the concepts which logarithms have led to continue to be of great utility. We need to be cautious whenever we decide a particular method or approach has reached a dead end; the history of logarithms provides an excellent example of how mathematics grows and develops new relationships for what may appear to be concepts and techniques which have been outgrown, but which can continue to provide important mathematics. It is often the case that when one finally does make it to the top of a mountain, after a long and difficult climb, that you find things up there very different from what you might have imagined. Vistas open up which are almost unimaginable until you reach the peak, and not only the path up but the ground below takes on a very different appearance. You can marvel at the difficulties of some paths and the ease of others, but it is difficult to not appreciate the sheer\n15\neffort required along any path to make it to the top, and especially for those who pioneered a particular path. So too it is with the concepts and computations of logarithms; whether it be Napier, Brgi, Briggs, or any of the multitude who followed them, we must continue to remember and appreciate their contributions and exertions. Questions: 1. In Proposition 5 of the Constructio Napier writes \"In numbers distinguished thus by a period in their midst, whatever is written after the period is a fraction, the denominator of which is unity with as many cyphers after it as there are figures after the period.\" (Napier, p. 8) What exactly does this appear to refer to? 2. In Proposition 52 Napier states \"All sines in the proportion of ten to one will have 23025842.34 for the difference of their logarithms.\" (Napier, p. 38) What exactly is Napier saying in modern terms? 3. In an Appendix to the Constructio, Napier writes \"Finally any common number being formed from other common numbers by multiplication, division, [raising to a power] or extraction [of a root]; its Logarithm is correspondingly formed from their Logarithms by addition, subtraction, multiplication, by 2, 3, & c. [or division by 2, 3, & c.].\" (Napier, p. 51) Translate the meaning of this statement into more modern terms. 4. In 1617, Napier published the Rabdologi where he described the construction and use of what are now called `Napier's bones' or `Napier's rods'. Find out what these were and what they were used for.\n16\nJohn Napier\n17\nLesez Euler, lesez Euler, c'est notre maitre a tous. Read Euler, read Euler!

The students may work in groups or individually. If the students need extra time to finish the problems, they could be assigned as homework. It is interesting to read the way that Newton introduced exponents and the terminology that he used. It is also interesting to note that this was part of a lecture Newton gave at Cambridge University - so your students are being exposed to the type of mathematics that was available to university students in the 1680's. An additional assignment would be to have the students write the complete passage in the background information using modern terminology.

If a is a quantity, \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means a a. There will be various answers to this. Hopefully most will find it sufficient. The solution to a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3 a2b4 = 42 x 34 = 4 4 3 3 x 3 3 = 1296 It means that the a is to multiplied together 3 times: a a a It means a a a. Since he is naming the powers, like a5 as cube-square, he is adding the powers. So a8 would be square-cube-cube or maybe square-square-square-square.\n3. 4. 5.\n24\nExponent Notation According to Newton Student Page\nHistorical Background In Sir Isaac Newton's widely read Arithmetica Universalis, many beginning algebraic topics are included. One such topic is that of exponents. This activity comes directly from one of Newton's Arithmetica Universalis, which is a collection of the material covered in his lectures at Cambridge University in England in the 1680's. The following excerpts are from the 1972 translation by D. T. Whiteside from Newton's original Latin. t From page 61: If a quantity should multiply itself, for shortness the number of factors is usually appended. Thus. Here note that a number written immediately between two variables relates always to the preceding one. Thus `3' in the quantity a3b2does not signify the b2 is to be taken 3 times, but denotes that a has twice to be multiplied into itself. Note also that these quantities are said to be of as many dimensions, powers or `dignities' as they comprise factors or quantities multiplying one another, and that the number appended is called the index of their power or dimension. Thus a2 is of two dimensions or powers, while a3, as its appended number `3' indicates is of three. Also a2 is said to be the square, a3 the cube, a4 the square-square (fourth power), a5 the square-cube (fifth power), a6 the cube-cube (sixth power), a7 the square-square-cube (seventh power) and so forth. Exercises 1. Explain what \"If a quantity should multiply itself,\" means. 2. Is the explanation Sir Isaac Newton gave his students in the following enough for you to write terms using exponents? Give your reasons why or why not. Would you be able to evaluate a2b4 if a is 4 and b is 3? \"Thus.\" 3. According to Newton what does the `3' in the expression a3b2 mean? 4. What does the phrase \"a has twice to be multiplied into itself\" mean? 5. Using Newton's method of naming powers, how would he describe the eighth power of a, a8?\n25\nProperties of Exponential Functions Teacher Notes\nThis activity is a great way to give students the opportunity to graph and observe a variety of exponential functions and then summarize their findings. Students then compare and contrast their summaries with the one written by Leonhard Euler, the great eighteenth century mathematician.

Answers will vary, but will be similar to the ones in A through C above. Students might choose negative or zero values for a. If they do, this is a good time to discuss why these values give very strange graphs, graphs which we will usually avoid. In general, in precalculus and calculus classes we generally want to talk just about continuous functions and functions whose inverses are also functions. E. Answers will vary, but will include some of the following observations. All the graphs intersect at the point (0,1). None of the graphs has negative y-values. If a > 0, as z increases, y increases. As a gets larger, the values of y increase faster as z increases. If a < 1, as z increases, y decreases. If a = 1, then y = 1; i.e. the function is constant. If a < 0, the graph jumps back and forth between positive and negative values for y as z increases. F. Answers will vary. Many students will find that their answers include some, if not all, of Euler's observations.\n28\nProperties of Exponential Functions Student Pages\nLeonhard Euler wrote the first easy-to-read precalculus book in 1748. First, see how you might figure out properties of exponential functions; then compare your summary to his. Look at a general exponential function, y = a z , and see what happens to the graph as the value of a changes. Use the same scale for all graphs. Also, you may want to use the integers from -3 to 2 for the z-values. The equation uses z instead of x because that is what Euler used. A.

Compare what you have written with the description Euler writes concisely below.\n30\nEuler gives a magnificent and clear description of an exponential function in his precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite (1748). The values of the exponential a z depend primarily on the magnitude of the constant a . If a = 1 , then we always have a z = 1 , no matter what value is given z to z . If a > 1 , then a will have a greater value if the value of z is greater than it was originally and as z goes to infinity, so also a z increases to infinity. If z = 0 , then a z = 1 ; if z < 0 , then the values of a z become less than 1 and as z goes to z - , a goes to 0. On the other hand if a < 1 but still positive, then the values of a z decrease when z increases above 0. The exponential [ a z ] increases as z 1 increases in the negative direction. Since when a < 1 , we have < 1 , and if we a 1 -z z let = b , then a = b . For this reason we can examine the case when a < 1 a from the case when a > 1 .\n31\nProperties of Exponents Teacher Notes\nThis activity gives students the opportunity to look at how a master mathematician expressed several ideas about exponents in his great precalculus book, Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite, published in 1748.

It tells how to multiply numbers with the same base, in this case 2, by adding their denominations (meaning our exponents). 8f. Chuquet's secret is the same as our answer to 8e.\n33\nProperties of Exponents Student Pages\nWhat would happen if exponents were numbers other than natural numbers? Islamic mathematicians of the 11th century were the earliest people to use negative numbers as exponents. Nicole Oresme, a French mathematician associated with the University of Paris around 1350, had some ideas about fractional exponents and even tried to explain what it would mean to have an irrational number as an exponent. In 1655, John Wallis, an English mathematician, gave a clearer explanation of fractional exponents and a few years later, Isaac Newton was able to make use of them with ease. Here, however, we look at the explanation of exponents of various types by the prolific mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1748: Let the exponential to be considered be a where a is a constant and the exponent z is a variable. Since the exponent z stands for all determined numbers, it is clear at least that all positive integers can be substituted for z to give determined 1 2 3 4 5 6 values for a , a , a , a , a , a , etc. If for z we substitute the negative integers -1, -2, -3, etc. we obtain\nz\n1 1 1 1 1 1 , , , , , , etc. If z = 0, a1 a2 a 3 a4 a5 a6 then we have a0 = 1. If we substitute a fraction for z , for instance 1 1 2 1 3 , , , , , etc., we obtain 2 3 3 4 4\nthe values more values, since the extraction of roots gives several values. However, we will consider only their primary [now called principal] values, since\n1 2 1 3 a, a 3 , a 3 , a 4 , a 4 , etc. These symbols can have two or\na a and 3 a ... In like manner we let z take irrational values, even though it is more 7 difficult to understand this concept. ... Thus a has a value which lies between 2 3 a and a ...\nfrom Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite by Leonhard Euler Some statements in that selection probably look more familiar than other statements. For example, in the first sentence Euler talks about negative exponents. In the second sentence he\n1 tells about square roots so that we understand a 2\nz\n5 2 lies between is to be thought of as a ... function. For this reason. a\n2\n= a\n1 and by implication, a 3\n= 3 a , etc.\nWe can use this to help us rewrite expressions with rational exponents as expressions with radicals instead. Complete the following using Euler's idea to rewrite the expressions using radicals.\n34\n2 1 1 2 3 = a 3 = a 2 3 = _________________ 1. a\n( )\n1 2. a 4\n= _________________\n3 3. a 4 =__________________= __________________=__________________\nThe sixth and seventh sentences refer to situations such as the fact that a given positive number has two different square roots, a positive one and a negative one. But since we want to define an exponential function, we will consider only the positive value.\n5 lies between the two 2 7 successive integers 2 and 3. Finally, Euler also suggest that one can estimate the value of a when one knows that 7 lies between the two successive integers 2 and 3.\nUse this method to estimate the following by stating the numbers between which the given number lies. Example. 4\n5 2 3 2 = _______________________________________________________________ 4. 4 2 3 = a number between 4 and 4 , that is, between 16 and 64.\n5 2 , since The next sentence suggests a method to estimate the value of a\n5. 2 6. 32\n5\n= ______________________________________________________________\n4 5 = ______________________________________________________________\n3 7. 9 2 = ________________________________________________________________\nClearly this last observation by Euler does not give very precise estimates, but it is insightful!\n8. Familiar, Yet Different, Yet Related. You are a mathematics historian; you even consider yourself a detective of sorts! As you read the selection below, think about these questions: What familiar concept is being discussed? The notation looks familiar, but wait, does it have the same meaning? Or is it a little different?\n35\nNicolas Chuquet, a mathematician who taught in Lyons, France, wrote these words sometime during the fifteenth century. He invented the notation, but its meaning has evolved somewhat since then. To understand the reason why denomination of number is added to denomination, ..., it is necessary to set down several proportional numbers beginning with 1 and arranged in a continuous sequence, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. or 3, 9, 27, etc. Numbers 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 Denomination 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nNow it is necessary to know that 1 represents and is in the place of numbers, whose denomination is 0, 2 represents [...] the first terms, whose denomination is 1. 4 holds the place of the second terms, whose denomination is 2. And 8 is in the place of the third terms, 16 holds the place of the fourth terms, 32 represents the fifth terms, and so for the others. Now whoever multiplies 1 by 1, it comes to 1, and because 1 multiplied by 1 does not change at all, neither does any other number when it is multiplied by 1 increase or diminish, and for this consideration, whoever multiplies a number by a number, it comes to a number, whose denomination is 0. And whoever adds 0 to 0 makes 0. Afterwards, whoever multiplies 2, which is the first number by 1, which is a number, the multiplication comes to 2; then afterwards, whoever adds their denominations, which are 0 and 1, it makes 1; thus the multiplication comes to 21. And from this it comes that when one multiplies numbers by first terms or vice versa, it comes to first terms. Also whoever multiplies 21 by 21, it comes to 4 which is a second number. Thus the multiplication amounts to 42. For 2 multiplied by 2 makes 4 when adding the\n36\ndenominations, that is 1 with 1, makes 2. And from this it comes that whoever multiplies first terms by first terms, it comes to second terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 21 by 42, it comes to 83. For 2 multiplied by 4 and 1 added with 2 makes 83. And thus whoever multiplies first terms by second terms, it comes to third terms. Also, whoever multiplies 42 by 42, it comes to 16 which is a fourth number, and for this reason whoever multiplies second terms by second terms, it comes to fourth terms. Likewise whoever multiplies 4 which is a second number by 8 which is a third number makes 32 which is a fifth number. And thus whoever multiplies second terms by third terms or vice versa, it comes to fifth terms. And third terms by fourth terms comes to 7th terms, and fourth terms by fourth terms, it comes to 8th terms, and so for the others. In this discussion there is manifest a secret which is in the proportional numbers. It is that whoever multiplies a proportional number by itself, it comes to the number of the double of its denomination, as, whoever multiplies 8 which is a third number by itself, it comes to 64 which is a sixth. And 16 which is a fourth number multiplied by itself should come to 256, which is an eighth. And whoever multiplies 128 which is the 7th proportional by 512 which is the 9th, it should come to 65536 which is the 16th. from N. Chuquet, pp. 144, 151-153 a.

Compound interest holds much promise for applying mathematical ideas to relatively important everyday applications, such as the amount of money an investor makes on a particular investment, a notion Americans are familiar with living in a capitalist society. The need to understand compound interest also arises in calculating the interest that accrues on credit card purchases, car, home, and boat loans, and financial investments. In the following activity, a historical example is used as a springboard to discuss compound interest. The historical context is centered on the European colonist's purchase of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Level: Algebra I, Algebra II, Precalculus (Exposure to the compound interest formula is a prerequisite.) Objective: To investigate an application of exponential growth, compound interest, using an situation taken from the historical context of the Dutch \"purchase\" of the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans. Materials: Student Page; Calculator; Graphing calculator and Internet access (optional) Time Frame: Two 45-minute class periods; extended project would be done outside of class How to Use: To begin the discussion of exponential growth and compound interest embedded in a historical context, provide students with the historical opener on an overhead transparency (see Transparency #1). Have students read and reflect on this historical situation. You might ask students to develop their own questions that arise from the historical situation presented. Be prepared to consider social and historical questions as well as mathematical related questions. A second option would be to use the guiding questions in the student activity to develop the lesson. One way to begin the lesson is to look at question 1 involving compound interest. First, it might be helpful to review the general compound interest formula. You might also show students the derivation for the general compound interest formula. It might be helpful to derive the compound interest formula using an example first. Then show the students the formal algebraic derivation for the compound interest formula. Consider the following example involving compound interest. You have $100. You want to invest your money in a fund that guarantees 8% interest compounded quarterly over six years. You have the following given information: r = 8% = 0.08 annual interest rate t=6 time in years\n38\nn=4 number of compounding periods per year nt = 24 number of compounding periods P = $100 principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods Because we are looking for the total amount of money at the end of 24 periods, we want to find S 24 . Guide the students through the derivation using the above given information. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is 0.08 S1 = 100 + 100 = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is 0.08 2 S 2 = S1 + S1 = S1 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02)(1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 The total amount of money we have at the end of the third compounding period is 0.08 2 3 S3 = S 2 + S2 = S 2 (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) (1 + 0.02) = 100(1 + 0.02) . 4 Explain to your students that we are looking for S 24 ; that is, the total amount of money we have accumulated at the end of the 24th period. Next guide students to the algebraic derivation of the general compound interest. We have the following given information: r = annual interest rate t = time in years n = number of compounding periods per year nt = total number of compounding periods P = principal amount of money being invested S n = total amount of money at the end of n periods r = interest rate per compounding period n nt = total number of compounding periods. The total amount of money we have at the end of the first compounding period is r r S 1 = P + P = P 1 + n n\n39\nThe total amount of money we have at the end of the second compounding period is r r r r r r r S 2 = S1 + S1 = P1 + + P1 + = P1 + 1 + = P1 + . n n n n n n n The total amount of money we have at the end of the nt -th compounding period is S nt = P1 + r . n\nnt 2\nUsing the derivation of the general compound interest formula, lead students to the exponential equation that describes the situation described in the historical opener. Let P = 24, r = 7%, n = 1 (compounded annually) and t = 372 (the number of years since 1626 this is being calculated for the year 1998) r y = S nt = P1 + n 0.07 y = 241 + 1\nnt\n(1)( 372 )\ny = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410\nGuide your students to discover that the initial formula for y represents an exponential growth function of the form, f ( x) = ab x where a is the initial amount of money, b is the growth factor, and x is the total number of compounding periods. Stress that because b > 1 in compound interest problems, then the function is an example of exponential growth. Guide students to change a and b in f(x) = abx to see the effect on the curve. Encourage students to examine the function for a > 0, a < 0, b >1, and 0 < b < 1 and to write a complete explanation of the results they found. Have students solve additional examples of exponential growth problems either using variations on the historical opener problem or problems from a textbook. Give students an opportunity to create their own problems and to explain them to the class.\n40\nCompound Interest Activity: The Manhattan Purchase Solutions\n1. As indicated above, y = 24(1.07) 372 $2,046,334,096,410 2. The 3.8 billion dollars is less than the amount found in number 1, so perhaps, Minuit paid too much, or the interest rate is too high, or the tax assessment value is too low. 3. Minuit should have paid a great deal more. Land in the Old World was dear and certainly, an equivalent amount of land, in say Holland or England, would have been very expensive. But given that the amount found in number 1 is higher than the tax valuation in number 2, find a payment that would give the tax valuation. This time solve for the initial amount given that the final amount is 3.8 billion dollars and the interest rate is 7% with 372 years (this solution is being done in 1998) with annual compounding yields: 3.8 10 = a(1.07)\n9 372\n3.8 10 9 a= .044567 or about 4.5cents.

The Federal Reserve Board holds past and present interest rates. 5. f ( x) = ab x where a is the initial amount of money, b is the growth factor, and x is the total number of compounding periods. 6.

This famous mathematics book was written by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in the middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that this problem appears in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum shows that issues of population growth were of concern to the people living in the eighteenth century. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. However, this activity is designed to solve the problem using exponential functions first. Later, when logarithms and logarithmic functions are developed in the module, you can show students how to solve this problem using logarithms. Showing students how to solve this problem using both exponential and logarithmic functions provides a wonderful opportunity to reveal the inherent connection between exponential and logarithmic functions.

It helps explain why a mathematical model may need to change with the passing decades. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry (Prerequisites: Using various regression equations on a graphing utility to describe data) Objective: To study various regression equations culminating in the need for the logistic equation to model real-world data Materials: Overhead projector; transparency made from the Population Data; Graphing calculators with regression equation capabilities, including the logistic function Time Frame: One class period How to Use: This activity works very well as a teacher-guided discussion with the everexpanding data set being modeled by successive functions. It helps the students see that as more and more data is available a model may need to change in order to make better predictions. 1. Perhaps begin by asking students which statistics about New York City might be valuable and why. Lead them to realize that population trends might prove useful in city planning in such areas as number and size of schools, sewage treatment and garbage collection, road construction and maintenance. 2. Using the historical information in the lesson discuss past efforts in history to solve similar prediction problems. 3. Ask students to look at the initial data set and imagine that they are city planners for NYC after the 1820 census and that they need to predict the population for the next few decades. Have them enter the data into lists on their calculators or computers, make a scatterplot of the data and fit an appropriate regression function to the data. Then have them predict the population for the next decade. 4. Ask students to pretend that a couple decades have passed and ask if their prediction was good for 1840. Now have them add this data to their previous lists, make another scatterplot incorporating all the data from 1790 through 1880, choose an appropriate regression function and predict the population for the next decade. Some students may try a quadratic regression function. It actually appears to fit the data better than the exponential function. You may want to tell them that fitting the data is not the only criterion for choosing a particular regression equation. For example, the quadratic function would imply that at first the population of NYC would decrease during the first decade under consideration. While that is\n54\npossible, it doesn't fit the real data that is ever increasing. They may point out that the exponential function overestimates the population in the final decade of this data set. That will point the way to needing a different regression function, a suspicion that is confirmed by the next data set. 5. For the third data set, after plotting additional points, students may suggest that it is composed of several parts, such as exponential for the first third, quadratic for the second third, and logarithmic for the final third. You can then suggest that this S-shape is characteristic of the logistic function and students may use their TI-83 graphing calculators to fit a regression function to the data. 6. For the final data set, after plotting the additional points, students may decide it is best described as a cubic function, but you may want to point out that a cubic equation would have predicted a negative population for the first three decades of the 1800's. 7. A discussion of possible reasons why the population growth rate slows down in the final set is a lively finale to this activity. Students may bring up such possibilities as population density, insufficient water/sewage treatment plants, insufficient medical services for a greater population, not enough roads or public transportation, not enough schools to support a greater population.

We will also consider the entire concept of using mathematics to model a real-world situation. An important use of mathematics is its ability to take current numerical information, or data, and then make predictions of future behavior based on that data. A useful field of investigation is that of population growth, with its obvious impact on city planning, environmental concerns, allocation of resources, and many other areas. Data from previous years can indicate important trends; social scientists, economists, and many other professionals have discovered that one can also use data to predict future growth patterns. We will use data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census on the population of New York City to investigate three different predictive models. One simple possibility for population growth is that the growth is constant; in other words, that the population grows by the same amount each year. The population can then be depicted mathematically with an \"arithmetic\" sequence, a sequence of numbers where any two successive terms differ by the same amount. An example of an arithmetic sequence is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17... A more complicated model uses the premise that the growth is proportional to the present population; in other words, the larger the population, the more people are added each year. In this situation, we often say that the growth rate, say r%, is constant. The population in this case can be represented by a \"geometric\" sequence, one where any two successive terms have the same ratio. An example of a geometric sequence is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... A third model uses the idea that the growth of the population will be proportional to two factors: the current population and also how close the population gets to some ceiling or maximal size. This model implies that initial growth may be faster, but as the constraints of resources come into play, then the growth will slow down. The full mathematical development of these three models requires techniques of calculus, and therefore we will not dwell unnecessarily on the methods used to obtain the equations. However, we can briefly summarize the central mathematical conclusions. In the first model the population y will be a linear function of time t, that is, the population y will be given by the familiar formula y = mt + b. The second model results in an exponential model of growth, in which the population y is expressed by y = y 0 e rt where y 0 is some given initial value, r is the rate, t is the time and e is the familiar 2.718... The third model results in the logistic model of c , where for the additional variables, c represents the maximal population growth, y = 1 + ae ( - bt ) which can be sustained (called the \"carrying capacity\") and a and b are constants which emerge from a particular set of data.\n56\nLet's consider the use of these three models with the same overall set of data, restricted to different time periods. The U. S. Bureau of the Census contains a myriad of information about populations of various segments of the United States from 1790 until the present. (The Constitution of the United States orders that a count of the population be held every 10 years in order to correctly apportion the seats in the House of Representatives; this raw data can then be used in variety of ways to gain interesting information about patterns of growth in the U. S.) One such set of information is the population of New York City as measured every 10 years in the Census. For the period of 1790 to 1820, the Census gives the following counts: Year Population 1790 33,131 1800 60,515 1810 96,373 1820 123,706\nUsing your graphing calculator, plot those four points using the Year as the x-coordinate and the Population as the y-coordinate and a suitable viewing rectangle; you should obtain something which resembles Chart 1. It should be pretty clear that these four data points look like they almost fall on a line; you can use the capabilities of your particular calculator to discover the regression equation line which will fit the data which gives you an answer of y = 3075.83x 5,473,441.9. Graph that equation over the set of data to observe how good a fit it is. However, you test a model by not only how well it fits given data but also how well it will predict the future. The count for 1830 was 202,589, and the count for 1840 was 312,710. According to the equation above you should expect the count for 1830 to be 155,327 and the count for 1840 to be 186,085; clearly, the mathematical model is at odds with the real data. The linear model does not account for the complexity of the information and significantly undercounts the real population. Let's consider more of the set of data next; to the data given above for 1790 to 1820, expand the data set to include the following through 1880: Year Pop. 1830 202,589 1840 312,710 1850 515,547 1860 813,669 1870 942,292 1880 1,206,299\nGraphing these in a suitable viewing rectangle should yield something resembling Chart 2. This graph should look like the graph of an exponential function, examples of which you have already seen. You can again use the capabilities of your calculator to obtain an exponential function that fits the data, yielding y = (11162 10 -27 )e .040578 x . Graph that function over the data set, and . again note the fit. Using our previous approach, the census count for 1890 was 1,515,301 and the count for 1900 was 3,437,202; our equation predicts that the figure for 1890 should be 2,265,258 and for 1900 it should be 3,398.969. The exponential equation fits the given data well, but again it is less useful when we try to expand it to cover a broader scope. Now we will consider more data; we expand the data set to include the population through 1950:\n57\n1890 1,515,301\n1900 3,437,202\n1910 4,766,883\n1920 5,620,048\n1930 6,930,446\n1940 7,454,995\n1950 7,891,957\nGraph the population from 1790 through 1950, and note how the graph initially increases very rapidly, but then levels off and increases much more slowly. Compare your graph to Chart 3. This `S' shape is highly suggestive of the model of logistic growth. If your calculator is advanced enough, you can use the set of data from 1790 to 1950 to obtain a logistic equation that 8,592,944.078 models the information; if not use y = . Again, map this function 1 + (12224 10 50 )e ( -.060438 x ) . over the data set, and observe the fit. To get a better sense of the implication of such a model, extend the domain of your graph to 2050 and the range to 9,000,000 and now consider it. Notice how the curve flattens out. What is the implication of such a graph? Now, let's consider the full range of data through the 1990 census. Include in your data the following: Year Population 1960 7,781,984 1970 7,894,862 1980 7,071,639 1990 7,322,564\nThe graph of the full set of data is in Chart 4; make sure your graph is similar. Note the strong fit of the curve through the data of 1950, and then how the curve fails to model the data, particularly in 1980 and 1990. Some conclusions: The first matter for us to consider here is the history of some of these models. The simplest concept of growth is one that results in an arithmetic pattern; early scientific consideration of population growth of crops and domesticated animals demonstrated this model was not sufficient to explain the observed growth. Thomas Malthus (1766 1834) was an English clergyman and political economist who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798. In there, he wrote that \"population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio.\" When this idea was investigated mathematically, it resulted in the exponential model expressed above. Pierre Francois Verhulst (1804 1849) was a Belgian mathematician and statistician who is credited with first writing about the logistic model of growth in 1845, when he attempted to take into account factors, such as limited resources, that would also tend to slow down growth after time. (Our logistic equation is written in the form y = f(t); Verhulst wrote it in the form t = h(y). This form requires the use of logarithms, and apparently he coined the word `logistic' to suggest the connection between the curve and the characteristic shape of a logarithm.) Next, we need to consider the whole concept of a model in and of itself. First, one point is to recognize that while a mathematical model may fit a particular set of data, it is a somewhat dangerous perspective to feel that the model will always work. We considered three models linear, exponential, and then logistic which did a reasonable job with one set of data, but then became less accurate as the data encompassed a larger time frame. There is a danger in assuming that we can ever exactly describe a living situation with a mathematical model. There are\n58\ntechniques of chaos theory that we could call on to account for the fluctuations in the data we considered in the periods of time following 1950, but what is to say that the future data will fit this model as well? It may be that all we can ever hope for is a rough description of a living entity without ever attaining any sort of permanent exactness. Second, mathematics expands to generate more sophisticated techniques as more data is made available. Malthus had a reasonable perspective, given his time; Verhulst developed a better one, but not necessarily because he was somehow smarter he had access to more information. Complicated models require equally complicated mathematics even to obtain approximate correlation with real-world data. We can even incorporate the new field of chaos theory to further refine our model. Third, we need to be careful about assuming that just because we can describe a set of data mathematically, we have somehow discovered what is creating the data. The Americans Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed independently rediscovered Verhulst's analysis of population growth in 1920. They cautioned: \"No process of empirically graduating raw data with a curve can in and of itself demonstrate the fundamental law which causes the occurring change.\" In other words, do not mistake an ability to describe a set of data with a mathematical formula with understanding what is creating the data itself. It may be that the mathematics helps us to see some underlying principles, but the ability to extrapolate the future from a set of data is at best an inexact procedure. However, in the article which they wrote to discuss the mathematics of logistic growth and its application to population modeling, Reed and Pearl concluded: \"...the hypothesis here advanced as to the law of population growth [that of logistic growth]...so closely describes the known facts regarding the past history of that growth, as to make it potentially profitable to continue the mathematical development and refinement of the hypothesis further.\" It may still be very useful for us to study the particular model, realizing that we still do not have a full mathematical description of the phenomena being studied. In an article appearing in the March, 1998 edition of the journal Primus on the logistic curve, Bonnie Shulman warns that while the difference between the mathematics of a model and the underlying dynamics may be clear to mathematicians, \"important policy decisions are made based on the predictions arising from models.\" It is perfectly understandable that we would use mathematical models to try to predict the future, but those predictions must always be taken with a sense of caution. Biologists have studied population growth of various species extensively, and as such have repeatedly come across examples of logistic growth. Even at that, in Population Biology of Plants, John L. Harper states: \"The logistic curve remains central to population biology, not because it describes how populations behave but rather because it provides a standard base of ideal behavior against which the reality can be judged and measured.\" (Harper, p. 3.)\n59\nChart 1:\n150000 100000 50000 0 1790 1795 1800\n1790-1820\n1805 year\n1810\n1815\n1820 Series1\nChart 2:\n1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 600000 400000 200000 0 1780 1790 1800 1810 1820\n1790-1880\nSeries1\n1830 year\n1840\n1850\n1860\n1870\n1880\nChart 3:\n8000000 7000000 6000000 5000000 4000000 3000000 2000000 1000000 0 1750 1800\n1790-1950\nSeries1\n1850 year\n1900\n1950\n60\n1790 1800 1810 1820 1830 1840 1850 1860 1870 1880 1890 1900 1910 1920\n33131 60515 96373 123706 202589 312710 515547 813669 942292 1206299 1515301 3437212 4766883 5620084\n61\nNewton's Law of Cooling Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: In this activity students read a little history behind Newton's Law of Cooling as well as using it. An experiment using the CBL to collect data and then mathematics to analyze it could be incorporated here as well; many books, such as the Texas Instruments book by Chris Brueningsen relating mathematics and science using the CBL collection device, are available. Level: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Exponential and logarithmic functions; Solving exponential and logarithmic equations; Best fit curves (optional) Objective: The goal of this activity is to give students an opportunity to learn the history behind Newton's Law of Cooling and then to use this law in several exercises. Materials: Graphing calculator; Internet access (optional) Time Frame: This activity can be completed in one class period with the exercises started in the class, the rest to be assigned as homework. The amount of time needed for this activity may be decreased or increased depending on the mathematical level of your students. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss the history of Newton's Law of Cooling with the class after the students have had time to read the information. It might be necessary to do several examples of solving exponential and logarithmic equations before assigning this activity. If additional activities are desired, the teacher should visit the cited websites (or others that may be available) to determine the appropriateness for his/her class. Additionally, if the teacher decides to run an experiment using CBL equipment, there would need to be additional preparation on the part of the teacher. Bibliography: 1. Edwards, G. H. and David E.

Substituting T0 = 340, T(1) = 100, and Tm = 70 into Newton's Law of Cooling gives: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 100 = 70 + (340 - 70)e k (1) 30 = 270e k 30 = ek 270 1 1 = e k ln = k . 9 9 1 k can be left in this form, or it can be evaluated : k = ln -2.1972 9 kt ln(1/9)t ln(1/9) t t b. First notice that e = e = (e ) = (1/9) . Now substitute the values into Newton's Law of Cooling T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 1 80 = 70 + (340 - 70) 9 1 10 = 270 9 10 1 = 270 9\nt t t\n3 1 1 1 1 = = 3 = 2t t = hours. 2 27 9 3 3 2. This time the Tm is the unknown. T0 = 200, T(10) = 150 and k = -0.05. Substituting into Newton's Law of Cooling yields: T = Tm + (T0 - Tm )e kt 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5(10) 150 = Tm + (200 - Tm )e -0.5 Multiply both sides by e0.5 . 150e0.5 = Tm e0.5 + 200 - Tm\nt\n3\n2t\n63\n150e0.5 + 200 = Tm (e0.5 - 1) 150e0.5 + 200 Tm = 72.92 e0.5 - 1 3. a.

If we substitute into the previous formula, we get C = 50 (1 2 ) 3 5 .2 9 17\nThis value is lower than the 37 C that we use. c. Again, substituting the given value for N gives us 50 C= (71) 208.82 17 Newton's value is lower than the actual value. d. There are several possible explanations. One is that Newton's values were approximations; another is that the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures is not linear. A suggested additional activity would be to use the three points (0,0), (12, 37) and (34, 100) in a different model a best fit line or a quadratic equation, for example. And then see how the new model works with the melting point of tin.\n64\nNewton's Law of Cooling Student Pages\nHistory\nBesides discovering calculus, Newton experimented in chemistry and alchemy. One of the Newton results discovered is what is now called Newton's Law of Cooling. He wrote anonymously \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\" in the 1701 volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Due to Newton's fame, Roger Cotes easily deduced that Newton was the author of the anonymous paper. Using a linseed oil thermometer, because linseed oil has a high boiling point of 240 C, Newton studied the melting points of various metals and alloys. Newton devised a method for measuring temperatures of up to 1000 C. his law of cooling. Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate at which the temperature T(t) changes in a cooling body is proportional to the difference between the temperature in the body and constant temperature Tm of the surrounding medium. If one writes this statement as a differential equation and solves, one gets Newton's Law of Cooling in the form T = Tm + (T0 - Tm)ekt where T0 is the initial temperature of the heated body at time t = 0 and where k is a constant which depends on the item being cooled. Notice that this equation is an example of exponential decay decay since k turns out to be negative because the body's temperature is decreasing.\n65\nExercises: 1. When a cake is removed from the oven, it is 340. One hour later, it has cooled to 100. If the temperature of the room is 70, a. find the constant k in Newton's Law of Cooling; b. find how long will it take for the cake to cool to 80? 2. Suppose the constant k Newton's Law of Cooling -0.05. If the temperature of a cup of coffee is 200 when it is poured and 150 10 minutes later, how warm is the room? 3. According to Newton's paper, \"A Scale of the Degrees of Heat\", he chose the following temperatures using his linseed oil thermometer: the freezing temperature of water was 0 and the boiling point of water was 34. The Celsius temperature for the freezing of water is 0 and the boiling point of water is 100. a. Find the linear equation that represents the relationship between the linseed oil temperatures and the Celsius temperatures. Let the linseed oil temperatures be the independent variable. b. Newton said that body temperature using his linseed oil thermometer was 12. Using the linear relationship you found in part a, find the Celsius temperature for body temperature. How does this compare with the 37 C that we use? c. Newton found that the melting point of tin was 71.

At the very least, consider pairing up students to work on this activity. If students have not had much work with exponential functions, you might need to help them find the Have students consider the following historical problem taken from Leonhard Euler's highly influential pre-calculus book, Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum, written in 1748: If the progression 2, 4, 16, 256, ... is formed by letting each term be the square of the preceding term, find the value of the twenty-fifth term. This example comes from Chapter VI: On Exponentials and Logarithms of Euler's book.. Euler initially solved the problem using logarithms. We simply want to graph the curve that models this progression. It is preferable to have students graph this curve using a graphing calculator. If there is no access to graphing calculators, have students make a table of values and graph the exponential function on graph paper. A suggested window for graphing is x: (0, 10) and y: (0, 300). Students must first determine the function that models this progression. The students should arrive at\ny = f ( x) = 2 2 .\nx\n67\nA sample table the students may make is as follows:\nx 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7At this time, students should find the twenty-fifth term is\n) f (25 = 22 = 216,777,216.\nStudents will quickly discover this expression cannot be evaluated on a calculator. It is important to stress that Euler solved the problem using logarithms--a topic that will be discussed later and connected with exponential functions. This example is a prelude to logarithmic functions--the inverse of exponential functions. Once the students have discovered the function and curve that modeled Euler's original problem, you can discuss the relationship between this function and the standard exponential function\n24\ny = f ( x) = 2 x.\nThen have the students make a comparison between the two functions. Note: Euler's original solution with logarithms to this example is provided (See Logarithmic Functions: Euler and Exponential Functions: An Investigation Revisited). Later in the unit when you introduce logarithms, it would be appropriate to revisit this problem and show students its connection to logarithms and Euler's logarithmic solution. This will make students aware of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions. Bibliography: Euler, Leonhard, translated. by John D. Blanton.

Level: Precalculus. A prerequisite is the Binomial Theorem and the calculation of e as in the section \"What Will Happen If...\" Objective: To show how to calculate the power series for ex Time Frame: One or two class periods, with a homework assignment at the end. How to Use: This is a teacher-directed lesson. The Student Pages should be given to the students, but the teacher will need to present this material and answer questions about it.\n73\nCalculating ex Student Pages\nWe present here a method of calculating ex by means of a power series, a polynomial of \"infinite degree.\" We first recall the Binomial Theorem: (a + b) n = a n + na n -1b + n(n - 1) n- 2 2 n(n - 1)n - 2) n -3 3 a b + a b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nYou should make up several examples of this for practice. In particular, note that the formula is somewhat simpler when a = 1. We then have (1 + b) n = 1 + nb + n(n - 1) 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2) 3 b + b + 1 2 1 2 3 + bn .\nNext, recall the result, discussed in an earlier section of this module, that e can be found by considering the expression 1 1 + n\nn\nand letting n get larger and larger. Today, we generally write this as 1 e = lim 1 + . n n This means simply that as we let n get larger and larger, the given expression gets closer and closer to a particular number, which we have called e. Euler, however, writing before the notion of limit had been explained, would simply write 1 e = 1 + , n where n is an infinitely large number. Today, we do not generally use such concepts, and probably Euler himself knew that such numbers did not really exist. But what he meant by the phrase \"infinitely large number\" was simply a very very very large number; he used his intuition then to determine what properties such very very very large numbers would have. We will see some of these properties as we work through his argument.\nn n\n74\n1 Since e = 1 + , where n is infinitely large, we can also calculate e r . First, we note n that if n is infinitely large and r is a finite quantity, then n/r is also infinitely large. We can therefore rewrite e as 1 e = 1 + n/r It follows that\nn/r 1 . e = 1 + n / r r r n/r\nn\n.\nBy one of the basic rules for exponents, we can rewrite this in the form 1 e = 1 + . n/r\nr n\nBut we know that\n1 r = .. We therefore have, finally, n/r n r er = 1 + , n\nn\nagain where n is infinitely large. r . Of n course, we know that the binomial theorem is only valid for finite values of n, but we will assume that it is also true when n is infinitely large. After all, we are thinking of such values n simply as very very very large positive integers. However, since we do not know how large n actually is, we will only calculate the first few terms of the binomial expansion and use dots to indicate that this expression simply goes on for a long long time. Technically, this \"infinite polynomial\" is called a power series. We now apply the binomial theorem to this last expression, taking a = 1 and b = We get\n75\nr e = 1 + n\nr\nn\nr n(n - 1) r n(n - 1)(n - 2) r n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) r = 1+ n + + + + 1 2 n 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 n n n = 1+ r + n(n - 1)r 2 n(n - 1)(n - 2)r 3 n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)r 4 + + + 1 2n 2 1 2 3n3 1 2 3 4n 4\n2\n3\n4\nWe want to simplify the various terms of this expression. So we have to use a property of ``infinitely large numbers.'' In particular, we note that if n is infinitely large, subtracting 1 n -1 from n will have no appreciable result. Thus = 1 . Similarly, if we subtract 2 or 3 or indeed n any finite number from n, this will not really change that infinitely large number. We therefore n-k = 1 for any finite number k. What this means, then, is that in the expression above, have n the quantities n, n 1, n 2, n 3, ... in the numerators always \"cancel\" the factors of n in the denominators. It follows that our expression reduces to er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ( k - 1) k is usually called\nYou may know that if k is any integer, the expression 1 2 3\nr\nk factorial and is written k! Thus, our expression for e , usually called its power series expansion, is written as er = 1 + r + r2 r3 r4 + + + 2! 3! 4!\nThe value of the power series expansion for Euler was that it enabled him to calculate values for e r . In particular, he could calculate the value for e1 = e . We can do it as well, by substituting r = 1 into the series. We get e = 1+1+ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + + + + 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 = 1+1+ + + + + + + + 2 6 24 120 720 5040 40320 = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.166666667 + 0.041666667 + 0.008333333 + 0.001388889 + 0.000198413 + 0.000024802 + 2.718278771 2.71828\n76\nYour calculator can, of course, calculate e as well as e r , for any r in a fraction of a second. You may wonder how it does it. Although different calculators use different procedures for doing this, one of the ways your calculator may work is, in fact, by using the series for e r ,. Your calculator is basically hard-wired to perform additions and multiplications; since calculating with a power series just involves these operations, all that has to happen is that the calculator must perform very many of these operations very quickly. And that is precisely what it can do. Although a normal graphing calculator can probably only calculate e to 10 decimal places, it has been calculated to far more places by a computer. The first 100 decimal places are as follows: e 2.71828 18284 59045 23535 02874 71352 66249 77572 47093 69995 95749 66967 62772 40766 30353 54759 45713 82178 52516 64274 Like another important number , the number e is irrational and even transcendental. The first statement was proved by Euler in 1737. That e is transcendental, that is, that it cannot be a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, was proved in 1873 by Charles Hermite. Interestingly, these two important numbers are closely related, as we will see in the next activity. Exercises: 1. Use your calculator to determine the decimal form of the next three terms in the series for e, namely, 1/9, 1/10, and 1/11. Add these values to the value already calculated and check that you now have e calculated correctly to 8 decimal places. 2. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1. Namely, replace r by 0.1 in that series and evaluate using your calculator. Check that using the terms through the fifth power term gives you accuracy to 8 decimal places. 3. Use the power series for e r to calculate e0.1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. 4. Use the power series for e r to calculate e1 and compare with the answer given directly by your calculator. How many terms do you need to use to get e1 to 8-place accuracy?\n77\nEquations using e Teacher Notes\nIntroduction: Students are intrigued by e and want to know more about where it is used.

Many students will answer parabola. 2. e is the basis of natural logarithms and is used in many real-life applications, such as population growth or radioactive decay. i is the -1 which is used for complex numbers and in many real-life applications, such as electricity. is used, for example, in the area formula for a circle and volume formulas for cylinders, cones and circles. 1 is the identity element for multiplication, just to name one reason it is special. 0 is a place holder, just to name one reason it is special.\n79\nEquations using e Student Pages\n1. Hanging link chains and two brothers Imagine a chain made of identical links, hanging from the two endpoints. You've probably seen such a curve as a barrier around a grassy plot or the wire suspended from telephone poles along a highway. Sketch below the shape of the curve formed by the chain. What shape does the curve look like? ________________________________\nYou are not alone in thinking about this. Over three hundred years ago two brothers of the famous Bernoulli family of mathematicians tried to figure out the equation that described it. In May, 1691, Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem in a scientific journal, Acta Eruditorum. A year later his younger brother Johann as well as two other famous mathematicians, Christian Huygens and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, correctly solved this problem. In fact Jakob Bernoulli was not able to solve it; he and his brother Johann had a strong rivalry as shown in this letter from Johann to a friend. \"You say that my brother proposed this problem; that is true, but does it follow that he had a solution of it then? Not at all. When he proposed this problem at my suggestion (for I was the first to think of it), neither the one nor the other of us was able to solve it; we despaired of it as insoluble, until Mr. Leibniz gave notice to the public in the Leipzig journal of 1690, p. 360, that he had solved the problem but did not publish his solution, so as to give time to other analysts, and it was this that encouraged us, my brother and me, to apply ourselves afresh. The efforts of my brother were without success; for my part, I was more fortunate, for I found the skill (I say it without boasting, why should I conceal the truth?) to solve it in full.... The next morning, filled with Joy, I ran to my brother, who was still struggling miserably with this Gordian knot without getting anywhere, always thinking like Galileo that the catenary was a parabola. Stop! Stop! I say to him, don't torture yourself anymore to try to prove the identity of the catenary with the parabola, since it is entirely false.\" quoted from e the Story of a Number, p. 141 Actually this curve is called a catenary from the Latin word catena meaning chain. The equation e ax + e - ax that describes the catenary is y = where a is a constant that is determined by the 2a density of the chain and the tension as it is held. Calculus is required to prove that this is correct.\n80\n2. The Most Beautiful Equation\ne i + 1 = 0\nMany consider this to be one of the most beautiful equations ever discovered since it incorporates five of the special numbers of mathematics. It was discovered by Leonhard Euler, a mathematician who studied and contributed to many different branches of mathematics. Why is each of the five numbers special in mathematics?\ne _______________________________________________________________ i _______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________\n1________________________________________________________________ 0________________________________________________________________ To Benjamin Pierce, one of Harvard's leading mathematicians in the nineteenth century, this formula of Euler came as something of a revelation. Having discovered it one day, he turned to his students and said: \"Gentlemen, that is surely true, it is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means. But we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth.\" (Kasner and Newman, pp. 103-104)\n81\nIntroduction to Logarithms Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus/Trigonometry properties of exponents) (Prerequisites: Properties of logarithms,\nObjective: To use original sources dealing with logarithms Materials: Transparency of Napier's justification for logarithms.

Yes 3. \"a\" is the base of the logarithm and it must be a number greater than 1. 4. The domain is positive real numbers, if the logarithm is to be real also. Part 2 5. If y = 1 in az = y, then az = 1 which implies that z = 0. But a0 = 1 corresponds to loga 1 = 0. 6. By definition, a1 = a loga a= 1, a2 = a2 loga a2 = 2, ..., an = an loga an = n 7. Since a is a positive number, 1/a, 1/a2, ... will also be positive. 1/a, 1/a2,...are less than one since the reciprocal of a positive number greater than one is a positive number less than one. (There are other explanations.) loga 1/a = loga a-1 and by the definition of logarithms, loga a-1 = y ay = a-1. Therefore, y = -1 = loga a-1. The same argument holds for the other logarithms. Part 3 8. Power rule: log yn = nz Product rule: log vy = x + y = log v + log y Quotient rule: log (y/v) = z x = log y log v 9. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. vy = axaz = ax+z so log vy = x + y. It follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. 10. Let log y = z and log v = x, By the definition of logarithms, y = az and v = ax. v/y = ax /az = ax-z so log v/y = x - y. It follows that log v/y = x - y = log v - log y. Hence, the logarithm of the quotient of two numbers is equal to the difference of the logarithms of the factors.\n84\n11. If you know the logarithm of 2 and the logarithm of 3, you know the logarithms of 6 = (2)(3), 9 = 32, 27 = 33,... , 4 = 22, 8 = 23, ..., 1.5 = 3/2, 2/3, ... 36 = 2232,...and an infinite number of other examples using just these two values. See the Student Activity Calculation of Logarithms - Using the Method of Napier and Briggs for more examples. Part 4 12. The only way for the value of a logarithm to be rational is if the number is a power of the base. There are many examples: log4 8 = 3/2 (since 8 = 43/2, i.e. 8 is a power of the base 4). 13. A surd is the square root of a number that is not a perfect square such as 2 , 5 , 7 ,...\n14 Part 5 15. The rule usually looks like this: log a n = 16. loga n = p ap = n logb n = q bq = n log10 n log10 a ap = bq a = bq/p\nSince b, p and q are all constant, a is also a constant and this value has nothing to do with n, the number whose logarithm we are evaluating. 17. Looking for log2 n = q, log10 n = p (we would know this value, since it is a base 10 logarithm) log102 = 0.3010300, also log2 2 = 1 Then p/q= 0.3010300 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277p. So, if every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2.

On Exponentials and Logarithms\n102. Just as, given a number a, for any value of z, we can find the value of y [= az], so, in turn, given a positive value for y, we would like to give a value for z, such that az = y. This value of z, insofar as it is viewed as a function of y, it is called the LOGARITHM of y. The discussion about logarithms supposes that there is some fixed constant to be substituted for a, and this number is the base for the logarithm. Having assumed this base, we say the logarithm of y is the exponent in the power az such that az = y. It has been customary to designate the logarithm of y by the symbol log y. If az = y, then z = log y. From this we understand that the base of the logarithms, although it depends on our choice, still it should be a number greater than 1. Furthermore, it is only of positive numbers that we can represent the logarithm with a real number. 103. Whatever logarithmic base we choose we always have log1 = 0, since in the equation az = y, which corresponds to z = log y, when we let y = 1 we have z = 0. From this it follows that the logarithm of a number greater than 1 will be positive, depending on the base a. Thus log a = 1, log a2 = 2, log a3 = 3, log a4 = 4, etc. and, after the fact, we know what base has been chosen, that is the number whose logarithm is equal to 1 is the logarithmic base. The logarithm of a positive number less than 1 will be negative. Notice that log 1/a = -1, log 1/a2 = -2, log 1/a3 = -3, etc., but the logarithms of negative numbers will not be real, but complex, as we have already noted. 104. In like manner if log y = z, then log y2 = 2z, log y3 = 3z, etc., and in general log yn = nz or log yn = n log y, since z = log y. If follows that the logarithm of any power of y is equal to the product of the exponent and the logarithm of y. For example logy = (z) = (log y), log1/y = log y-1/2 = -(log y), and so forth. It follows that if we know the logarithms of any number, we can find the logarithms of any power of that number. If we already know the logarithms of two numbers, for example log y = z and log v = x, since y = az and v = ax, it follows that log vy = x + y = log v + log y. Hence, the logarithm of the product of two numbers is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the factors. In like manner log (y/v) = z x = log y log v, that is, the logarithm of a quotient is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished by the logarithm of the denominator. These rules can be used to find the logarithms of many numbers from a knowledge of the logarithms of a few. 105. From what we have seen, it follows that the logarithm of a number will not be a rational number unless the given number is a power of the base a. That is, unless the number b is a power of the base a, the logarithm of b cannot be expressed as a rational number. In case b is a power of the base a, then the logarithm of b cannot be an irrational number. If, indeed, log b =\n90\nn, then an = b, but this is impossible if both a and b are rational. It is especially desirable to know the logarithms of rational numbers, since from these it is possible to find the logarithms of fractions and also surds 107. There are as many different systems of logarithms as there are different numbers which can be taken as the base a. It follows that there are an infinite number of systems of logarithms. Given two different systems of logarithms, there is a constant which relates the logarithms of the same number. If. If the logarithms of all numbers have been computed in one system, then it is an easy task, by means of this golden rule for logarithms, to find the logarithms in any other system. For example, we have logarithms for the base 10. From these we can find the logarithms with any other base, for instance the base 2. We look for the logarithm of a number n for base 2, which will be q, while the logarithm with base 10 of the same number n will be p. Since for base 10, log 2 = 0.3010300 and for base 2, log 2 = 1, then p/q = 0.3010300/1 and q = p/0.3010300 = 3.3219277. If every common logarithm is multiplied by 3.3219277 then we will have produced a table of logarithms for base 2.\n91\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: The students should be familiar with the properties of logarithms and exponents and have at least an intuitive understanding of sequences.)

S2: 2 4 8 16 32 S2: 21 22 23 24 25 64 128 26 27 256 28 512 29 1024 210 2048 211 4096 212 8192 213\nThe sequence S1 gives the power of 2 for the number in S2. 2. (8)(32) = 256 (512)(16) = 2924 = 213 = 8192 (128)( 4) = 2722 = 29 = 512\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe product is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the product of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 3. 8 in S2 corresponds to 3 in S1; 32 in S2 corresponds to 5 in S1; the product 256 corresponds to 8 = 3 + 5 in S1. In the second example, 512 corresponds to 9, 16 corresponds to 4, and the product, 8192, corresponds to 13 = 9 + 4. In the third example, 128 corresponds to 7, 4 corresponds to 2, and the product, 512, corresponds to 7 + 2 = 9. When multiplying the elements of S2, the product will always be an element of S2. This is because 2n2m = 2n+m. In words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. 32/8 = 25/23 = 25-3 = 22 = 8 512/16 = 29/24 = 29-4 = 25= 32 128/4 = 27/22 = 27-2 = 25= 32\n4. 5.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe quotient is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the quotient of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2. 6. Any two terms in S2 can be divided by considering the exponents, that is, the corresponding numbers in S1, subtracting these numbers, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. 322= (25)2 = 210 = 1026 84 = (23)4 = 212 = 4096 163 = (24)3 = 212 = 4096\n7.\n(There are many other possible examples.)\nThe power of a term in S2 is always another term of S2. This is because each element of S2 is a power of 2, so the power of elements in S2 will also be an element of S2.\n93\n8.\nAny term in S2 can be raised to a power by finding its exponent, that is, the corresponding number in S1, multiplying this number by the power, and then finding the corresponding number in S2. The easiest way would be to rewrite the number or numbers in S2 as powers of 2 and use the rules of exponents to evaluate the answer. When multiplying the numbers, add the exponents; when dividing the numbers, subtract the exponents; when raising to a power, multiply the exponent by the power.\n9.\nPart 2 Extending the Results 10. Yes the results from part 1 hold here also. The rules of exponents hold no matter what the base is. Let u = bn and v = bm in each of the following: L(u) + L(v) = L(bn) + L(bm) =n+m = L(bn+m ) = L(bn bm ) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(bn)/L(bm) = n/m = L(bn/m ) = L(bn /bm ) = L(u/v) L(uk) = L((bn)k) = L(bnk) = nk definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u and v definition of the function l definition of the function l rules of exponents definition of u and v definition of u rules of exponents definition of the function l\n11.\n94\n= k L(bn ) = k L(u)\ndefinition of the function l definition of u\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier 12. If we read sequence S3 from right to left, each number is 1 smaller than the one to its right. Thus we can extend it to the left by putting 0 to the left of 1 and then the negative integers to the left of 0. If we read sequence S4 from right to left, we see that each number comes from the one to its right by dividing by b. Since the number in S4 under 1 is b, the number to be put under 0 must be b/b = 1. Similarly, the number to be put under -1 must be 1/b. The number under -2 is then (1/b)/b = 1/b2, and so on. Yes the results from number 10 still hold. The rules of exponents hold for all integers. There are many examples that would be appropriate. We write 1/b as b-1; then 1/b2 = b-2. In general, we have 1/bn = b-n, because 1/bn in S4 is under -n in S3. The 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 can be written as 1 = b0. So a 0 exponent always means 1, while a negative exponent means 1 over the corresponding positive power of the base b. log 31 = __0_ log381 = __4_ log33 = _1__ log31/3 = _-1__ log39 = __2_ log3 1/243 = __-5_ log327 = _3__ log31/2187 = _-7\n13. 14.\n15.\nPart 4: Filling up the sequences 16. 1.0000001 1.0000002 1.0000003 1.0000004 1.0000005\nRaising 1.0000001 to a small power seems just to be 1 with 6 decimal places after the 0 and then the small power, although with more decimal places, we would find more distinctions between the numbers. In any case, these numbers are very close together, differing by only .0000001. To get to 3, however, we would need to find n such that (1.0000001)n = 3. The calculator shows that n needs to be something near 11,000,000. It is therefore not very feasible to continue the sequence in this way. 17. We must have tt = 2 because the 1 (from + ) in S1 corresponds to 2 in S2. The solution to the equation t2 = 2 is t = 2. The calculator shows that this is equal approximately to 1.414. And since we use exponents of 2 to designate numbers in S2, we also have t = 21/2. That is, 21/2 = 2. Then log2 t = log2 2 = . Since u3 = 2, we have u = 3 2 = 1.260 = 21/3. Since v3 = 4, because 2/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 2 and 2 in S1 corresponds to 4 in S2, we get v = 3 4 = 1.587 = 22/3. We could also find v by\n18.\n95\nnoting that v = u2, because 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. It follows that v = ( 3 2 )2. So there are two different ways of expressing v in radical form. Also, log2 u = 1/3 and log2 v = 2/3. 19. The number corresponding to is 4 2 = 1.189 = 21/4. The number corresponding to is 4 8 = ( 4 2 )3 = 1.682 = 23/4. The number corresponding to 3/2 is 8 = (2)3 = 2.828 = 23/2. The number corresponding to 4/3 is 3 16 = ( 3 2 )4 = 2.520 = 24/3 and the number corresponding to 5/4 is 4 32 = ( 4 2 )5 = 2.378 = 25/4. The logarithms to the base 2 of these numbers are, in each case, the fraction that we began with. The number in S2 which corresponds to the fraction m/n in S1 is 2m/n. Since the nth power of this number is 2m, corresponding to the fact that the product of m/n by n is m, we can write this number as n 2 . Also, since m/n is m times 1/n, we know that 2m/n is 21/n raised to the power m. Since 21/n is equal to n 2 , we can also write 2m/n as ( n 2 )m. The calculator shows that 2317/200 = 3 (to three decimal places) and also that 2306/109 = 7 (also to three decimal places). The sum of 317/200 and 306/109 is 95753/21800 and 2 raised to that power is equal to 21, again to three decimal places. Thus 95753/21800 in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. Answers may vary.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n96\nDevelopment of Logarithms Using Sequences Student Pages\nPart I: Relationships Consider the two following sequences: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\n1. Rewrite the numbers in sequence S2 as powers of a single number. How are the sequences related? 2. Note that when two terms of S2 are multiplied, such as 64 and 128, their product, (64)(128) = 8192, is another term of S2. Pick a few pairs of your own to multiply. Is the product always another term of S2? You may have to extend the terms in each sequence to verify your observations. 3. Note that the number in S1 corresponding to 64 is 6, while the number in S1 corresponding to 128 is 7. The number corresponding to their product, 8192, is 13, the sum of 6 and 7. In other words, multiplication in S2 corresponds to addition in S1. Check that this holds for the other pairs you picked in exercise 2. 4. In a brief paragraph, summarize what you have observed. Most importantly, give a justification for your results using rules of exponents. We will now see if similar laws hold for other mathematical operations. In particular, we will examine the operations of division and taking powers. 5. Take any two terms in S2 and divide the smaller one into the larger. Do at least three cases. In each case, check the corresponding numbers in S1 of your two terms as well as their quotient. 6. After trying several pairs of terms in S2, describe how you could divide any two terms in S2 without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand. 7. Take any term in S2 and raise it to a positive integer power. Do at least three cases. Again, observe the corresponding numbers in S1 of the terms you choose and calculate. 8. After trying several cases, describe how you could raise any term in S2 to a positive integral power without using a calculator or doing any computations by hand.\n97\n9. From the previous problems, we have seen how to multiply, divide and raise to powers by relating terms in S1 and S2 in appropriate ways. Assume that you had no calculator or computer device at your disposal. How would these relationships help you to make complex computations? Explain! Part 2 Extending the Results At this point, we should try to generalize our findings and describe them with some more general mathematical symbols or notation. To do this, let's look at the two following sequences where b > 0. S3: S4: 1 b 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 b5 6 b6 7 b7 8 b8 9 ... b9 ... n bn\nWe begin by defining a function, L(x), which has as its domain the elements of S4. The \"value\" of L(x) is its corresponding term in S3. For example L(b6)=6. In general, L(bn)=n for any positive integer n. 10. Review your results from Part 1 of the project. Do you think they hold here? In particular, use the general terms of S3 and S4 to check if the properties hold. Use algebra only to show that they are true. (Do not plug in values for b. That way, you will be showing the general relationships hold.) 11. Verify that your conclusions in number 10 are actually the following in function notation. Let u and v be terms in S4. Use algebra to show the following three properties hold. L(u) + L(v) = L(uv) L(u) - L(v) = L(u/v) L(uk) = k L(u)\nPart 3: Terminology and a Formal Introduction to Napier Now extend the Sequence S3 and S4 to the left as follows: S3 ... -5 -4 5 S4 ... 1/b 1/b4 -3 1/b3 -2 1/b2 -1 1/b 0 1 1 b1 2 b2 3 b3 4 b4 5 ... b5 ...\n12. Why is it reasonable to extend S4 to the left in the way we did? In particular, why should the number in S4 under 0 in S3 be 1? And why should the numbers in S4 under the negative values in S3 be 1 divided by powers of b? Your explanation may well be by analogy to the development of the sequences initially.\n98\n13. Do the general results from number 11 still hold? Test them out by trying a few terms in S3 and S4. Show your examples. Move on when you're convinced that the rules hold for the extended sequences. 14. How can you write the quotients at the left side of S4 in exponential notation? How would you write the 1 in S4 under the 0 in S3 in exponential notation? Give a brief definition of what a negative exponent means and what a 0 exponent means. At this point, recall our original sequences, S1 and S2: S1 S2 1 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64 7 128 8 256 9 512 10 1024 11 2048 12 4096 13 8192\nJohn Napier, the Scottish mathematician who invented logarithms, called the terms of the sequence S1 the \"logarithm\" of the corresponding terms of the sequence S2. The word \"logarithm\" is a translation of the Greek word logarithmos which comes from the Greek words meaning ratio and number; it therefore means \"the number that counts the ratios.\" For example, he called 7 the logarithm of 128. This example shows how many ratios are required for the term 128 to be found. (Note that Napier did not use base b = 2 as in S2, but the ideas are the same.) The function developed in number 11 above is a logarithmic function for base b = 2. We now replace our L notation relating numbers in S1 to those in S2 by the new notation \"log2\" (read as logarithm to the base 2). Thus we have the following results: log21 = 0, log22 = 1, log24 = 2 , log28 = 3, etc.\n15. Use this \"log\" notation above to associate the corresponding terms of the following two sequences: S5 S6 0 1 1 3 2 9 3 27 4 81 5 243 6 729 7 2187\nFind the following... log 31 = ___ log381 = ___ In general, log33 = ___ log31/3 = ___ log39 = ___ log3 1/243 = ___ log327 = ___ log31/2187 = ___\nlogba = c if and only if bc = a.\nThis is the classic modern definition of a logarithm.\n99\nAt this point it is very important to remember that Napier did not use this kind of notation! What we are doing here is trying to see the link between our modern logarithms and the theoretical ideas behind Napier's logarithms. Again, Napier started with two related sequences and then went in a very different direction than we do. Part 4 Filling up the sequences Recall that Napier's original motivation for developing logarithms was to replace multiplication and division by addition and subtraction. The use of these sequences enable us to do this on a very limited scale. We can, for example, by the use of sequences S1 and S2 replace the multiplication 16 times 32 by the addition 4 plus 5. And we can replace the division of 256 by 64 by the subtraction of 6 from 8. But what happens if we want to multiply 3 by 7? Neither of these numbers is in S2 and will not be even if we extend the row further to the left or right. What can we do about this? What we need is to have more numbers in S2. One way to accomplish this and this is essentially Napier's idea is to use a base much closer to 1 than our base of 2. Napier, in fact, used 1.0000001. So the first few terms of his sequences, which we will label S7 and S8 looked like the following: S7 S8 1 1.0000001 2 (1.0000001)2 3 (1.0000001)3 4 (1.0000001)4 5 (1.0000001)5\n16. Use your calculator to rewrite the numbers in S8 in decimal form. What do you notice about these numbers? Given that we wanted to multiply 3 by 7, about how many numbers would we need to take in the sequence S8 in order for 3 (or even a number very close to 3) to appear? Is this feasible? Napier used some very clever ideas to shorten what looks like an impossible task. Yet he nevertheless worked over twenty years on his table. We will look a somewhat different method for putting more numbers in S2. We will first fill in S1 and then try to figure out the appropriate correspondences. We begin by putting in between the 0 and the 1. We now must determine what the corresponding number in S2 must be. We will call it t. S1 S2 0 1 1 t 2 2 4 3 8 4 16 5 32 6 64\n17. To determine t, we need to use the properties of these sequences. In particular, we know that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2. Therefore, since + = 1 in S1, we must have tt = 2. (Why?) We can rewrite this equation as t2 = 2. What is t? Write the answer in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. In terms of the log2 notation, what is log2 t? 18. Now put 1/3 and 2/3 in their appropriate positions in S1. Let u be the number in S2 corresponding to 1/3 and v be the number corresponding to 2/3. Again using the property\n100\nthat addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, write an equation which u must satisfy. Solve the equation to determine u in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Then determine v similarly. (Note that instead of using the property that addition in S1 corresponds to multiplication in S2, you may wish to use the property that multiplication in S1 corresponds to taking powers in S2.) What are log2 u and log2 v? 19. Now put and in their appropriate positions in S1. As in question 18, determine the corresponding numbers in S2 in radical form, in decimal form, and in exponential form. Do the same for the numbers 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 in S1. Determine the logarithm to the base 2 of each of the numbers you have now found in S2. 20. By analogy to your solutions to problems 17, 18, and 19, determine in exponential form and in radical form the number in S2 corresponding to the fraction m/n in S1. Use explicitly one or more of the properties relating S1 to S2. Since we have now filled in S1 with as many fractions as we like, we have also filled in S2 with lots of numbers. If we want to multiply 3 by 7, we now need to determine the numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 in S2. 21. The numbers in S1 corresponding to 3 and 7 are log2 3 and log2 7, respectively. Show that log2 3 is approximately equal to 317/200 and that log2 7 is approximately 306/109. You will need to use your calculator and the general definition of a logarithm. Find the sum of 317/200 and 306/109. Show that this number in S1 corresponds to 21 in S2. 22. Find two other numbers to multiply by the method of exercise 21. You may have to experiment a bit with your calculator to do this. 23. Consult at least two reliable sources (other than the Internet) in the library and write a short biography of John Napier. Your account should include information not contained in this document. Also, find at least one major application of logarithms (not discussed in class) and briefly describe it. Your write up must be typed and be no more than two pages doublespaced. See me if you need resources to consult.\n101\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Teacher Notes\nLevel: Algebra 2 or Precalculus (Prerequisites: Properties of exponents; Properties of logarithms; Definition of logarithm) Objective: The purpose of this activity is to give the students an opportunity to investigate, on a introductory level, one way that logarithms can be calculated. Materials: Student Pages; Calculator (optional) Time Frame: One class period with homework assigned to finish the student activity. How to Use: The teacher may want to discuss briefly the included Historical Background with the class. The teacher may also want to review the definitions and properties of logarithms and exponents. It would be a beneficial for the teacher to work the activity before presenting it to the class especially to think about different ways to get the solutions, since some of the methods of solution are not unique. Additionally, the order in which to calculate the logarithms is not necessarily the numerical order, so the teacher will want to warn the students of this fact and perhaps give some hints about what to do when. Also note that these are base 10 logarithms that are being calculated. Bibliography Katz, Victor J., A History of Mathematics: An Introduction, Addison Wesley, 1998.\n102\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Solutions\nPart I: log 1 log 1 = y 10y = 1 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 1 y = 0. Therefore log 1 = 0 (this is true for logarithms of any base) At this point it might be best to find log 10 next since it is also easy to calculate: log 10 = y 10y = 10 (definition of logarithm base 10) 10y = 10 y = 1. Therefore log 10 = 1 log 2 Consider the following relationship: 210 = 1024 1000 = 103 210 103 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 210 log 103 Now use the power property of logarithms: 10 log 2 3 log 10 And solve for log 2: log 2 (3 log 10)/10 = (3 1) / 10 = 0.3 So log 2 0.30 log 3 Consider the following relationship: 37 2187 2 1093 2 103 37 2 103\nTake the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 37 log (2 103) Now use the sum property of logarithms: log 37 log 2 + log 103\n103\nNow use the power property of logarithms: 7log 3 log 2 + 3log 10 Solve for log 3: log 3 (log 2 + 3 log 10)/7 (0.30 + 31)/7 = 3.3/7 = 0.47 So log 3 0.47 log 4 Since 4 = 22, So log 4 0.6 log 5 Since 5 = 10/2, log 5 = log (10/2) = log 10 log 2 (by the difference property of logarithms.) 1 0.30 = 0.70 So log 5 0.70 log 6 Since 6 = 23 , log 6 = log (23) = log 2 + log 3 (by the sum property of logarithms.) 0.3 + 0.47 = 0.77 So log 6 0.77 log 7 Consider the following relationship: 72 = 49 50 = 102/2 72 102/2 Take the logarithm of both sides of the approximation: log 72 log 102/2 Now use the difference property of logarithms: log 72 log 102 log 2 Now use the power property of logarithms: 2 log 7 2 log 10 log 2 Solve for log 7: log 7 (2 log 10 log 2)/ 2 (21 0.30 )/2 = 1.70/2 = 0.85 So log 7 0.85 log 4 = log 22 = 2 log 2 2(0.3) = 0.6\n104\nlog 8 Since 8 = 23, So log 8 0.90 log 9 Since 9 = 32, So log 9 0.94 log 10 log 10 = 1 (see above) Solutions for Part 2: 1. 2. Since log 1 and log 10 are exact values, an equal sign is used and since the other values are approximations, the approximately equal sign is used. Since the other numbers, such as 4, 6 and 8 are products of these prime numbers, we are able to use the approximate values for the logarithms of 2, 3 and 7. Another reason would be that there is no easy way to use the definition of logarithm to find, say log 2 since by the definition, log 2 = y 10y = 2. (Suggestion for additional activity using a graphing calculator, find the intersection of the graphs of y1 = 10x and y2 = 2, to find a value for log 2.) The values are not the same because of the approximations used in the calculations in the project. The values are not exact since approximations were used for log 2, log 3 and log 7. As an example, log 6 was found using both of the approximations for log 3 and log 2. Using a calculator, log 6 = 0.7781513, while the approximation is 0.77. The difference in values is more than 0.008. Using the calculator, log 3 = 0.4771213 and log 2 = 0.30103 while the approximations were log 3 0.47 and log 2 0.30. Both of these approximations were closer to the calculator values than that of log 6. There are many examples of other relationships such as 72 = 49 = 5 10 and so on. 5. The estimate for log 2 is too large because 210 is larger than 103 log 9 = log 32 = 2 log 3 2(0.47) = 0.94 log 8 = log 23 = 3 log 2 3(0.30) = 0.90\n3. 4.\n105\nThe estimate for log 5 is too small because the approximation for log 2 is too large and this value is subtracted from an exact value resulting in an approximation that is too small. 6. There are many approaches. One possible solution is that 112 = 121 120 = 456 Taking the log of both sides gives : 2 log 11 = log 456 = log 4 + log 5 + log 6 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.77 = 2.07 So log 11 2.07/2 log 11 1.035 (the calculator value is 1.0413927)\n106\nCalculation of Logarithms Using the Method of Napier and Briggs Student Pages\nHistorical Background Briggs and Napier each spent many years in doing lengthy computations to determine logarithms. Since Napier did not use base 10 for his logarithms, but Briggs did, this project will demonstrate Briggs' approach. Keep in mind though, that we will be finding approximations for only a few common logarithms and will not have nearly the accuracy that Briggs found when he was developing his logarithm tables. Recall the definitions and properties that you know for logarithms: Definition: logb x = y by = x Sum Property of logarithms: logb(xy) = logb x + logb y Difference Property of logarithms: logb(x/y) = logb x - logb y Power Property of logarithms: logb xn = n logb x Part 1: Find approximations for the common logarithms for the positive integers 1 through 10.

{"text":"You are here\n\nTips to help make Math Simple\n\nFrustration, stress and anxiety. Do these words come to mind when you hear the word \"Math\"? Well, for those of you who are experiencing trouble with Math, here are some tips to help make the subject an easier one.\n\nRead the Book\n\nRead the assigned sections over carefully and look closely at the sample problems. Decide if you benefit more by reading before or after the instructor covers the material.\n\nDevelop a Sound Math Foundation\n\nBecause most math courses are cumulative (in other words, new concepts are added to and build upon previous concepts), it is very important that the early material be mastered thoroughly. Similarly, mastery of material from previous courses makes success in later courses more likely, so continually review and practice concepts from prior math classes.\n\nTime Management\n\nComplete all readings – especially homework assignments – as soon after they are announced as possible. And definitely complete all assignments before new material is covered since math is cumulative. This ensures that the information is fresh in one's mind and linked to prior, more fundamental information. Do your assignments early enough that you can get help with the things you do not understand.\n\nCalculator\n\nLearn how to use your calculator effectively and efficiently, especially if exams are timed and you have trouble completing tests in the allotted time. Check with the instructor about suggestions for the appropriate calculator to purchase for a class. Be sure the machine comes with an instruction manual and read the manual. Learn how to use important function keys. Get in the habit of carrying the calculator with you. It is better in the long run to become proficient with your own calculator rather than borrowing other people's calculators.\n\nShow Your Work\n\nAvoid the temptation to skip steps when solving a problem unless you are quite clear about how to proceed. This is a good habit to get into with your math homework. And definitely don't skip steps on an exam no matter how well you know the material. Why take chances (unless you're running out of time)? Showing your work allows you to locate logical or calculation mistakes more easily, and sometimes partial credit is given for the correct portions of an answer.\n\nOrganise Your Work and\n\nWrite Legibly\n\nWrite all numbers and variables clearly so they may be easily distinguished. Pay particular attention to the distinguishing lines of the numbers 4 and 9, 1 and 7 and the letters x and y.\n\nSpaces are as important in math equations as are the numbers and variables themselves. Allow enough space between different terms in an equation so it is easy to distinguish them.\n\nBe sure to line up the terms in each step of the solution, and write steps one below the other rather than to the right or left. Use lined paper or graph paper to help organise the problems on your page. Don't scrunch! Use plenty of paper to work each problem. Recycle the paper at the end of the term if you are concerned about wasting paper.\n\nSupport Services and Materials\n\nFind out about the support services and materials available to you. Support services include workbooks, study groups, self-help videos and cassettes, peer tutors, professional tutors, and instructors' office hours. Using the resources from the start of the course may help your confidence and get you off on the right foot. Minimally, make use of these resources as soon as you feel uncomfortable with the material; do not wait until it is too late!\n\nPreparation and Supplies\n\n• Being prepared for each course involves several important factors:\n\n• Complete any previously assigned homework assignments\n\n• Compile a list of questions about the previous assignments to ask the instructor","id":"/150","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9847777485847473,"__label__0":0.015242318622767925}}
{"text":"Graphs are mathematical entities whose theory facilitates the discussion of the relationships between the elements of a set. Introduced about 1870 by the pioneers of combinatorics who were then still known as geometers, graphs have recently been recognized as the most adaptable tools for certain organizational problems. After first being used in operations research, graphs have now been introduced into information theory where they have proved to ba of use in many different areas. ...\n\nThis book stresses the connection between, and the applications of, design theory to graphs and codes. Beginning with a brief introduction to design theory and the necessary background, the book also provides relevant topics for discussion from the theory of graphs and codes. ...Algorithmic Graph Theory and Perfect Graphs, first published in 1980, has become the classic introduction to the field. This new Annals edition continues to convey the message that intersection graph models are a necessary and important tool for solving real-world problems. It remains a stepping stone from which the reader may embark on one of many fascinating research trails.\n\nAs graph theory continues its explosive growth, conjectures are proved and new theorems formed. The techniques involved, which have applications in a broad spectrum of mathematics, ranging from analysis to operations research, have become more sophisticated if not more manageable. This new edition, therefore, includes new theorems (e.g. the Perfect Graph Theorem, due to Lovasz) as well as new proofs of classical results. A number of sections have been significantly revised. ...\n\nGraphs and Matrices provides a welcome addition to the rapidly expanding selection of literature in this field. As the title suggests, the book's primary focus is graph theory, with an emphasis on topics relating to linear algebra and matrix theory. Information is presented at a relatively elementary level with the view of leading the student into further research. In the first part of the book matrix preliminaries are discussed and the basic properties of graph-associated matrices highlighted.The Graphs and Models series by Bittinger, Beecher, Ellenbogen, and Penna is known for helping students \"see the math\" through its focus on visualization and technology. These books continue to maintain the features that have helped students succeed for years: focus on functions, visual emphasis, side-by-side algebraic and graphical solutions, and real-data applications.\n\nThis book is concerned with the relations between graphs, error-correcting codes and designs, in particular how techniques of graph theory and coding theory can give information about designs. A major revision and expansion of a previous volume in this series, this *** includes many examples and new results as well as improved treatments of older material. So that non-specialists will find the treatment accessible the authors have included short introductions to the three main topics. This book will be welcomed by graduate students and research mathematicians and be valuable for advanced courses in finite combinatorics. ...","id":"/152","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9493300914764404,"__label__0":0.05068988353013992}}

{"text":"Book Description\n\nRelease date: August 5, 2008 | Age Range: 11 and upEditorial Reviews\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBest known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar is also an internationally recognized mathematician. She was chosen as ABC World News Tonight's \"Person of the Week\" for writing Math Doesn't Suck and has recently been featured in Newsweek and The New York Times, and on the CBS Early Show, and NPR's Science Friday.\n--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this titleThis funny math book teaches girls that it's OK to be smart, and that they are perfectly capable of kicking a little pre-algebra butt.\n\nMcKellar takes a lightweight approach to math, but is deadly serious about it. In the prologue, she writes that \"lots of people change their majors and abandon their dreams just to avoid a couple of math classes in college.\" Girls in particular, she emphasizes, often use their fear of math to keep them from learning the skills they'll need to succeed in life, and they start backing away from the subject in middle school.\n\nAnd it's not just fear. Girls often don't see how they'll use math once they get out of school. Testimonials in Kiss My Math fight this. Stephanie Perry, the finance director for Essence magazine, explains how she uses algebraic formulas to stay on top of the magazine's financial performance. Jane Davis, financial strategist at Polo Ralph Lauren, was hired as an assistant buyer because of her facility with math. She describes determining inventory over time by finding the mean of a list of numbers.\n\nMcKellar -- famous for playing Winnie Cooper in the \"The Wonder Years\" but also a summa cum laude math graduate from UCLA -- uses simple language and lots of illustrations to teach pre-algebra. Each chapter covers a single topic, such as the distributive property or exponents. She clearly explains each topic, and includes problems for the reader to solve (answers are in the back). The author is generous with helpful notes and shortcuts.\n\nA lively, breezy writing style makes it seem as if McKellar is sitting next to the reader. She uses examples girls can relate to, like clothes shopping, working on the school play, blind dates, parties, kissing and breath mints. It's like having the perfect math tutor. (I'm not a middle school girl, of course, but I just got finished having one. My daughter is starting high school this month.)\n\nEspecially good are the entries called Danica's Diary, which are true stories from the author's life as a student, actress and mathematician. One is titled: Dumbing Ourselves Down for Guys: Why is it so Tempting? McKellar gives practical advice on how girls can avoid this common pitfall.\n\nI can't think of a better book to buy for a girl taking pre-algebra.\n\nHere's the chapter list:\n\nPart 1: Number Stuff Chapter 1: Breath Mint, Anyone? Adding and Subtracting Integers (Including Negative Numbers). Chapter 2: The Popular Crowd. The Associative and Commutative Properties. Chapter 3: Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall... Multiplying and Dividing Integers (Including Negative Numbers!) Chapter 4: A Relaxing Day at the Spa. Intro to Absolute Value. Chapter 5: Long-Distance Relationships: Are They Worth It? Mean, Median, Mode. You Said: Most Embarrassing Moments in School Poll: What Guys Really Think... About Smart Girls Quiz: Are You a Stress Case?\n\nPart 2: Variable Stuff Chapter 6: The Blind Date. Getting Cozy with Variables. Chapter 7: Backpack Too Heavy? Adding and Subtracting with Variables. Chapter 8: Something Just Went \"Squish.\" Multiplying and Dividing with Variables. Chapter 9: Do You Like Him Like Him? Combining Like Terms. Chapter 10: The Costume Party. The Distributive Property. Chapter 11: Didn't That Guy Say He Was Going to Call? Using Variables to Translate Word Problems. More Than 20 Ways to Beat Stress Math... In Jobs You Might Never Expect!\n\nPart 3: Solving for X Chapter 12: The Art of Gift Wrapping. Solving Equations. Chapter 13: Nope, She Never Gets Off the Phone. Word Problems and Variable Substitution. Chapter 14: Can a Guy Be Too Cute? Intro to Solving and Graphing Inequalities. You Said: Your Horror Stories About Procrastination Poll: What Guys Really Think... About Talented Girls Quiz: Do You Pick Truly Supportive Friends?\n\nPart 4: All About Exponents Chapter 15: Champagne and Caviar. Intro to Exponents. Chapter 16: Excuse Me, Have We Met Before? Intro to Variables with Exponents. You Said: Well... That Didn't Work! Do You Sudoku?\n\nI am a mother that went back to college later in life. One of my classes was algebra. I had math anxiety and tried to find way to wiggle my way out of this class. The algebra class was very difficult for me. I could not understand the instructor or the book. I went to tutors,family members and friends and I could not get algebra. I failed the class. I was embarrassed and angry with my myself. I needed something right away. So my boyfriend and I went to Barnes & Nobles and purchased Kiss My Math & Math Doesn't suck. (I do suggest that you purchase both). So I had a six week break before I had to take the algebra class again. I am happy to say that I passed the algebra class with a B and I am looking forward to starting MATH 209 which is the second part of algebra. Danica was easy to understand and the experiences from other young ladies helped a great deal too. Thanks Danica!\n\nDanica McKellar is a beautiful actress who is probably very well off and successful. So why did she go to UCLA to study math after being a very successful child star on the wonder years and then bother to write a book entitled Math Doesn't Suck. Well it is because she wanted to prove she was more than just a good looking actress. She had a brain and could handle math. The attitude that math is not for the ladies was a horrible prejudice in my high school years and even in this enlightened age we haven't quite gotten over it and many a capable young lady lacks the confidence and courage to try to do math. Danica is a rol model who proves that they can. Her first book was so successful and helped young middle school girls overcome their fears and lkearn that math is not really hard and can be fun and interesting whenit is approached in the riht way. So math does not suck! But in addition to convincing young girls and boys that they can learn it she became encouraged to write another book based on the encouraging emails from young ladies who benefitted from the book. Well love of math should not end with middle school and algebra, geometry and calculus are very different form the kind of math you learn in the elementary and middle schools that a good series of lectures in pre-algebra is needed to help those who become discouraged again in high school. It bothers Danica to see a girlfriend of hers give up on medical school just because calculus is required. So in the same interesting style as her first book Danica interest the high schoolers with concepts like negative numbers, mathematical inequalities, exponential functions and much more. By uncovering the mysteries of pre-algebra Danica unlocks the door to advanced levels of mathematics that students in high school need. This book is good for high school teachers and anyone else with an interest in mathematics. But it is aimed at and can help most high school girls who are capable of doing well in math and nedd it for the careers they seek, like med school.","id":"/157","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9601507782936096,"__label__0":0.039869263768196106}}
{"text":"MATH\n320 Number Systems, Statistics and Probability (5) Continuation of the\ndevelopment of the real numbers including applications and models of rational\nnumbers, irrational numbers, percent, and proportional reasoning. Introduction\nto the basic notions of chance and probability. Introduction to data analysis\nand statistics. This course involves substantial use of 2- and 3-dimensional\nconcrete materials in a cooperative learning setting. Prerequisites: A grade of\nC- or better in MATH 221. (4\nunits lecture and 1 unit activity).\n\nObjectives:\nMathematics 320 is the second of a sequence of three courses designed to help\nstudents gain the mathematical knowledge, skills, and understanding that are\nessential for those pursuing a Multiple Subject Credential as prescribed by the\nCalifornia Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Students will identify and\nprioritize relevant and missing information in mathematical problems. They will\nanalyze complex problems to identify similar simple problems that might suggest\nsolution strategies. They will explain their mathematical reasoning through a\nvariety of methods, such as words, numbers, symbols, charts, graphs, tables,\ndiagrams, and concrete models. They will use appropriate mathematical notation\nwith clear and accurate language. They will explain how to derive a result based\non previously developed ideas and explain how a result is related to other\nideas.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nfunctions with domain the rational numbers.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\ndecimals and operations on decimals.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nnonterminating decimals.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nreal numbers.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nratios, proportions and proportional reasoning.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\npercents.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nprobabilities.\n\nPerform experiments with tree\ndiagrams and geometric probabilities.\n\nUsing simulations in\nprobability.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nodds, conditional probability and expected value.\n\nDraw sensible conclusions from\ndisplayed data.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding of\nmeasures of central tendency and variation.\n\nDemonstrate an understanding\nwhen statistics is abused.\n\nNote:\nAlthough some attention will be given to how to teach mathematics effectively to\nchildren, this is a content course, not a methods course. Methodology is the\nprimary focus of the Credential Program.\n\nClass Meetings: MW: 10:50-12:30 pm,\nScience III 103.\n\nTh:\n10:30-12:30 pm, Science III 103.\n\nTextbook\n(required): Custom\nedition of A Problem Solving Approach to Mathematics for Elementary Teachers,\n10th ed, Part 1, by Billstein, Libeskind, and Lott, and a packet of labs\ntaken from Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers An Activity Approach,\nby Bennett, Burton, and Nelson. Sections of the text being covered in\nlecture should be read prior to coming to class. Lectures will not cover all\ntopics from each section, but students will be responsible for all topics in the\nsection.\n\nSupplies:\nIn addition to the textbook, each student must have a scientific calculator,\nseveral colored pencils, and 1/4-inch graph paper. These should be brought to\nclass with you each day.\n\nHomework:\nMathematics is not a spectator sport. You learn by doing. Although homework\nassignments will not be collected, it is assumed that you will do the homework\nnecessary for success in this class. We will spend considerable time at the\nbeginning of each lecture working out homework problems. Answers to most of the\nassigned problems are in the back of the book. If you are not able to solve a\nparticular problem, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates will be\ngrateful.\n\nReadings:\nThe student is responsible for reading at least twice each section of the book\ncovered in class: Before and after the lecture. The student will be told in\nadvance what sections of the book are to read. If you are not able to\nunderstand something in the book, do not hesitate to ask! Your classmates\nwill be grateful.\n\nQuizzes:\nThere will be seven\nquizzes, each of them administered most Thursdays at 10:35 pm; the student will\nbe able to drop the lowest score. Quizzes may not be made-up. If you miss a\nquiz you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any quizearly with the instructor's permission. Problems will be similar to those in\nthe homework or in the preceding activity. The primary purpose of these quizzesis to provide you with frequent evaluation of your content acquisition and\nto help you to reduce math anxiety. Quiz work is individual, see Note 2\nbelow.\n\nActivities:\nSeven activity\nassignments will be collected; the student will be able to drop the lowest\nscore. Activity attendance is required: Most Thursdays 10:50-12:30.\nThe student should work in groups of at least 3 people and 4 at most. During\nactivity sessions the student will work on an activity sheet and each member\nof his/her group should hand in a report at the beginning of next Thursday at\nthe latest. Activity work must be turned in on the activity pages from the\npacket. Late reports and reports from students absent from even one meeting\nwill not be accepted. A report should be neat and readable; solutions should\nfollow an increasing numerical sequence. Each member of a group will receive the\nsame number of points, so it is your responsibility to write down in each report\nonly the names of those who substantially contributed to the activity.\n\nExams:\nThere will be two Midterm exams and a cumulative final. Questions and problems\nwill deal with concepts discussed in lectures, homework, textbook, and\nactivities. Exchange of information, calculators, and supplies is absolutely\nprohibited during exams! To clarify a particular situation, the instructor\nreserves the right to a further examination, written or oral. Exam work is\nindividual, see Note 2 below. Midterm exams may not be made-up. If you miss\nan exam you will get a score of \"0\" (zero) recorded. You may take any exam\nearly with the instructor's permission.\n\nPartial\nCredit: Only substantial\ncontributions to the solution of a problem will count for partial credit. Mere\nrestating of a problem or the quoting of an incorrect fact, for example, will\nnot make you eligible for it. Students must watch out for logical mistakes, and\nmust make sure that all the hypotheses are met before recalling a particular\ntheorem.\n\nGrades:\nYour final grade is a function of the total of points awarded on the activities\nindicated above. Group homework is very helpful and greatly promoted in this\ncourse. However, it is necessary for college graduates to demonstrate individual\ncompetency on the subject. Therefore, regardless of your total of points, in\norder to get a D- or better in this course all of the following should be\nfulfilled at least:\n\n(a) To have scored at least\n200 points in the 2 Midterm exams combined.\n\n(b) To have scored at least\n105 points in the final exam.\n\nGenerally, the following guidelines\nfor grades apply:\n\n960 -1000 A\n900 - 959 A-\n\n870 - 899\nB+ 840 - 869 B 800 - 839 B-\n\n770 - 799\nC+ 740 - 769 C 700 - 739 C-\n\n670 - 699\nD+ 640 - 669 D 600 - 639 D-\n\n0- 599 F\n\nIf\nyou entered the liberal studies program on Fall 2011, you are required to get a\nC or better in all classes that you are taking for your major - this includes\nMath 320.\n\nNotes:\n\n1)\nIt is the student's responsibility\nto find out what (s)he missed if (s)he did not attend class. Office hours are\nnot meant for tutorial courses, but rather to clarify particular situations or\nproblems occurring during lectures, homework, labs, assignments or readings.\nStudents are encouraged to make use of the Office Hours.\n\n3)\nThe instructor will hold graded\npapers for one week at most. After this period, he will trash old papers.\nContact him as soon as you foresee a problem picking up your paper(s).\n\n4)\nAll handouts (with solutions) will\nbe in the internet (follow the link Math 320 in \n\n5)\nBeepers, cell phones, i-pods,\nlaptops and similar electronic devices must be turned off at all times during\nclass or lab time. If not, the student will have to leave the room without being\nallowed to return.\n\n6)\nStudents can be at most 10 minutes\nlate. Students cannot leave the room, unless it is for medical reasons.","id":"/158","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9705187678337097,"__label__0":0.02950129471719265}}

Math. Debrecen \"This is an unusual book, being more a book about mathematics than a mathematics book. It includes mathematical issues, but also questions from the philosophy of mathematics, the psychology of mathematical discovery, the history of mathematics, and biographies of mathematicians, in short, a book about the mathematical experience broadly considered… The book found its way into \"Much for liberal arts students\" courses and into education courses directed at future teachers. Term paper topics, essay assignments, problems, computer applications, and suggested readings are included. This new material should greatly enhance the usefulness of this very creative book. The range of topics covered is immense and the contents cannot easily be summarized. The book makes excellent casual reading, would make a good textbook, or could easily be used as a supplement to nearly any course concerned with mathematics.\" -Zentralblatt Math \"This is a people-centered book about mathematics, and as such it provides an opportunity to explore fundamental issues that are typically absent from the experience of most college and university students (as well as their teachers). This new edition provides an excellent initiation of students into some of the more challenging aspects of mathematics…The study edition of The Mathematical Experience will help its readers acquire a real understanding of mathematics.\" -Notices of the AMS \"Two distinguished mathematicians...have written a perfectly marvelous book about the Queen of Sciences, from which one will get a real feeling for what mathematicians do and who they are. The exposition is clear and full of wit and humor...\" --The New Yorker (1984 American Book Award Edition)\n\nBack in the early 90's when I was an almost-penniless mathematics student I was standing in front of a bookshelf in my local bookstore and had to choose between this and Gödel, Escher, Bach. I chose this book and I still don't regret it. [I have also subsequently bought GEB :-)] Driven by their obvious love of the subject, the authors do a credible job of tackling just what it is about mathematics that makes mathematicians love it so much, often to the bafflement of the rest of the world. A particular personal favourite is the series of four conversations between an \"ideal mathematician\" and, respectively, a University Public Information Officer, a philosophy student, a positive philosopher and a sceptical classicist. I would recommend this book to students of mathematics at any level beyond the elementary, especially those with an interest in the foundations of their subject. The authors do however acknowledge that some parts of the book will seem alien to the layman.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who enjoys Horizon and other science programs but wishes they were less stripped of technicalities and more in depth: if you are very curious about physics and mathematics, you may find this a very stimulating read. After all you don't need to be a good comedian to enjoy watching comedy, so with little mathematical knowledge you can enjoy this very wide ranging discussion of many exotic fields of maths and gain a sense of the range and significance and methodologies of this field at the outer limits of human abstract thought. This very readable, demanding, though provoking book that can occupy you for weeks and sustain several re-readings.\n\nAround my early to mid teens, finding the mathematics I was being taught easy but also puzzling I started to have philosophical questions that were just not properly addressed. I later hoped (naively I now know) my Science/Engineering degree would answer those questions. It didn't. I had wanted to dig deeper into what mathematics is but instead was taught increasingly obscure and complex \"results\" that were useful to my discipline. Had I known it at the time this book would have answered my questions (often answering them with more questions, true). It appears to give an excellent framework to the consideration of any uneasiness you might feel with mathematics especially if you find/found school levels maths easy.\n\nIf after reading this you still feel uneasy then you know you need to proceed further into philosophy.","id":"/176","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9048817753791809,"__label__0":0.09513825178146362}}

By working with professors from science, engineering, mathematics\nand computer science departments, the project aims to foster the creation of\ninterdisciplinary courses that demonstrate the interdependence of mathematics\nand science. For example, at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy , first semester students study the concept of change\nfrom both a discrete and a continuous point of view. At the end of the\nsemester students must model and solve particular problems by using a\ndiscrete dynamical system and by using a differential equation. Students then\ncompare and discuss the appropriateness and the results of the two\napproaches. Within the four-course core program, students at the United\nStates Military Academy also examine mathematical topics from the\nperspectives of linear versus nonlinear and stochastic versus deterministic.\nAt Carroll College, a 4-class core consisting of a total of 18 credit hours\ncovers many of the topics seen in the first two years of a traditional\ncurriculum, including differential and integral calculus, multivariable\ncalculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. The core also includes\ntopics not usually seen early, if at all: discrete dynamical systems, partial\ndifferential equations, probability, and statistics. Concepts\nare threaded together in and between classes to help students develop a\ndeeper understanding of how different branches of mathematics are\nintertwined. The website contains complete texts for over 40 modeling\nproblems developed at the United\nStatesMilitaryAcademy site.\n\nAlthough a number of the textbooks produced during the calculus reform\nmovement are no longer in print, both mainstream and reform texts now\nconsider the concepts of calculus from a variety of perspectives: not only\nthe symbolic, but also the graphical, numerical, and verbal.

Many\ncalculus texts now come with software to enhance student understanding from a\nvariety of perspectives.\n\nA good source of ideas on how to teach linear algebra from various\nperspectives is Resources\nfor Teaching Linear Algebra, edited by David Carlson, Charles R.\nJohnson, David Lay, Duane Porter, Ann Watkins, and William Watkins, MAA\nNotes vol. 42.\n\nThe concept of function can be regarded from many different perspectives\nand is important in all undergraduate mathematics courses.

For\ninstance, The\nHeart of Mathematics: An invitation to effective thinking by Edward\nB. Burger and Michael Starbird discusses the\nmathematics of bar codes, cryptography, geometry and art, fractals and chaos,\nand the likelihood of coincidences. A syllabus\nfor an interesting course that makes some use of this text is from Sarah\nGreenwald, Appalachian State University. Another text, Using\nand Understanding Mathematics by Jeffrey O. Bennett and William L.\nBriggs, University of Colorado at Boulder, contains sections on financial\nmanagement, modeling a variety of real-world situations, mathematics and art,\nmathematics and music, mathematics and politics, and mathematics and\nbusiness. See also the listings in this section under \"Introduce Contemporary\nTopics.\"\n\nIntroduce Contemporary Topics\n\nRobert Devaney, BostonUniversity, is a leader\nin promoting instruction in the contemporary topic of dynamical systems. In\naddition to his books and articles, talks, and professional development\ninstitutes, he has been director of the National Science Foundation's Dynamical Systems and Technology\nProject since 1989. The goal of this project is to show students and\nteachers how ideas from modern mathematics such as chaos, fractals, and\ndynamics, together with modern technology, can be used effectively in the\nhigh school and college curriculum.\n\nThe University of Maryland University College offers Mathematics\n– Contemporary Topics and Applications as both an in-class and\ndistance-learning first-year course. The course is a survey of contemporary\ntopics in mathematics, centering on applications and projects. Topics include\nmeasurements, rates of growth, basic statistics, the mathematics of political\npower, the geometry of the solar system, and computer arithmetic. The goals\nstate that after completing this course a student should be able to cite\nelements of good statistical design, undertake elementary statistical\nanalysis, and recognize and explain the shortcomings of unsound methods of\nstatistical analysis; mathematically analyze situations involving the\nweighting of power in various voting structures and implement apportionment\nof power strategies; and use the Pythagorean theorem and properties of\nsimilar triangles to calculate sizes of and distance between objects,\nincluding astronomical objects.\n\nStetsonUniversity offers a wide variety of\ncourses that meet the general mathematics requirement, including many\nthat discuss contemporary topics such as chaos and fractals, game theory, and\ncryptology.\n\nBoth of the popular texts For\nAll Practical Purposes, produced by the Consortium for Mathematics\nand Its Applications, and Excursions\nin Modern Mathematics by Peter Tannenbaum\nand Robert Arnold aim to convey insight about topics in contemporary\nmathematics and its applications to undergraduate students who have limited\nmathematical backgrounds. Topics in these books include the mathematics of\nvoting, fair division, and apportionment, applications of graph theory to\nmanagement science, fractal geometry, and statistics.\n\nAt Mount Holyoke College George Cobb teaches a course on the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method (MCMC), \"a very general and powerful method for\ncomputer simulation of situations that are too complicated to handle using\nmore conventional mathematical methods. MCMC has become a very active area of\nresearch at the interface of computer science and statistics, and has had a\npowerful impact on the practice of data analysis. As a method for computer\nsimulation, MCMC has very broad applicability. As a branch of mathematics,\nMCMC offers a number of compelling surprises – structures that on a concrete\nlevel seem quite different, but, viewed at the right level of abstraction, turn out to be different versions of the same\nidea.\"\n\nIn the article \"Geometric\nPhoto Manipulation\" Tom Farmer shows how calculus and linear algebra can\nbe used to manipulate photographs, a contemporary application with which many\nstudents have experience, thanks to currently available software.\n\nG.H. Hardy once proudly asserted that number theory\nwould never be applied. Yet today number theory has a range of important\napplications. Among these are cryptography (see, for example, lecture notes\nfrom two cryptography\ncourses by Ed Schaefer at Santa Clara University, the RSA website,\nand recent textbooks in number theory and discrete mathematics), and error\ndetection using check digits and error-correcting codes (see, for example, Numbers\nand symmetry: An Introduction to Algebraby\nBernard L. Johnston and Fred Richman and Contemporary\nAbstract Algebra by Joseph Gallian).\n\nEnhance Perception of Vitality and\nImportance of Mathematics\n\nThe World Wide Web provides a wealth of examples of the use and\napplicability of mathematics, but searching for appropriate illustrations can\nbe time consuming. There are several sites that focus on providing good\nexamples for instructors: Plus,\nan Internet magazine that aims to introduce readers to the beauty and the\npractical applications of mathematics; Mathematical Moments,\nan AMS program that offers a series of pdf files\nand podcasts to promote appreciation and\nunderstanding of the role mathematics plays in science, nature, technology,\nand human culture; and the Math Forum,\na center that provides resources, materials, activities, person-to-person\ninteractions, and educational products and services to enrich and support the\nteaching and learning of mathematics.\n\nChance\nNews is a monthly, on-line newsletter that provides abstracts of\narticles from current newspapers, the media, and journals, and suggests\ndiscussion questions for class use. It also includes links to related\nresources at other web sites. Since 1992, Chance News has been\nmaintained by J. Laurie Snell of DartmouthCollege. The\nexamples are current and can be used for student motivation, for class\ndiscussion, and as exercises in an introductory statistics course or\nprobability course.

{"text":"The skills that students are practicing in related rates problems are:\n\nDifferentiating a known equation implicitly with respect to time.\n\nInterpreting the time derivative of a quantity as a rate of change.\n\nThe main reason that related rates problems feel so contrived is that calculus books do not want to assume that the students are familiar with any of the equations of science or economics. Every related rates problem inherently involves differentiating a known equation, and the only equations that the calculus book assumes are the equations of geometry.\n\nThus, you can find related rates problems involving various area and volume formulas, related rates problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem or similar triangles, related rates problems involving triangle trigonometry, and so forth. A few of these problems are compelling -- for example, computing the speed of an airplane based on ground observations of its altitude and apparent angular velocity -- but most of them do feel a bit contrived.\n\nThe reality, of course, is that students are familiar with many of the basic equations and concepts of science and economics, and there's no rule against using these in problems. For example, you can make up all sorts of compelling related rates problems by starting with any physics or chemistry equation and imagining a situation where you might want to take its derivative:\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the object is accelerating at a rate of $9.8 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$, how fast is the kinetic energy increasing when the speed is $30 \\;\\text{m}/\\text{s}$?\n\nAn ideal gas satisfies $PV = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R \\approx 8.314\\;\\; \\text{J}\\; \\text{mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$. Give the rate at which the temperature and volume of the gas are increasing, and then ask about the rate of change in pressure when the volume and temperature reach certain amounts.\n\nThe total energy stored in a capacitor is $\\frac{1}{2} Q^2 / C$, where $Q$ is the amount of charge stored in the capacitor and $C$ is the capacitance. Give the value of $C$ and the rate at which $Q$ is decreasing, and ask about the rate at which the capacitor is losing energy when the energy is a certain amount.\n\nIn astronomy, the absolute magnitude $M$ of a star is related to its luminosity $L$ by the formula\n$$\nM \\;=\\; M_{\\text{sun}} -\\; 2.5\\; \\log_{10}(L/L_{\\text{sun}}).\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\text{sun}} = 4.75$ and $L_{\\text{sun}} = 3.839 \\times 10^{26} \\text{watts}$. (Note that, by convention, brighter stars have lower magnitude.) If the absolute magnitude of a variable star is decreasing at a rate of $0.09 / \\text{week}$, how quickly is the luminosity of the star increasing when the magnitude is $3.8$?\n\nIt's easy to make these up: just think of any equation in science or economics whose derivative might be interesting.

{"text":"Editorial Reviews\n\nAs far as math goes, McKellar knows her stuff. With two girlcentric, best-selling titles under her belt (Math Doesn't Suck, 2008, and Kiss My Math, 2009) and a degree in mathematics from UCLA, it is almost easy to forget that she was Winnie Cooper on The Wonder Years. Facing down a 432-page book devoted to algebra could give even math whizzes pause, but McKellar makes it work, taking the textbook-meets-Seventeen approach by mixing the explanations and equations with boy talk, quizzes, and testimonials from successful women. While a tutor might use this title as a teaching aid, teen girls will want to explore it on their own. Navigation is easy; students are encouraged to hop from chapter to chapter as their homework demands. The breakdown of equations is effective and certainly unconventional—explaining functions in terms of sausage factories, for example, or exponents in terms of whip-bearing female executives (makes sense in the book, promise)—and while McKellar keeps her focus on how to solve math problems, her approach is both readable and even entertaining. --Courtney Jones\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBestMore About the Author\n\nBest known for her roles on The Wonder Years and The West Wing, Danica McKellar graduated summa cum laude in mathematics from UCLA, went on to co-write a published math theorem, and continues to be an outspoken role model for young women to excel in math.\n\nMcKellar's 3rd and latest math book encourages teenage girls to outclass the boys in algebra. This can be an especially tough subject and she tackles it in a way that invites the outlandish idea of actually enjoying math.\n\nShe rejects the notion that excelling in algebra is all about natural gift. Rather, it's about determination and making an effort.\n\nWhile the sex-appeal of the book might be in question, ultimately this is a book broken down into straightforward language, easy charts and memorable reminders of the process of algebra.\n\nAdditionally, you'll find motivating stories from youthful female adults who've struggled with math, but learned to conquer their struggles. Danica proclaims. \"I'm here to tell you that giving up on ourselves because of our own stereotypes and limited imaginations is a far more destructive force than any challenge or obstacle 'out there,'\"\n\nOne bonus in the book is the inclusion of good tables and charts. These can be worth the price of the book alone. These succinctly explain the meaning of math terms such as fractions, coefficients and variables.\n\nA surprising aspect of the book is the authors inclusion of advice on how to choose the right guys to date. While she doesn't provide a mathematic formula for this it does seem she dispenses some basic common sense.\n\nWhat a great book to help tutor teen girls in math! It is organized well, so it is easy to navigate and you don't have to read it straight through. You can pick your topic and go back and forth with ease. The author is obviously a great teacher and knows her stuff. She combines that with her ability to reach out and grab the attention of teen girls and make math fun. A must have to share with the girls in your life!\n\nAt last, a book that teaches middle-school students and their parents in simple terms how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square and to solve the quadratic equation in standard form in X (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) to come up with the quadratic forumla. Most colleges and high schools do not teach this -- they just expect the student to know it.\n\nThe charter school I support plans to use Hot X: Algebra Exposed in concert with the first two books to ensure most or all Grade 8 students attain an A (93 or higher) in Algebra I.\n\nDanica McKellar needs to continue writing math books. Since these are such outstanding books, few state departments of education will adopt them for use, which means parents, other major care givers, and supportive businesses will have to come up with the funds to help schools with the purchase of these books. Not only should the schools have these books for use as textbooks, but individual students should have their own copy to help learn the material initially and to refresh key points as they complete Algebra II and beyond.\n\nDanica also has web sites that provide additional information for each book.

{"text":"So I was having a lot of medical issues my freshman year, and I pulled a C+ in second quarter calculus and a C- in third quarter calculus (integration and multivariable calculus, respectively.) I still have one more quarter of calculus entitled \"Vector analysis.\" I'm wondering if my poor performance (and poor understanding of the material) is going to negatively affect me later on. Will I have a chance to relearn some of the material in my other classes, or should I self study to get myself up to par? Just so you know, as of right now I'm leaning towards a Mechanical Engineering major, but I may switch into Civil (though highly unlikely.) This upcoming quarter I'm taking Vector Analysis, first quarter Calculus-based Physics, and a MATLAB course (I have absolutely zero programming experience.) Physics and MATLAB both require integral calculus as a prerequisite. I need a B in physics to switch into MechE. Should I be self studying the calculus that I don't quite understand?\n\nAlso, will these grades kill my chances of getting into grad school? They're my only grades below a B, and I hopefully won't have many (any?) more C's in my college career.\n\nTo understand the computational part of engineering you need to understand differential equations, which is where you use the calculus skills. You then use DEs to describe all kinds of physical phenomena. So, the basic calculus skills are very important to understanding engineering.\n\nThanks HPuck. So would it suffice to get down integration and partial derivatives and their applications? Or should I learn other things like Taylor Polynomials and Convergence/Divergence (the stuff that tripped me up most)?\n\nCalculus is one of the few subjects you really need to put in the effort to learn well. Study all of it until you have a strong conceptual understanding of it. Bad grades are bad grades, but calculus is important.\n\nCalculus will be used in physics. Multivariable calculus will become important when you take the physics course with electricity and magnetism. Differential equations will become important in many places.\n\nTry and improve on basic integration/misc techniques (integration by parts, partial fraction decomp, trig int, partial derivations, etc) because these will be very important in DE. A lot of questions will have a lot of nested integrals/nasty integrals and you don't want to get stuck in the middle of the question. Freshen up on Taylor and Maclaurin series. When you take linear alg practice matrix techniques, translation matrices, etc. (will be used in systems of differential equations)There are only two subjects you absolutely have to know, without constantly consulting a reference: calculus and physics.\nYeah, it will come back to haunt you if you don't put in the effort to get the hang of it. Get on that, no matter how much work it takes.1 year left of Engineering school. Taylor series rarely comes into play. The only time it did show up, it was just mentioned as part of the proof and we didn't have to do anything with it. But yes, calculus is EXTREMELY important, if not for the pure concept of what it means to take the integral/derivative. Also, so so many people don't have a good grasp on all the material that came before calculus too, especially trig. Know your trig, it will help you out, a lot.","id":"/195","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9775382876396179,"__label__0":0.022481704130768776}}
{"text":"Specification\n\nAims\n\nThe unit aims to introduce the basic ideas of differentiable manifolds.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nDifferentiable manifolds are among the most fundamental notions of modern mathematics. Roughly, they are geometrical objects\nthat can be endowed with coordinates; using these coordinates one can apply differential and integral calculus, but the results\nare coordinate-independent.\n\nExamples of manifolds start with open domains in Euclidean space R^n , and include \"multidimensional surfaces\"\nsuch as the n-sphere S^n and n-torus T^n , the projective spaces RP^n and\nCP^n , and their generalizations, matrix groups such as the rotation group SO(n), etc. Differentiable\nmanifolds naturally appear in various applications, e.g., as configuration spaces in mechanics. They are arguably the most general objects\non which calculus can be developed. On the other hand, differentiable manifolds provide for calculus a powerful invariant geometric language,\nwhich is used in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications.\n\nIn this course we give an introduction to the theory of manifolds, including their definition and examples; vector fields and differential\nforms; integration on manifolds and de Rham cohomology.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn completion of this unit successful students will be able to:\n\ndeal with various examples of differentiable manifolds and smooth maps;\n\nhave familiarity with tangent vectors, tensors and differential forms;\n\nwork practically with vector fields and differential forms;\n\nappreciate the basic ideas of de Rham cohomology and its examples;\n\napply the ideas of differentiable manifolds to other areas.\n\nFuture topics requiring this course unit\n\nDifferentiable manifolds are used in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications, including physics and engineering.\nThe following course units are specifically based on MATH31061/MATH41061 Differentiable Manifolds:\nMATH41122 Differential Geometry; MATH41101 Geometric Cobordism Theory\n\nSyllabus\n\nManifolds and smooth maps. Coordinates on familiar spaces. Charts and atlases. Definitions of manifolds and smooth maps.\nProducts. Specifying manifolds by equations. More examples of manifolds.\n\nIntegration. Orientation. Integral over a compact oriented manifold. Independence of atlas and partition of unity. Integration over singular manifolds and chains. Stokes theorem.\n\nDe Rham cohomology. Definition of cohomology and examples of nonzero classes. Poincaré Lemma. Examples of calculation.\n\nTextbooks\n\nNo particular textbook is followed. Students are advised to keep their own lecture notes. There are many good sources available\ntreating various aspects of differentiable manifolds on various levels and from different viewpoints.

{"text":"will provide activists with self-standing lessons and online support so they can apply and share mathematical thinking to address globalization and its consequences, notably climate change.\n\nWe will create a set of 30 self-standing math lessons for self-learners . Each lesson will present a classic math problem and a deep idea which it illustrates. We will organize an online support center for tutoring and consulting, but especially for supporting \"math in action\" for analysis and communication of challenges and solutions in our changing world, focusing on climate change. We will publish a paperback, worksheets, a wiki and YouTube videos, all in the Public Domain.\n\nOur age of globalization is propagating rapid changes and dramatic instabilities. Will we match this with an ability to think and talk and act decisively and independently? We need to appreciate the connection between our local choices and the global picture. Mathematics is a language for talking about the subtle but profound distinctions of the models that may be at play. It helps us care about each other's situation around the world. We're all potential climate refugees. Math help us learn to share with each other. It helps us exchange our wisdom as climate patterns shift and disrupt our agriculture, our water supply, our built environment. We need to think deeply and learn rapidly. We need ideas and problems that are to the point and can be spread freely. We need math lessons on-demand!\n\nAndrius Kulikauskas is since childhood a lifelong learner on a quest to know everything and apply that knowledge usefully. At the University of California at San Diego, he studied mathematics as a tool for conceptual thinking. He was appointed senior teaching assistant, responsible for training the first year teaching assistants. He earned his Ph.D. in 1993 for this thesis \"Symmetric Functions of the Eigenvalues of a Matrix\".\n\nAndrius taught a Precalculus class at UCSD for students who were ill prepared for Calculus. He knew the dismal state of mathematics teaching. High school teachers generally don't think mathematically. Truly, mathematics should be a tool for thinking, where the point is first to understand the relevance of various models, and only then to calculate. Unfortunately, textbooks are full of contrived, irrelevant problems which hinder mathematical intuition. Andrius taught from his own notes:  He identified the key ideas leading up to Calculus, and surveyed them all in thirty one-hour lessons. His students did very well!\n\nIn 2008, Andrius taught algebra as a Professor at American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He taught 90 business students, many of whom were unmotivated because they thought math was irrelevant, and yet they rated him an outstanding teacher. He concentrated on teaching them a few dozen classic problems which were difficult but insightful. For example, suppose that the price of a barrel of oil goes up by one-third this week, but then goes down by one-third next week. What is the overall change in price? Many people suppose that the two changes cancel out and the price is the same. But actually, if the barrel of oil costs $90, then it goes up to $120, but down to $80! And, in general, it goes up from X to 4/3 X and then down to 8/9 X. This is a very thoughtful problem and it illustrates a very deep idea, which is that algebra is the study of thinking step-by-step. If you don't think step-by-step, you can't solve this problem, because you won't know what \"one-third\" means. Most books and teachers don't and can't teach step-by-step thinking because it's a lot of work to grade. But if the problem is truly relevant, then the effort is worth it!\n\nHere are some of Andrius's favorite problems:\n\n* The world's population is doubling every thirty years. Suppose that was always true. When was Adam created? and Eve? It may be shocking to learn that they appeared only 1,000 years ago! This shows the power of exponential growth, but especially, is a great illustration of how a model (and perhaps every model) breaks down at a certain point.\n* What is 10 + 4? The answer is 2! At least the clock says it is! Ten o'clock plus four o'clock is two o'clock. This problem shows that there is more than one mathematical system, but also suggests that we can't write down everything we need to know about a system.\n* All parabolas have the same shape! Some may look skinny and others fat. Yet by zooming in and out, flipping them upside down, moving left or right or up or down, we can see that they have the same shape. This teaches us the basics of transforming any graph.\n* \"A right triangle is half a rectangle\". Thus the shape of a right triangle is given by the ratio of the two sides of the rectangle. But you also know the shape if you know one of the right triangle's acute angles. We can switch back and forth between these two ways of looking at the shape. This \"bijection\" is the basis for trigonometry!\n* \"Four times a right triangle is the difference of two squares.\" This geometric fact makes for a quick proof of the Pythagorean theorem, but also shows the theorem's relevance for switching coordinate systems, which is to say, points of view.\n\nImagine if all of math education was organized around such classic problems. Andrius will write an essay for every such problem to show why and how it's interesting for a mathematician and philosopher. Each lesson can include many variants of the problem along with applications and exercises. A few dozen problems are enough to survey all of algebra. They could fit in a paperback of 150 pages or so.\n\nSuch a paperback would allow parents to master the mathematics which they'd like to help their children learn. After reading such a paperback, they would feel confident taming the monstrous 500 page textbooks used at school.\n\nImagine if people could use such materials without restriction! Ours will be in the Public Domain so they might be shared, adapted and improved! A teacher in Africa might print out one lesson at a time, think up a game that teaches the concept, and then write a letter how it went. People could share examples and applications from around the world!\n\nIndeed, we can set up a wiki to collect classic problems, ideas and examples in math and other subjects. A wiki is an online tool with which individual problems could be easily edited and linked together into a pattern language, as in Christopher Alexander's \"A Timeless Way of Building\". Yet each lesson can also stand on its own.\n\nWe're living in a world with many new issues linking people of very different cultures. We need to be able to understand subtle but profound implications of our decisions. Activists need math to analyze and communicate the choices we have. We can support them online with a chat room and related venues. We can help them find the right lesson to apply to their challenge and to teach the public and the powers-that-be. They can present their lesson with a short video of \"math in action\".\n\nWe have many opportunities to apply math in our world. We can develop math intuition based on real problems, not contrived exercises. We can organize an online community to create learning materials in the Public Domain that encourage self-learners to understand mathematics in terms of its deep ideas and practical applications. As we face global challenges, including our current economic crisis, we find social and business opportunity in recognizing what is truly worth learning, and making that available for all to share freely. We offer a Baltic and Nordic team to start up this activist approach to education.\n\nAndrius will start by identifying noteworthy math problems from his own notes, from websites, from discussion groups, from colleagues online and from mathematics textbooks, especially intuitive books such as \"Applying Arithmetic: A Handbook of Applications of Arithmetic\" by Zalman Usiskin and Max Bell and \"How to Lie with Statistics\" by Darrell Huff. He will continuously look for new problems and invite others to contribute them. He will relate each problem with a deep idea that it illustrates. He will select what he thinks are the thirty or so pairs of problems and ideas which most completely and profoundly present mathematics. He will write an essay for each problem/idea.\n\nAndrius will also create a general format for writing up each problem, idea and related examples, illustrations, applications and exercises. He will adapt the wiki at worknets.org with templates and navigation which accomodate the contributing, polishing and organizing of these problems for self-learners.\n\nEarly in our project, Andrius will travel to Tampere, Finland to work for one month with filmmaker Teemu Takatalo at the Hirvitalo community centre. Andrius will work with activists to understand what math ideas might be relevant for their campaigns. Teemu will coach them on using video to communicate these ideas.\n\nAndrius will also travel to Latvia to work with open source publisher Didzis Veinbergs. Didzis will find one or more designers and/or illustrators to help with designing the website and illustrating the mathematical ideas. They will also provide images for our video makers in Finland.\n\nMihkel Pilv and Miksike will find adults who are interested in learning mathematics, perhaps in order to help their children learn. Andrius will visit them in Estonia for one month and tutor them. He will also organize online tutoring at  by chat, email and Skype to help them and others around the world.\n\nMidway into our project, Andrius will start publishing individual lessons online. Miksike's adult learners will test the lessons and help create related worksheets. Andrius will return to work with them.\n\nAs the videos are completed, they will be published online and also made available through our wiki. Didzis Veinbergs will promote them and the activist's campaigns along with the upcoming book. Andrius Kulikauskas will visit him in Latvia and they will publish and promote a short paperback of \"Classic Math Problems\".\n\nWe will adapt the book and translate it from English into Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian and publish and promote electronic versions.\n\nAll of the materials created for our project will belong to the Public Domain.\n\nDescription of partnership(\"who does what\")\n\nOur project includes four partners from Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Finland.\n\nMinciu Sodas is the coordinator for our project. It is a sole proprietorship registered in Vilnius, Lithuania. Andrius Kulikauskas is the founder, sole proprietor and Direktorius. Minciu Sodas is an online laboratory for serving and organizing independent thinkers around the world. We have about 150 active and 1,500 supportive participants. Our most spectacular project so far was the Pyramid of Peace  in 2008 in Kenya. We organized 100 peacemakers on-the-ground and 100 online assistants to avert genocide during the post-election turmoil. We used our wiki, mailing lists and chat room, all in the Public Domain, to coordinate our work.\n\nAndrius Kulikauskas will select the problems and ideas, author the essays, the lessons and the paperback, and code the wiki and help room. This work is the heart of this project. He will be supported by Minciu Sodas's team of online assistants who will collect interesting examples and tutor self-learners.\n\nMiksike is a pioneer in educational crowdsourcing.  More than 1,000 volunteers have created 30,000 worksheets used by 120,000 students, see: lefo.net Miksike is a Private Limited Company based in Estonia. Mihkel Pilv is the director. He is an innovative entrepreneur, ever discovering new business opportunity. Mihkel and Andrius met on a flight to the MIT Media Lab ThinkCycle's Development by Design 2002 conference in Bangalore, India to which they both won travel awards for their papers about their work.\n\nPispalan kulttuuriyhdistys ry (Pispala Cultural Association) runs the Hirvitalo center of contemporary art in Tampere, Finland. Hirvitalo is a base for artistic and cultural activists, including gardens and permaculture. Markus Petz is now the European Voluntary Service coordinator there. He first met Andrius on a road trip they took together to visit UK independent thinkers. Markus organized a video bridge from Hirvitalo in 2008 with Andrius about his paper \"An Economy for Giving Everything Away\".\n\nPispala Cultural Association will organize ten activists addressing the consequences of globalization, especially climate change. Each activist will create a YouTube video illustrating \"math in action\" in their campaigns. Teemu Takatalo will coach them in video skills.\n\nŪdenszīmes (Signs of Water) is an NGO from Jēkabpils, Latvia, that is working towards improving the possibilities of education for children and young people in Latvia, thus helping create an educated, ethical and responsible society. It was founded in 2007, and its founding members have been active in other NGOs since 1997. Ūdenszīmes will host Didzis Veinbergs's work to publish our Classic Math Problems as a paperback in the Public Domain. Didzis and Andrius met in 2008 at BarCamp Baltics. Andrius invited Didzis to Vilnius for the workshop \"Ethical Public Domain: Debate of Questionable Practices\" which Minciu Sodas organized for COMMUNIA, the European Union's thematic network for the Public Domain. Didzis spoke there about his plan to publish books with free licences. Didzis will publish, promote and distribute Andrius's book as well as provide designers and/or illustrators for related websites.\n\nMinciu Sodas will translate the book into Lithuanian, Ūdenszīmes into Latvian and Miksike into Estonian.\n\nOf our total budget of 82,000 EUR, which includes our co-financing and our administrative fee, we ask for 60,000 EUR of which 30,000 EUR is for Minciu Sodas, 10,000 EUR for Miksike, 10,000 EUR for Pispala Cultural Association and 10,000 EUR for Ūdenszīmes.\n\nEach of the partners will contribute co-financing in terms of the work of their many volunteers who will collect examples and staff our help room and translate into Lithuanian (Minciu Sodas), try out our lessons and create worksheets (Miksike), apply our math lessons to climate change and other global challenges (Pispala Cultural Association) and promote and distribute our book (Ūdenszīmes).\n\nExpected outcome(Please describe the expected results of your project, who will be effected and how, directly and/or indirectly)\n\nOur project will result in a wealth of learning materials in the Public Domain.\n\nWe will publish a short, readable, popular book \"Classic Math Problems\" with essays on about 30 math problems and the deep ideas they illustrate, along with applications and exercises, and an introduction that weaves them all together. There is a chance that our book will become a classic. \"How to Lie With Statistics\" was first published in 1954 and today ranks in the top 7,000 books at Amazon.com\n\nWe will organize a thriving where such problems are suggested and polished by completing a template for them. Our wiki will link together the problems by various threads. We will establish a new paradigm for creating learning materials.\n\nWe will also include links to 10 videos that show our \"math in action\". We will have helped 10 activists use math to make their case to the public and relevant institutions. We aim for at least one of them to achieve a success that affects or inspires at least 100,000 people.\n\nWe will jumpstart an online help room  In our first year we will personally help more than 100 people develop their mathematical thinking.\n\nWe will create worksheets for use through Miksike and other venues. In particular, we will create one-page worksheets, each dedicated to one lesson, so that a teacher can print them out on-demand when they prepare for their class.\n\nWe will publish CDs and/or USB flash drives with all of the above materials for use in remote areas such as Africa with computers such as the One Laptop Per Child XO.\n\nOur materials will be primarily in English, but also some lessons and worksheets in Estonian and possibly other languages.\n\nAll of the content which we create for this project will be in the Public Domain.\n\nWe will have a team of enthusiasts in the Nordic and Baltic countries and around the world interested in further developing learning materials for mathematics but also other subjects.\n\nDissemination of results(Please focus on sharing the results with individuals, organisations or groups who are not your partners this project)\n\nWe will have electronic versions of the book and associated learning materials in English, Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian.\n\nWe will print at least 1500 copies of the English version of our book. We will sell at least 1,000 copies in stores in the Nordic and Baltic countries and also by mail.\n\nWe will distribute our printed book to at least 500 people around the world who will help promote the printed and/or online versions, bring attention to them and open up business opportunity. We're especially interested in parents, especially homeschoolers, who would like to learn math better so they could teach their children, and also activists who might benefit from applying mathematics and thereby raise public interest in our classic math problems. We expect at least 7,000 people to read or hear lessons from the printed book and that a second printing be profitable.\n\nIn the first year that the book is available, we expect at least 10,000 people in the Nordic and Baltic region to download the electronic book in English, Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian. We expect 100,000 people around the world to download the English version and another 100,000 people to learn from it through the One Laptop Per Child program with which we have links through Edward Cherlin's Earth Treasury, a working group of Minciu Sodas.\n\nWe hope to attract media attention to our activists's campaigns in Finland and encourage other activists in the Nordic and Baltic countries to make use of our math lessons.\n\nIn Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and other Mikiske Learning Folder countries, we would like our math lessons to be a key resource for Miksike's large community of teachers and students.\n\nWe expect that Earth Treasury initiative  will organize the creation of open source educational software and animations based on lessons in our book.\n\nWe expect our wiki to be a growing repository of math lessons and our chat room helproom.org to be the center of lively tutoring and consulting services, for free and for pay, in math and other areas.\n\nMinciu Sodas has many contacts in Africa. We're very excited that they might use and share our math learning materials.\n\nIn all of our efforts, our materials will spread more easily and widely because they are in the Public Domain for all to freely share, adapt and improve.\n\nHow will you evaluate that your project has met its objectives\n\nWe evaluate our project in terms of the relationships which we create, especially the people we include.\n\nWe expect, at the end of our project, to have a thriving wiki system with a well structured template, a core team of contributors and a growing collection of lessons and applications in math but also other fields.\n\nWe wish to find an eager market for our book so that we can fund a second printing of our own resources. We will note any interest that our book be translated, republished by others, and printed on-demand.\n\nWe will be excited to see individual lessons being copied and circulated. We will note the most popular sites for getting our book and note the download statistics.\n\nWe will be delighted if our materials are used by teachers and there are students learning math without standard textbooks, but especially in poor countries, such as in Africa.\n\nWe would like to see one or more of our lessons receive attention in the press thanks to its significance for some activist campaign. We would like one or more of our videos to be popular at YouTube. We will make up for each lesson a \"tag\" (like \"halfrectangle\") which can be used on YouTube, Flickr and other sites to note the uses of our classic math problems that all are encouraged to share. We would be excited to see people using such a tag system.\n\nWe plan for an active online help room with regular tutoring activity and potential business opportunity.\n\nWe wish to encourage a growing number of people that math's deep ideas and classic problems are truly relevant for thinkers and activists, especially for global issues such as climate change. We will know that we are having an impact on globalization and climate change if our lessons are adapted locally.","id":"/199","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9309057593345642,"__label__0":0.06911420822143555}}

{"text":"Algebra I\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION\n\nAlgebra I is one of the most critical courses that students take in high school. Not only does it introduce them to a powerful reasoning tool with applications in many different careers, but algebra is the gateway to higher education. Students who do well in algebra are\n\nbetter prepared for college entrance exams and for college in general, since algebra teaches them how to solve problems and think abstractly—skills that pay off no matter what major they pursue.\n\nBecause algebra involves a new way of thinking, many students find it especially challenging. Many parents also find it to be the area where they have the most trouble helping their high-school-age children. With 36 half-hour lessons, Algebra I is an entirely new course developed to meet both these concerns, teaching students and parents the concepts and procedures of first-year algebra in an easily accessible way. Indeed, anyone wanting to learn algebra from the beginning or needing a thorough review will find this course an ideal tutor.\n\nConquer the Challenges of Learning Algebra\n\nTaught by Professor James A. Sellers, an award-winning educator at The Pennsylvania State University, Algebra I incorporates the following valuable features:\n\nDrawing on extensive research, The Great Courses and Dr. Sellers have identified the biggest challenges for high school students in mastering Algebra I, which are specifically addressed in this course.\n\nThis course reflects the latest standards and emphases in high school and college algebra taught in the United States.\n\nAlgebra I includes a mini-textbook with detailed summaries of each lesson, a multitude of additional problems to supplement those presented in the on-screen lessons, guided instructions for solving the problems, and important formulas and definitions of terms.\n\nProfessor Sellers interacts with viewers in a one-on-one manner, carefully explaining every step in the solution to a problem and giving frequent tips, problem-solving strategies, and insights into areas where students have the most trouble.\n\nAs Director of Undergraduate Mathematics at Penn State, Professor Sellers appreciates the key role that algebra plays in preparing students for higher education. He understands what entering college students need to have mastered in terms of math preparation to launch themselves successfully on their undergraduate careers, whether they intend to take more math in college or not. Professor Sellers is alert to the math deficiencies of the typical entering high school graduate, and he has developed an effective strategy for putting students confidently on the road to college-level mathematics.\n\nWhatever your age, it is well worth the trouble to master this subject. Algebra is indispensible for those embarking on careers in science, engineering, information technology, and higher mathematics, but it is also a fundamental reasoning tool that shows up in economics, architecture, publishing, graphic arts, public policy, manufacturing, insurance, and many other fields, as well as in a host of at-home activities such as planning a budget, altering a recipe, calculating car mileage, painting a room, planting a garden, building a patio, or comparison shopping.\n\nAnd for all of its reputation as a grueling rite of passage, algebra is actually an enjoyable and fascinating subject—when taught well.\n\nAlgebra without Fear\n\nProfessor Sellers takes the fear out of learning algebra by approaching it in a friendly and reassuring spirit. Most students won't have a teacher as unhurried and as attentive to detail as Dr. Sellers, who explains everything clearly and, whenever possible, in more than one way so that the most important concepts sink in.\n\nHe starts with a review of fractions, decimals, percents, positive and negative numbers, and numbers raised to various powers, showing how to perform different operations on these values. Then he introduces variables as the building blocks of algebraic expressions, before moving on to the main ideas, terms, techniques, pitfalls, formulas, and strategies for success in tackling Algebra I. Throughout, he presents a carefully crafted series of gradually more challenging problems, building the student's confidence and mastery.\n\nAfter taking this course, students will be familiar with the terminology and symbolic nature of first-year algebra and will understand how to represent various types of functions (linear, quadratic, rational, and radical) using algebraic rules, tables of data, and graphs. In the process, they will also become acquainted with the types of problems that can be solved using such functions, with a particular eye toward solving various types of equations and inequalities.\n\nThroughout the course, Professor Sellers emphasizes the following skills:\n\nUsing multiple techniques to solve problems\n\nUnderstanding when a given technique can be used\n\nKnowing how to translate word problems into mathematical expressions\n\nRecognizing numerical patterns\n\nTips for Success\n\nAlgebra is a rich and complex subject, in which seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome, often with ease, if one knows how to approach them. Professor Sellers is an experienced guide in this terrain and a treasure trove of practical advice—from the simple (make sure that you master the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to the more demanding (memorize the algebraic formulas that you use most often). Here are some other examples of his tips for success:\n\nLearn the order of operations: These are the rules you follow when performing mathematical operations. You can remember the order with this sentence: Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. The first letter of each word stands for an operation. First, do all work in parentheses; then the exponents; then multiplication and division; finally, do the addition and subtraction.\n\nKnow your variables: It's easy to make a mistake when writing an algebraic expression if you don't understand what each variable represents. Choose letters that you can remember; for example, d for distance and t for time. If you have sloppy handwriting, avoid letters that look like numbers (b, l, o, s, and z).\n\nUse graph paper: You'll be surprised at how the grid of lines encourages you to organize your thinking. The columns and rows help you keep your work neat and easy to follow.\n\nPay attention to signs: Be very careful of positive and negative signs. A misplaced plus or minus sign will give you the wrong answer.\n\nDon't mix units: If you are using seconds and are given a time in minutes, make sure to convert the units so they are all the same.\n\nSimplify: Straighten out the clutter in an equation by putting like terms together. Constants, such as 7, -2, 28, group together, as do terms with the same variable, such as 3x, x, -10x. Then combine the like terms. Often you'll find that the equation practically solves itself.\n\nBalance the equation: When you perform an operation on one side of an equation—such as adding or subtracting a number, or multiplying or dividing the entire side by a quantity—do the exact same thing to the other side. This keeps things in balance.\n\nAbove all, check your work! When you have finished a problem, ask yourself, \"Does this answer make sense?\" Plug your solution into the original equation to see if it does. Checking your work is the number one insurance policy for accurate work—the step that separates good students from superstar students.\n\nBy developing habits such as these, you will discover that solving algebra problems becomes a pleasure and not a chore—just as in a sport in which you have mastered the rudiments and are ready to face a competitor. Algebra I gives you the inspirational instruction, repetition, and practice to excel at what for many students is the most dreaded course in high school. Open yourself to the world of opportunity that algebra offers by making the best possible start on this all-important subject.\n\nLECTURES\n\n36Lectures\n\nProfessor Sellers introduces the general topics and themes for the course, describing his approach and recommending a strategy for making the best use of the lessons and supplementary workbook. Warm up with some simple problems that demonstrate signed numbers and operations.\nContinue your study of math fundamentals by exploring various procedures for converting between percents, decimals, and fractions. Professor Sellers notes that it helps to see these procedures as ways of presenting the same information in different forms.\nContinuing your exploration of rational expressions, try your hand at multiplying and dividing them. The key to solving these complicated-looking equations is to proceed one step at a time. Close the lesson with a problem that brings together all you've learned about rational functions.\n\nExamine the distinctive graphs formed by rational functions, which may form vertical or horizontal curves that aren't even connected on a graph. Learn to identify the intercepts and the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of these fascinating curves.\nPattern recognition is an important and fascinating mathematical skill.

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of algebraic concepts. Students will begin to explore patterns, relations, and functions. They will learn to represent and analyze mathematical situations using algebraic symbols and graphing in preparation for high school. The course will emphasize problem-solving strategies and incorporate applications to real world situations while aiding students in becoming 21st century learners.\n\nThis year we will be utilizing the \"Flipped Classroom\" concept. Students will watch instructional videos at home at their own pace. Class time will be spent communicating with peers and the teacher in discussions about the video, completing practice problems related to the topic, and doing interactive activities to illustrate the concept. For more information regarding the \"Flipped Classroom,\" see \"What is the Flipped Classroom?\" in the document section to the right.\n\nFor valuable information regarding algebra class, assignments, or to see what we have coming up in class, please view the content below or the links listed in the \"classroom pages\" section to the right.","id":"/203","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9116305112838745,"__label__0":0.08838944137096405}}
{"text":"Excellent resource for the class! I like your style and I'm interested in your products and store! I'm your new follower! You can visit my store and leave a comment if you wish! hugs and Happy Easter! Hernan\n\nThis lesson is the introduction to a unit on Functions for Algebra 2 Honors students. The lesson is taught at the beginning of the school year when students may not be quite prepared for the rigor of Algebra 2 Honors. It is just a general review of the basic vocabulary that will be needed throughout the unit. While we may think the lesson is touching only at the surface, students continue to struggle throughout the school year with domain, range, and function notation.\nIt is interesting to discuss the ideas of continous domains and discrete domains for Example #3 and the idea that function notation indicates the coordinate. Both of these ideas are introduced to students in this textbook here and the understanding continues to grow through the next two courses. I would be glad to send you another lesson for your dissatisfaction. Contact me at jean.adams@ocps.net\n\nno, you can teach the lesson by just placing the Foldable under a document camera. I use a wireless slate and the smart notebook software. This way I can use the lesson repeatedly and write on the smart lesson fresh each class. I believe there are other ways that smart software can display. possibly with an iPad and splashtop software. you might ask a tech person in your school.\n\nMay 21, 2013\n\nJulie Larsen re: ALG 2 UNIT: Sequences and Series FOLDABLES ONLY\n\nThe quality of the notes is great. My big question is...how do I tell which is page 1, 2, 3, etc. It seems essential in order to copy the pages correctly to make the foldable. I can figure some out based on the example numbers, however, is the Arithmetic Sequences with the vocab page 1, 2, etc. What page number is the Arithmetic sequences with the formulas?\n\nThe foldable was created in order. If your printer copies on two sides, you can choose to flip them on the short side and they copy double sided in the correct order. The vocabulary is always the first or front page and the side with the blank sheet on the third page of the document will be the last sheet or page 8 on the foldable. My students glue this blank page into their composition books to save them in order of their textbook lessons. In this particular lesson, the formulas appear on the 5th page of the foldable. If you need more assistance, you can email me at jean@j-adams.com\n\nYou might think this is a crazy question, but I am trying to figure out something. On problem B, which has 2Z + B = ____, if you only have say 6 brown or Z M&M's, how are you showing the 2 times Z with the M&M's? My husband and myself are both math teachers and we are trying to use this lesson as a dynamic lesson in an 8th grade math classroom. We love the idea. Thank you! my email is acawood@roaneschools.com or avols845@hotmail.com\n\nAmy, If I understand your question correctly, I think you mean since Z=Brown M&M's and B=Blue M&M's if you have 6 brown the question in the B prompt has two equations 2Z + B = ___ and Z-B = ____.\nStudents would write 2Z + B = 6 and Z-B=6.\nNow, say that the students bag had only 3 blue M&M's, and had 6 brown M&M's. Their system would now read2Z+B=9 and Z-B=3. When students use substitution method or elimination method, they will get Z=6 and B=3 for the answer if their algebra is correct. Hope this helps.\n\nYes, each lesson has a full answer key. Whether you purchase the single lesson or the set of handouts only or Smartboard Lessons only, each has the answer key provided.\n\nApril 7, 2013\n\nmhilvert\n\nI recently bought the Families of Functions Foldable book and am having a hard time figuring out how to put it together correctly. Do you have any suggestions? Everytime I put it together the 'summary of transformations' page is between #5/6 and #7/8?\nThanks\n\nI have uploaded a more detailed assembly directions for you which shows the layout for printing. You can see this free document at Foldable Assembly Directions.\nIf you still have trouble, please let me know. Thanks.\n\nMy colleague and I bought this unit but we are having a hard time with the foldables. I've created this type of booklet before. I tried to create yours several times but the pages are all out of order. The question I have is about the copies. Is there a certain way these need to be copied?\n\nYes, the copies should be double sided. If you have a printer that prints on both sides of the paper, you can choose to flip the paper on the short side to create the proper order. If you print the four pages single-sided and us a copy machine, orient the pages so that page 1 and page 3 are up and pages 2 and 4 are down. I will send you a snapshot personally, if you will send me your email address. I'm sorry you are having difficulty. pre-calculus and calculus threeThat's a good question. I use Smart Notebook 11 software to write my lessons for display. They are shared with my students through a projector but I use an wireless slate in order to teach the lessons \"Live\" to my students. The smart file that I sell is a blank document. You need to have the ability to work the problems on some wireless writing tablet. There are many that are compatible with Smart Technology products. I don't believe just a projector will work for this product. You can purchase the foldables only for this unit and write on that document under your document camera to display through the projector. If this is confusing, ask an \"IT\" person at your school. Unless you have a wireless tablet it would waste your money.\nThanks,\nJean Adams\n\nHi Chris,\nThanks for the vote on my clean writing style. Yes, I do sell the whole Quadratics Unit as a set. You can purchase the Foldables only at  or Smart Notes only, as well.\n\nMy students buy a small composition book at the beginning of the school year. The last page of each Foldable is blank so they apply glue and glue them into their book each day. I have some students who work their homework after each lesson in the composition book. They use two books each year in that case. Then, I have some students who store their lessons in a Gallon-Sized Zip-Lock Bag. I really see \"ownership\" in what they do by the way they protect each document and never want me to skip any example.\n\nHi Amy,\nYes they will. I've got three more to finish. Hopefully, today. There are nine in all. I got behind with Thanksgiving and Christmas. Sorry. I know you are waiting. I'm working on them now.\nThanks for your loyalty.\nJean\n\nYes, it should include 5 documents, a cover page, the foldable as a PDF file, the Final notes as a PDF File, the SmartBoard Lesson, and direction for making the foldable. I'll repost the files for you. Sorry for the inconvenience.\nThanks for letting me know.\nJean Adams\n\nIs it intended that the section of student notes on Extrema on an Interval is missing some information and examples that are in the filled in teacher version? The other units I have purchased matched up exactly to one another...\n\nI'll check into that for you. Thanks for the watchful eye.\nJean\nYes Amy, Actually my students had a difficult time with this idea last year. They forgot to check the endpoints, so we went back to the notes, revisited the procedure, thought about a few \"What if\" situations, and I just left that in the presentation to give a little extra while we talked and taught the lesson. So it is intentional.\n\nNovember 26, 2012\n\nmkesselman re: Blank Unit Circle Small\n\nYou have an extra degree symbol at both 90 degrees and at 270 degrees.\n\nTwo questions: The file '4 Real Zeros of Polynomial Functions Cover.pdf' is generating an error message from Adobe that the file is damaged and cannot be repaired.\nWhat program is needed to open the file with the 'notebook' extension? Is this a SmartBoard file?\n\nYes, the *.PDF file was corrupt. I have uploaded a version that should work now. Please let me know if it doesn't.\nThe notebook extension is a SmartNotebook 11 document. You can open with a Smart Notebook 11 software, and I believe it is compatible with Prometheus products also. I personally use my presentation files only with the Smart Airliner Wireless slate.\n\nNo, I don't. I have a Smart Airliner Wireless Slate. It costs about $200 and allows me to walk around my room. I actually had an older model of SmartBoard and gave it up when the Wireless slate came out about 3 years ago. I love it. I'm no longer tied to the front of the classroom. Even my students can write on the slate from their seats. The software SMART NOTEBOOK 11 is a separate item, I write the lessons with that software and use the slate to teach the lesson.\n\nJean,\nI cannot get the Using Linear Models flipchart to open, the PDF's will open, and I have no problem opeining any other flipcharts. Is there any way you can email me the flipchart, my email is Gingerduckett@yahoo.com.\nThanks.\n\nAmy,\nI have the whole year available, but I'm currently uploading one unit at a time. There are seven total units. My future plans are to offer the entire year as a bundle, but that is in the future. I'm glad that you like my lessons and appreciate your positive feedback. I will definitely offer the entire year at a reduced price, just not sure what that will be at the present time.\nJean\n\nHi Layla,\nWhen we have open house, I use a quick lesson on making a foldable with my parents then I have them take notes on the foldable about our class, their students needs, and where to go for help. They leave with a product in hand on how to contact me, my website info, where to find tutoring, and what calculator needs their student will have.\nJean\n\nNovember 4, 2012\n\nvwasmuth re: CALCULUS DIFFERENTIATION UNIT: Lesson 7 Related Rates\n\nI have downloaded \"related rates\" but as I tried to extract it , a black window appeared with an error message . I updated my adobe reader. It looked for adobe air, so I updated it, but it could not continue due to an apparent error.\n\nHunter, I have a test with most of those items that I can share with you.

{"text":"Topology is a major branch of modern mathematics. Topology is often described as rubber sheet geometry. In geometry objects are considered rigid with fixed distances and angles, but in topology distances and angles can be deformed. In topology objects are treated as if they are made out of rubber, capable of being deformed.\nObjects are allowed to be bent, stretched or shrunk but not allowed to be ripped apart or cut.\n\nFor example, in topology a coffee mug and a doughnut are the same! This kind of equivalence is cleverly illustrated by the following animated gif written by Lucas V. Barbosa.\n\nIn this course we will develop the mathematical framework to understand some of these ideas.\n\nThe authors of our textbook write:\n\nTopology\nis generally considered to be one of the three linchpins of modern\nabstract mathematics (along with analysis and algebra). In the early\nhistory of topology, results were primarily motivated by investigations\nof real-world problems. Then, after the formal foundation for topology\nwas established in the first part of the twentieth century, the\nemphasis turned to its abstract development. However, within the past\nfew decades there has been a significant increase in the applications\nof topology to fields as diverse as economics, engineering, chemistry,\nmedicine, and cosmology.\n\nWhen\nyour instructor was a student (in the middle of the last century)\ntopologists never talked about applications – it is exciting to see the\nrange of applications that have been found for this abstract subject.\nBecause we have limited class time, our emphasis will be an\nintroduction to the theory of point-set topology (text chapters 0-7).\nStudents may wish to pursue some of these applications for individual\nprojects.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nMost of the work you will need to do in this class will require reading the textbook and solving homework exercises (these will focus on creating and explaining mathematical arguments). I\nexpect you to work collaboratively with other students and I hope you\nwill talk to me about any exercises you are unsure about (either face\nto face or via email). I will try to give sufficient lead time to make\nthis possible. Although I encourage you to work with others, I want\nyou to write up your solutions individually.\n\nIn\naddition to reading your homework exercises and talking with you in\nclass, I'd like you to take a few minutes each weekend to send me a\nbrief update on how things are going (an email journal).\nI won't grade these critically but I hope they will give me some\nguidance on how things are progressing and I will record that you have\nsent them.\n\nAfter we've worked through some preliminary definitions, I'd like you to think about possible topics for an individual project.\nThere are many topics in the textbook that I will not have time to\ndiscuss in class and you might want to choose one of these. (We'll\nstart putting together a list of topics and scheduling presentations\nafter the first six weeks.)

{"text":"Specification\n\nAims\n\nTo give an introduction to Lebesgue's theory of measure and integration on the set of real numbers R. To use this to find an appropriate setting in which to understand the convergence of Fourier series.\n\nBrief Description of the unit\n\nIt is often convenient to represent functions as Fourier series. However, the convergence of such series is a delicate issue closely related to the theory of integration. A standard approach to integration on the real line, formalised by Riemann, is based on partitioning the domain into smaller intervals. (This theory was described in MATH20101 but is not a prerequisite for the course.) This approach works in many situations but there are simple examples for which it fails. In the early 1900s, H. Lebesgue produced a better theory in which the key idea is to extend the notion of length from intervals to more complicated subsets of R. This started an area of mathematics it its own right, called Measure Theory. Most generally, this is about how one may sensibly assign a size to members of a collection of sets. One application of Lebesgue's ideas is that one can introduce a vector space of functions in which Fourier series appear in a natural way.\n\nThis course will appeal to students who have enjoyed MATH20101 or MATH20111 and MATH20122. It will be useful to student taking probability course courses in years three and four since the ideas of measure theory have a central role in probability theory.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nOn successful completion of this course unit students will\n\nunderstand how Lebesgue measure on R is defined,\n\nunderstand how measures may be used to construct integrals,\n\nknow the basic convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral,\n\nunderstand the relation between Fourier series and the Hilbert space of square integrable functions.","id":"/222","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9816558361053467,"__label__0":0.018364157527685165}}

Do you feel math stands between you and your career goals, or a better grade at school?\n\nQuick Arithmetic, Third Edition is the quickest and easiest way to teach yourself the basic math skills you need to advance on the job or in school. Using cartoons and a clear writing style, this practical guide provides a fresh start for learning or reviewing how to work with whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percentages. The book's proven self-teaching approach allows you to work at your own pace and learn only the material you need. Previews and objectives at the beginning of each section help you determine your particular needs, while self-tests, practice problems, and a final exam let you measure your progress and reinforce what you've learned.\n\nFor anyone who has ever felt intimidated by a page of numbers, Quick Arithmetic, Third Edition has the answers!\n\nCustomer Reviews:\n\nA bad start\n\nBy Robert Patton - August 30, 2006\n\nThis book looks decent on the whole, but it gets off to an annoyingly bad start. The way it is structured is that your ability to answer or not answer questions guides you to different sections within the book. The first chapter starts off with a preview quiz, to get you started on your path. Yet the very first question on the quiz has the wrong answer. So when you check your results and think you got it wrong - try it again. The answer given is off by 20. This would be unbelievable in a self teaching guide if I didn't have it right in front of me. I can understand a mistake here and there, but the very first question??!! And, of course, no way to contact the authors to see if they have released accurate answers or let them know. Now the entire book is suspect. There is also some confusion shortly after as the authors draw a clear distinction between a digit as a representation of an idea, then give a question using characters (which are the same, representations of sounds)... read more\n\nA great math refresher course\n\nBy M. kelton - January 6, 2007\n\nI found myself floundering while trying to help with Algebra ll homework.

{"text":"Discrete mathematics and finite mathematics differ in a number of ways. First, finite mathematics has a longer history and is therefore more stable in terms of course content. Finite mathematics courses emphasize certain particular mathematical tools which are useful in solving the problems of business and the social sciences. Discrete mathematics courses, on the other hand, emphasize a particular guiding principle for all mathematical inquiry, namely the \"algorithmic viewpoint.\" Discrete mathematics emphasizes mathematical induction and proofs, while finite mathematics avoids proofs and emphasizes applications and intuitive understanding. Because of this, finite mathematics is a terminal math course for many students, whereas discrete mathematics is an introductory course for its constituency. In spite of differences, courses in discrete and finite mathematics have similar prerequisites and cover a number of the same topics. The main difference between the two is the clientele served. Discrete mathematics courses serve mainly computer science students, and finite mathematics courses serve students from commerce and social science backgrounds. Therefore, and unfortunately, finite mathematics courses tend to be less rigorous. Given that mathematical expectations are rising for students in business and social sciences, a common course merging discrete and finite mathematics should be developed. A chart showing the overlap in the content of finite and discrete mathematics textbooks is attached.

You can store a real number or an expression that results in a real number to a memory variable. For storing complex numbers to memory, see page 31. S %q R %p Lets you store values to variables. Recalls the values of variables. Recalls variables by letter designation. Displays menu: CLR VAR: Y N. Select Y (yes) and press V to clear all memory variables and re-initialize seed in E.\nWhen you press S, a menu of variables displays: A, B, C, D, and E. Press \" or ! to select a variable. Press V, and the value of your last answer is stored into the variable you have selected. If that variable already contains a value, the new one will replace it. If you enter an expression and press S and then V, the TI-36X will simultaneously evaluate the expression and store the resulting value to the memory variable you select. Press %q to display the menu of memory variables. Press \" or ! to select the variable you wish to recall and press V. The value in this variable is inserted into your current entry at the cursor. Pressing R also displays the menu of memory variables, and you select the one you wish to recall. However, the variable name rather than the value itself is inserted into your current entry. Since the variable name contains the value, evaluation of the expression yields the same results. 14\nTi36eng1.doc TI-36X II Manual Linda Bower Revised: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Printed: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Page 14 of 48\nIn addition to serving as a memory variable, E stores a seed value to generate a random number when you are using the Probability function (see page 32).\nProblem A gravel quarry is opening two new pits: one is 350 meters by 560 meters, and the other is 340 meters by 610 meters.

To prepare for an integral, store the lower limit in memory variable A, the upper limit in memory B, and the number of intervals (from 1 to 99) in memory C. Press 0 and enter the expression, using memory variable A as the independent variable. Then press V. While the calculator is processing the data, CALC displays. When the calculation is successfully completed, the TI-36X will return the numerical value to the result line. In addition, the calculator will clear memory variable C; A and B will be equal to the upper limit. If A>B, or if C is not an integer 1-99, or if A, B, or C is undefined, Integrate Error will display, and A, B, and C will be cleared. If you want to solve a given problem again using a different number of intervals or different limits, enter values to store in memory variables A, B, and C. Then scroll to the integration problem in history and press V; the calculator will solve the same problem with the new data. The time the calculator takes to solve the problem depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of intervals. You can abort the calculation by pressing and holding T until Integrate Error is displayed. With polynomials up to the third degree, Simpsons rule yields the exact answer, so increasing the number of intervals will not change the results. However, with polynomials of higher degree and equations containing more complicated functions (such as trigonometry), increasing the number of intervals will improve the precision of the results. Note: When you perform integration with trigonometric functions, the calculator must be in radian mode. 30\n\nLN EXP PWR CLRDATA\n\nYou can enter up to 42 points or data pairs. When using the LN regression, you do not need to find the natural logarithms of the numbers. Enter the data directly, and the TI-36X makes the transformation. Similarly, when you want to make a prediction with the LN regression equation, you enter the value of x directly (and not ln x), and the calculator returns the predicted value of y (and not ln y).\nTi36eng1.doc TI-36X II Manual Linda Bower Revised: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Printed: 01/10/03 10:47 AM Page 34 of 48\nTo set up the problem and perform the analysis: 1.

Then: In 1-VAR stat mode, enter the frequency of occurrence (FRQ) of the data point and press $. FRQ default=1. If FRQ=0, the data point is ignored. Or, In LIN, LN, EXP, OR PWR, enter the value of Y and press $. 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all data points are entered. You can change or delete data points by scrolling to the desired point and editing or pressing '. If you are in 2-VAR mode, you must delete both the data point and the frequency. You can add new points by scrolling to the last point and pressing $; the calculator will prompt you for the new data. If you add or delete data points, the TI-36X automatically reorders the list. 6. When all points and frequencies are entered: Press 8 to display the menu of variables (see table for definitions) and their current values. Or, Press 7 to return to the blank STAT screen. You can perform calculations with data variables (, , etc.). After such calculations, you can return to the display of variables by pressing 8 again.

{"text":"the only conceptual demand that is somewhat independent of the context is manipulating the algebraic expression to yield simpler algebraic expressions. That activity is very important, however, since it allows the student to see at a glance why the result for the above problem is always x+3, whatever the value of x. The evolving sequence of simplified algebraic expressions can permit a perception of \"x+3-ness\" in a way that is not so readily available from simply reading the problem. Thus, the algebraic representation can induce an awareness of structure that is much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve using everyday language.\n\nOne hundred eighteen algebra students who had already taken algebra for a year were given Problem A. Only nine set up the expression (5x+12–x)/4 and then reduced it algebraically to x+3. Four of them went on to \"demonstrate further\" by substituting a couple of numerical values for x. Thirty-four others set up the equation (5x+12–x)/4=x+3 and then proceeded to simplify the left side, yet they did not base their conclusions on their algebraic work. Instead, they worked numerical examples and drew conclusions from them.\n\nFor the great majority of students, therefore, this task posed enormous problems both in representing a general statement and in using that statement to justify numerical arguments. According to the researchers, these students seemed completely lost when asked to use algebra. \"Formulating the algebraic generalization was not a major problem for the [few] students who chose to do so; using it and appreciating it as a general statement was where these students failed.\"66 Therefore, for the students who responded to the request to use algebra, their difficulties were related not to the simplification of the expression but to the third of the conceptual demands outlined above: being aware that the algebraic result constitutes a proof or justification of the arithmetical result that one obtains empirically by trying several numbers. This research also suggests that even when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation. Without some skill with symbolic manipulations, however, students are unlikely to use algebra to justify generalizations.\n\nEven when students are successfully taught symbolic manipulation, they may fail to see the power of algebra as a tool for representing the general structure of a situation.\n\nPredicting Patterns\n\nTasks involving geometric and numerical patterns are a frequent means of introducing students to the use of algebra for predicting.

It's the sort of book that you would use to explore new topics that you might not have seen before.\n\nQuote:\n\nAm I missing some more general topics or good resources?\n\nIf you're interested in getting deeper into math, you'll probably want to find a book that helps you to transition from computation into proof-based mathematics. Proofs are things that you don't really see in the high school math level. I like \"How to Think Like a Mathematician\" as a much gentler introduction than the more classic \"A Transition to Advanced Mathematics\" (and much less expensive).\n\nThere's another book on the market called \"How to Prove It\" but I've not read it so I can't say how good/bad it is. It seems to have decent reviews.\n\nDoing questions/exercises is essential for quick progress in low-level maths.\n\nIn some of MIT's modules there are example sheets & solutions, which is good.\n\nBasically, I would start by going and getting a basic book off amazon on algebra and/or geometry. Maybe a standard book on it, or just a questions and answer book.\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"algebra\" though, as algebra is quite broad.\n\nBut yeah, work through a million questions, get used to things... don't be afraid to ask stuff on internet forums (like on 2+2) and also it's good to ask people you know if they're good enough and are willing to teach you a thing or two.\n\nI'm not a math guy but this seems a bit narrow. I don't know how you'd get a good general overview, because there are dozens or hundreds of mathematical fields, often with overlap, but I know calculus and ODEs and I wouldn't say I \"know math\" even remotely.\n\nIt seems like abstract algebra is a good starting place since people who do \"know math\" seem to reference it a lot - set theory and number theory maybe? College-level geometry would probably be nice. Mathematical logic? Complex analysis?\n\nI've learned some things in data structures, algorithms, numerical analysis, combinatorics, and computability theory, mostly as a result of reading about computer programming. That stuff is awesome to me but I don't even know how you'd get there from a \"general mathematics\" background. If you want computer math I recommend those topics though, I doubt you can do much with computers unless you have at least data structures, algorithms, and computability theory - but for \"more discrete\" tasks combinatorics is a must, and for \"more continuous\" tasks you really need numerical analysis. Might even want to study some more programming-related stuff too, knowing how floating-point types are implemented would be awfully valuable if you ever want to do math-related code.\n\nI'll use 'How to Think Like a Mathematician' by Kevin Houston and skip 'The Princeton Companion' for now. Proofs seem to be very important and indeed in high-school we focused on computations.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by jewbinson\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"algebra\" though, as algebra is quite broad.\n\nThat's just the high-school algebra I see often mentioned together with trigonometry as a prereq. for a course in calculus.\n\nI've already refreshed some high-school stuff.

{"text":"John Foradori's Math Blog\nTips to survive the mathematics journey!Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000en-UShourly1 algebra classes\n 12 Jul 2012 13:01:03 +0000John Foradori have fallen in love with the function-approach to algebra, and if I were teaching algebra 1, or even below that (as the CCSSM allows), everything would be taught from the perspective of a function.\n\nStarting with functions from day one, you can reinforce everything about the functions, domains, ranges, families, etc with each and every lesson (just about!).\n\noperations on expressions? Yep, start with a function that has the expressions you want. You can get so much more out of it. This can lead to so much more understanding. In class right now, students are dealing with rational functions in the form f(x)=a/(x-h) +k, finding the characteristics, then rewriting it as a quotient of two polynomials and comparing the graphs. Good stuff, and can be done with every type of function. I think it gives meaning to algebraic manipulation, why do we do it, what happens when we do it, and how does it really change the original function. These are powerful questions whose answers give real depth and meaning to the algebra classes.\n\nI went through the EMATHS training, but the classes I taught never really let me explore the shifts that strongly (namely statistics and AP Calculus). I had a feeling that the function-based approach was, in my opinion, stronger and more flexible than the other way, but since I never had a chance to really explore it, it wasn't cemented.\n\nIt is now. Everything that can be done in a math class can be done from a function perspective and so much more. I will never go back!\n\nThere have been questions about learning procedures, the rigor of some of the algebraic skills like \"simplifying\" expressions, applying properties, etc. It's all there, all of it. It's just a different way of getting there.\n\nI will leave this with a story. Since we were converting a rational function from one form to another, and to get the students thinking about what is going on, I took a piece of paper and told them this was a function. We can do a lot with a function in this form, and we came up with a lot of uses for it. Then I crumpled up the paper and asked how I changed the paper. Did I add anything? Did I take anything away? Is it still that original piece of paper, just dressed up differently? Then I asked about the uses of my crumpled up piece of paper. Can I do the same things? Can I do different things? I highlighted the different uses of the wad of paper by playfully tossing it around the room. When we discuss this as a group, hopefully we will get to the point that even if a function is in a different form, it really hasn't changed (check the graphs), but the uses for it have.\n\nWouldn't it be great if that idea can be reinforced almost all the time in Algebra 1 and Geometry, and not just at the end of the 3rd unit of Algebra 2?\n\nThe last couple of days have been heavy on the direct instruction. I saw that this group wasn't getting too much out of working in groups, and since the upcoming topics (logs, log properties, solving exponential and log equations) could be approached a little more traditional, I made the command decision to focus on small chunks of information and practice. So far, it's working pretty well.\n\nThese students are solving the equations graphically and then algebraically, which is all I can ask for right now. They are getting more and more comfortable with the tech and with the content, which will lead to next week and more group work on some exploration activities. They are making pretty good progress!\n\nThe room is filling up with a ton of chart paper: formula walls, word walls, procedure walls, Nspire shortcut walls…running out of walls!\n\n]]> Summer School Adventure! #1\n 30 Jun 2012 13:56:48 +0000John Foradori all (anyone that is taking time from their summer vacation to read this!)\n\nI am one week in, and I have learned quite a bit of interesting things. I'll give a brief synopsis of the fun so far:\n\n1. Set-up\nSetting up the technology was a bit of an issue. The biggest thing was getting the Ti-Navigator set up and running. I had to upgrade the operating systems first and do a lot of the hardware upgrades. Not a big deal, and not unexpected, but it took a few days to get them started. Finally, on Wednesday, I got the bugs worked out of the navigator, the class set up, and everything working. More on that later!\n\n2. The Teaching\nEven being out of the classroom for only a year made the first couple of days a bigger challenge than I anticipated. My last classroom experience was a class I taught at Macomb CC, which is a little different than teaching in high school. I found myself falling back into that routine a little bit more than the high school routine. It took a couple of days for me, but I hit a groove during the day on Thursday.\n\n3. The Students\nIt took a while to get them into the swing of things as well. Summer school is an interesting experience, and can be a very dry, extremely oppressive atmosphere (in my opinion) for the students. Since it is credit recovery, they are there because of past failures, and their attitudes about math and math classes are very negative. Put them in a room that is high stakes, for five hours a day, and this could lead to a very negative atmosphere. So far, though, the students have been really good and have been participating, especially in the last couple of days. In fact, they are very engaged, and I think I've found the reason for it:\n\nThe Navigator System.\n\nOnce I got this thing up and running, and once I got used to it (it took me a couple of days, and I think the class slowed a bit because of it), things started to roll! For example, yesterday we were dealing with exponential functions. We had a whole class discussion of what exponential growth was (I use The Matrix as an example, when Agent Smith, the bad program, develops the power to copy himself, and we discuss how long it takes him to take over a world with 8 billion people in it). With some guidance on my part, we developed the function f(x)=1*2^x, and what all the parts of the function were. I expanded it to f(x)= initial value * (growth factor)^x. We worked through some examples of finding the parts of the function, the initial value and growth factor. ( f(x)=a*(1+r)^x )\n\nInstead of the typical \"give the students a couple of minutes, let the brave one give the answer and move on,\" way of trying to tell if the students get the answer, I sent out a quick poll. It is amazing that when there is an accountability on the screen showing how many people have or haven't answered, how fast the answers come in.\n\nEvery student had an answer, and we had a discussion about the answers, about every student's answers. There were about 3 misconceptions that came up that we were able to address immediately. Every student saw their answer on the screen, and I was able to give instantaneous feedback, and students got instantaneous feedback.\n\nThis is a form of formative assessment (FA), and I've used it a lot over the last couple of days. It is amazing how effective FA's are at clearing up misconceptions fast and moving the class forward. I was trying to use them before I left the classroom, but I don't think I fully \"got it\" then. I get it now. Granted, I have a great tool to use, the navigator, and not all the math teachers have them. There are other ways to get them going. More on that in the future.\n\nI am rambling, too much coffee. I will discuss more of my views and experiences as we go through the summer.\n\nHighlights:\n—I love the technology!\n—Formative Assessments are a huge key to moving a class forward. (and you don't need the tech to do it, you just need some creativity)\n—Get the students engaged, working, and hold them to it!\n—These students, who hate math, are showing improvement!\n—Give them hope that they can do it, give them tasks that they can succeed on, and build on that success.\n\n]]> Wormeli on Differentiation\n 06 Jan 2012 18:50:10 +0000John Foradori is an excellent source on Differentiated Instruction.

This requires only minimal input including three components: the equation of the function, its starting point, and the incremental changes between independent variable values. By formatting the spreadsheet to depend on these three things, the input values (and the calculated output values) are easily manipulated, allowing for changes in scale.},\nmsc2010 = {I20xx (U70xx)},\nidentifier = {2013b.00681},\n}","id":"/291","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9990106225013733,"__label__0":0.0010094306198880076}}

{"text":"Continuing Education\n\nQ: As a mathematical amateur no longer attending university, I miss the stimulation\nof taking a math course. If my interest were modern languages (for example), I\ncould take what they call 'continuing education' courses at almost any college\nor university, but for the mathematical enthusiast these institutions seemingly\nhave nothing. Can anybody suggest a comparable alternative?\n\nA:Why does 'continuing education' not include (at least potentially) math? At one\nuniversity I know (George Mason U.), they have a category called 'Extended Studies',\nopen more-or-less to anyone paying the tuition, and it is certainly possible to take\ncourses (including graduate-level) under that dispensation. There may be limits on\nhow many you can take, etc., but it is routinely used by non-students who want to\nsample a course or two, for genuine 'continuing education', or as a way to help\ndecide if they want to enroll in a degree program. (And if they do, the courses\ntaken under Extended Studies count.) Not all colleges/universities are going to be\nthat open, nor should they be. But many are. The kind of program that would be\nideal for you is the Johns Hopkins Part-time Programs in Science/Engineering\n( which has math courses (which I've taken.) You are\nprobably not near the JH area (Baltimore/Washington), but I mention it to indicate\nthat such programs do exist. These programs, like Mason, consciously cater to a\nbroad professional audience, people already working in a field who would like to\ntake a course here-and-there, or even work on an advanced degree in the evening.\nFor that to be possible the university must be located in an area that has such a\npotential clientele, which generally means a large urban area. If you're not in\nsuch a locale, it may not be possible to find what you want. But if you are, and if\nthere are several colleges around, I'd bet an aggressive search would turn up\nsomething.\nSupposedly, MIT has put all its courses online for free.

{"text":"Classes are not aimed exclusively towards math competitions. Instead, IDEA Math is a program that can help students\ndevelop logical thinking and problem solving skills in the long run. We have found that our program not only broadens and\ndeepens the students' knowledge and skills in mathematics, but also help them develop perseverance and creativity that\nwill benefit them in the long-run, regardless of their career paths.\n\nI have taken IDEA MATH classes last year, will the classes be repeated for next year?\n\nWe have reorganized our series this year so that the majority of the material will be brand new. In future\nyears, students could choose to move up from one series to another. Moreover, if a student chooses to be in a series for two\nyears in a row, we will insert new problems and concepts into that series from year to year.\n\nHow am I (the student) evaluated? Are there any evaluation tests?\n\nDuring each of the 6-week courses, there will be two 1 to 1.5 hour tests to check each student's progress. One test will be in\nthe middle of the course, and the other will be at the end. The tests are intended as check points. They\nare not evaluations.\n\nSince we focus on contest preparation, there will be various forms of mock contests. Scores/results will be\nkept only for the purpose of practicing, not for evaluation. We try to use these activities to stimulate students' interest and\nget them used to the contest atmosphere, instead of pressuring them through evaluation.\n\nWho shall I meet at IDEA MATH?\n\nOther capable students from the Massachusetts area who are passionate about mathematics. Many of our students have developed\nlasting friendships with their IDEA MATH peers, and many have learned a great deal from their peers as well as their instructors.\n\nWhat is the difference between IDEA MATH and what I am learning in school?\n\nThe depth. At IDEA MATH, we do not focus on introducing students to higher math concepts, say Calculus. However, we go into\nmuch greater depth with topics covered in a middle/high school curriculum. For example, an eighth grade geometry math class may\ncover the triangle are formula of base times height divided by two, but our Math Roots Series will introduce students to three\nor four more important ways to calculate the same area. Students will see the connection between these different ways.\n\nCan I sit in for a class?\n\nUsually we do not allow sit-ins. However, we do encourage all prospective students to join us for the Open House.\n\nApplication\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nYou need do online registration first (creat your account), take the evaluation test, and then register course online.\n\nSmall Group and Private Lessons\n\nDo you offer private lessons?\n\nYes. We offer lessons for all mathematical subjects, standardized tests and competitions for small groups and individuals.\n\nHow do I schedule a private or small group lesson?\n\nPlease call (603)686-1706 or email info@ideamath.org.\n\nWhat is the rate of private and small group lesson?\n\nThe price varies by the subjects, levels and the group's size, with a range from $40 to $100 per hour per person.\nPlease contact us for specifics.","id":"/303","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9477263689041138,"__label__0":0.05229363963007927}}

{"text":"Synopsis\n\nAn accessible guide to developing intuition and skills for solving mathematical problems in the physical sciences and engineering\n\nEquations play a central role in problem solving across various fields of study. Understanding what an equation means is an essential step toward forming an effective strategy to solve it, and it also lays the foundation for a more successful and fulfilling work experience. Thinking About Equations provides an accessible guide to developing an intuitive understanding of mathematical methods and, at the same time, presents a number of practical mathematical tools for successfully solving problems that arise in engineering and the physical sciences.\n\nEquations form the basis for nearly all numerical solutions, and the authors illustrate how a firm understanding of problem solving can lead to improved strategies for computational approaches. Eight succinct chapters provide thorough topical coverage, including:\n\nApproximation and estimation\n\nIsolating important variables\n\nGeneralization and special cases\n\nDimensional analysis and scaling\n\nPictorial methods and graphical solutions\n\nSymmetry to simplify equations\n\nEach chapter contains a general discussion that is integrated with worked-out problems from various fields of study, including physics, engineering, applied mathematics, and physical chemistry. These examples illustrate the mathematical concepts and techniques that are frequently encountered when solving problems. To accelerate learning, the worked example problems are grouped by the equation-related concepts that they illustrate as opposed to subfields within science and mathematics, as in conventional treatments. In addition, each problem is accompanied by a comprehensive solution, explanation, and commentary, and numerous exercises at the end of each chapter provide an opportunity to test comprehension.\n\nRequiring only a working knowledge of basic calculus and introductory physics, Thinking About Equations is an excellent supplement for courses in engineering and the physical sciences at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and educators in all branches of engineering, physics, chemistry, biophysics, and other related fields who encounter mathematical problems in their day-to-day","id":"/314","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9590853452682495,"__label__0":0.04093465954065323}}

{"text":"A book on basic math that explains how math really works\n\nA book on basic math that explains how math really works\n\nPlease, recommend me a book (or books) on basic math/pre-algebra that really explains how math works from the inside out. What I mean by that is a book that goes really deeply into exploring math giving you true understanding of what's going on behind the scenes so to speak. For example, why the long division method even works, why when dividing one fraction by another fraction is supposed to be carried out the way it is, why dividing by zero doesn't really make much sense, why a negative number multiplied by another negative number gives a positive number and stuff like that. So a book that gives the basis for basic math and arithmetics. Not like the books which only explain how to superficially perform math operations and algorithms. I looked into the for dummies series, but they are all like that, don't provide you with that kind of explanation.\n\nI don't really think that such a book exists. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of books that explain exactly what you want. A lot of books explain how the long division works, how multiplication of fractions works, why multiplication of negative numbers result in a positive number. The problem is that such a book is usually quite advanced. The subject that treats such questions is abstract algebra, and it's a college-level math course.\n\nFurthermore, if you want everything to be explained, then you will need to deal with proofs. So before reading abstract algebra, you should read up on mathematical proofs.\n\nIf you wish to try out abstract algebra, then I can recommend the book \"A first course in Algebra\" by Fraleigh. Everybody who is familiar with proofs will be able to tackle this book. But it will still be a difficult read.\nIf you want to do proofs and sets first, then Velleman's \"how to prove it\" is a good read.\n\nI realize that I have not been helpful at all. As I understood your questions, you wanted easy books that explain everything. I have given you hard books. The problem is that there are no easy books that explain it all (as far as I'm aware). I think your best bet is posting the questions you have on the forums here. That way you won't have to read an entire book.\n\nAlgebra by Gelfand is well motivated and fairly rigorous (at least for high school algebra standards). Lectures on Elementary Mathematics by Lagrange also seems to be like something you are looking for (you may find it online here).\n\nMost arithmetic algorithmic (e.g. long/synthetic division, multiplication with multi-digit numbers, &c.), however, are things that you should easily be able to justify on your own if you know a bit of algebra.\n\nIf you want to find out how mathematics is done, I'd recommend watching Vi Hart's Youtube channel and reading Hilbert's Geometry and Imagination.\n\nMacLane? Really? That may be too advanced, don't you think? The OP asks for a book on basic math/pre-algebra!\n\nWell, I've read just the beginning, but it seems any person could understand a lot of this book. Look at wiki entry. I guess at least first part of the book is readable by anyone. It definitely is \"behind the scenes\" book. But yeah, this is perhaps too much philosophy, it seems the OP is looking for something more practical.\n\nI think it to a large degree is a matter of psychological satisfaction, which can vary between individuals; some people ask the question \"Why?\" more often than others. Eventually, you'll hit a wall where you feel satisfied with the mathematical theory \"behind\" things. Personally, I'm using \"Basic Mathematics\" by Serge Lang as complementary studying in high school right now, and I think it's enough for me. However, it's probably not for you because it assumes some things without proof, like distributivity, associativity and commutativity. I, on the other hand, think it's OK to do so since I think I have a sufficient intuitive understanding why those properties must be true.\n\nI would suggest that you look into the above mentioned books and see if something fits you. Good luck!","id":"/321","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9757013916969299,"__label__0":0.024318592622876167}}

{"text":"ACCELERATED PRE-CALCULUS SUMMER STUDY GUIDE\n\nCHAPTER 12: SETS, RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS\n\nA \"set\" is a collection of \"objects.\" Each object in the set is called an \"element of the set.\" The elements usually have something in common.\n\nFor example, the following, {monkey, bear, lion, giraffe, zebra}, is called a set of elements. What do these elements have in common? One answer might be that they are animals in a local zoo.\n\nNotice the symbols \"{\" and \"}\". We will call theses symbols \"set enclosures.\"\"{\" is the \"left set enclosure\" and \"}\" is the \"right set enclosure.\"\n\nThe following set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...} is a collection of objects that are numbers. The elements are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and what these elements have in common is that they are positive even numbers. Notice that the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...} has 3 periods after the number 10. These three periods, called \"ellipsis,\" mean \"and so forth\" or suggest that the elements in a set continue on forever or as mathematicians say \"continue on to infinity.\"\n\nWhen we need to represent some \"recognizable pattern\" mathematicans often use ellipsis. Consider the following set: {3, 6, 9,..., 90, 93, 96}. I have left out many numbers from this set but the ellipses suggest I am incrementing each subsequent number by 3 and the set contains all the numbers incremented by 3, starting at 3, going to the number 96.\n\nCan you see the pattern in the following? {...1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...} If you take any number in this set and multiply it by 2 you will get the next number in the set. Pattern recognition skills are very important in the world of mathematics!\n\nSECTION 12.2: DOMAIN, RANGE, RELATION\n\nLet's look at this set: { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } This is a set of ordered pairs which can be used to represent points in the Cartesian Coordinate System. The points below can be represented by our set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }.\n\nThe set of x-values of a set of ordered pairs { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is named the \"domain.\" The domain in this instance is {-2, 1, -1, 5}.\n\nThe set of y-values of a set of ordered pairs is named the \"range.\" The range in this instance is {4, 3, -2, -3}.\n\nThe set of ordered pairs is also named a \"relation.\" So { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is a relation.\n\nans: The domain is {5, 4, 3, 6} and the range is {–3, 6, –1, 3} Comment: Notice that the x coordinate, 5, occurs twice in {(5, –3), (4, 6), (3, –1), (6, 6), (5, 3)}. Mathematicians have agreed to write an x value in the domain once even though it may occur more than once in the relation. The same goes for the range: notice the y coordinate 6 occurs twice in the relation but is written only once in the range.\n\nThere is a very special \"relation\" called a \"function.\" Functions are very powerful in the world of applications as we will see in Chapter 16 of this manual.\n\nWHAT IS A FUNCTION?\n\nIf each x-value of a relation has one unique y-value assigned to it, then the relation is named a \"function.\"\n\nex. 1) { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function! Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. Note the ordered pairs in blue. The x-value 1 has two different y-values, 3 and 5.\nHence, we say { (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is not a function.\n\nex. 2) { (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) } is called a function.\nWhy? Because each x-value has only 1 y value.\n\nex. 3) { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function. Look at the set of ordered pairs to your left. The x-value -7 has three different y-values 5,4,and -2. Hence, we say { (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) } is not a function.\n\nex. 4) { (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) } is a function.\nWhy? Because each unique x-value has only 1 y-value.\n\nCOMMENT: All functions are relations but not all relations are functions. Remember, a relation is nothing more than a set of ordered pairs.\n\n12.4 GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS VERSES NON-FUNCTIONS\n\nA set of ordered pairs that is a function will have more than one point falling on a vertical line. Let's compare the graph of a function to a graph of a non function.\n\nFUNCTION\n\nNOT A FUNCTION\n\n{ (1,3), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }\n\n{ (1,3), (1, 5), (-2,4), (5,-2), (-1,-3) }\n\nFUNCTION\n\nNOT A FUNCTION\n\n{ (7,-2), (-2,-2), (4,-2), (-3,-2) }\n\n{ (7,5), (-7, 5), (-7,4), (-7,-2), (6,-3) }\n\nWe will be looking at functions in greater depth in chapter 16.

{"text":"CalcPlot3D, an Exploration Environment for Multivariable Calculus\n\nUsing CalcPlot3D to Visually Verify Homework in Multivariable Calculus\n\nOne way to use CalcPlot3D, a versatile Java applet, is to demonstrate new concepts during multivariable calculus lectures. I often develop a new concept on the chalk board first and then take a couple minutes to make the concept come to life using the applet. Students find these demonstrations helpful and fun, and they bring variety to my presentations, helping students process the new concepts in a new way.\n\nAn even more exciting way to use CalcPlot3D in class is to engage in a visual exploration of new concepts using \"What if…\" types of questions. An example of a topic for which I find this approach works especially well is exploring the variety of possible parameterizations of a plane/space curve, paying special attention to the behavior of the velocity and acceleration vectors. Using these sorts of visual demonstrations in class improves student learning, but to fully engage students in the exploration and discovery process and give them the best chance of learning the geometric nature of the calculus concepts, I feel it is vital to give students opportunities to \"play\" with the concepts visually themselves. This article focuses on one way this can be done: by requiring students to visually verify solutions to particular homework problems and turn these in for a grade. [Another way this project supports student engagement and \"play\" is with the guided explorations being developed for various concepts. See the main project website to explore these. At this writing, there are explorations for Dot Products, Cross Products, Velocity & Acceleration Vectors, and Lagrange Multiplier Optimization.]\n\nBelow is a list of example topics where I often assign this type of visual verification exercise to my students to get them to begin using the applet on their own. Once they start using the applet in this way (because they have to), students often report using the applet more often on their own to explore additional exercises they complete from the textbook and on other assignments. Before giving a visual verification assignment involving new skills with the applet, I always demonstrate using CalcPlot3D to visually verify a similar problem we worked on the board. Once students have seen one example using the applet, most have little trouble completing the exercise on their own.\n\nWithout further discussion, let's look at some examples of how this can be done! As you develop your own examples, please send them along to me! I would love to develop a library of useful ways to use this applet.","id":"/338","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9780462384223938,"__label__0":0.02197372540831566}}

{"text":"Abstract\n\nA not-insignificant number of undergraduate engineers have problems with mathematics. School mathematics often has to be reinforced during undergraduate studies, where a lack of\nunderstanding at the lower level often impedes learning at the higher level. Here, visualisations can help - either by contextualising the mathematics, or by using graphical\nvisualisations. In this latter case, \"A picture is worth a thousand words\" is most appropriate. However, even students who have problems rearranging equations are almost invariably able to \"read\", understand and draw graphs - basically visualisations of mathematical equations, be\nthey as simple as the straight-line equation or as complicated as the solution of a second-order\npartial differential equation. Consequently, displaying graphs (i.e. visualising) can help deepen insight into mathematical processes. This, in turn, can raise a student's mathematical proficiency, predilection, awareness and eventual achievement. This paper deals with, amongst others, the following questions. Does using MathinSite improve mathematical achievement and if so, how? How does using MathinSite score over other computer-based learning techniques?","id":"/348","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9859697818756104,"__label__0":0.014050173573195934}}
{"text":"Summary of Content: The success of applied mathematics in describing the world around us arises from the use of mathematical models, often using ordinary and partial differential equations. This module continues the development of such models, building on the modules G11CAL and G11APP. It introduces techniques for studying linear and nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, using linearisation and phase planes. Partial differential equation models are introduced and analysed. These are used to describe the flow of heat, the motion of waves and traffic flow. Continuum models are introduced to describe the flow of fluids (liquids and gases, such as the oceans or the Earth's atmosphere).\n\nMethod and Frequency of Class:\n\nActivity\n\nNumber Of Weeks\n\nNumber of sessions\n\nDuration of a session\n\nLecture\n\n22 weeks\n\n1 per week\n\n2 hours\n\nLecture\n\n22 weeks\n\n1 per week\n\n1 hour\n\nActivities may take place every teaching week of the Semester or only in specified weeks.

{"text":"MAA Review\n\n[Reviewed by Mark Hunacek, on 09/06/2012]\n\nA student learning special relativity for the first time must contend not only with counter-intuitive concepts such as time dilation and length contraction but also with fairly cumbersome equations such as the Lorentz equations\n\nx' = γ (x – vt)\n\nt' = γ (t – (v/c2)x)\n\n(where γ = 1/√(1-v2/c2) and c is the speed of light), which relate the position and time of an observer O at rest and a moving observer O'. The novel idea of this slim, succinct book is to seek to replace reliance on these equations with geometric reasoning. Of course the \"geometry\" here is not the ordinary Euclidean geometry we all learned in high school, and which is based on circles in the sense that the set of all points at distance 1 from the origin is a circle. Here, instead, the geometry is based on hyperbolas: the squared distance of a point (x, y) from the origin is defined to be x2 – y2, so the \"unit circle\" in this geometry is really a hyperbola. The ordinary trigonometric functions are then replaced by the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh, applied to angles that show up in spacetime diagrams. (Such a diagram plots the position x and time t of an object, with t running up the vertical axis and x moving along the horizontal one; thus, for example, a vertical line depicts an object that stays motionless as time passes.)\n\nThe book starts with two introductory chapters, the first of which (very) rapidly contrasts Newton's and Einstein's physics and the second of which functions as a quick overview of the physics of special relativity, including the derivation of the Lorentz equations from the two basic postulates of special relativity (that the laws of physics apply in all inertial reference frames and that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers). This is followed by two chapters on Euclidean \"circle geometry\" and the non-Euclidean \"hyperbola geometry\" that will be used throughout the book, introducing the hyperbolic trigonometric functions from several different (but equivalent) points of view.\n\nThe geometry of special relativity begins in earnest with the next chapter, which introduces spacetime diagrams and a particular angle in them called the rapidity, which turns out to be the angle between a worldline and the vertical (ct) axis (ct, rather than t, because we want to measure time and space in the same units). The ideas developed here are exploited in two subsequent chapters (\"Applications\" and \"Paradoxes\") which discuss the geometric ideas behind such topics as length contraction, time dilation, the twins paradox, and others.\n\nThere are then three (non-consecutive) chapters that struck me as the most demanding in the book: chapter 9, on relativistic mechanics, addresses the relationship between mass and energy and gives insight into the famous equation E = mc2; chapter 11, on relativistic electromagnetism (which, thanks to my dismal background in physics, I only dimly understood) unifies electricity and magnetism; chapter 13 provides a warp-speed look at general relativity.\n\nThe book concludes with two chapters that are really just straight mathematics, no physics: one chapter (\"Hyperbolic Geometry\") discusses various models for hyperbolic geometry, and the other (\"Calculus\") offers a geometric derivation of the trigonometric and exponential functions.\n\nThere are thirteen substantial worked-out examples in the book, all of which struck me as both interesting and illuminating; instead of scattering them throughout the text the author puts them all in three chapters (7, 10 and 12) devoted entirely to them. There are no exercises, but the author does occasionally explicitly leave something to the reader to ponder, such as the resolution of the \"manhole cover\" paradox in chapter 8.\n\nDespite the fact that there are at least two other books (one quite recent) with titles that are very similar to this book's, Dray's approach really does appear to be novel. Dragon's new book The Geometry of Special Relativity: A Concise Course, for example, seems (based on an admittedly cursory glance) to be addressed to a considerably more sophisticated audience than is this text, and while geometric ideas are certainly mentioned the ones that are discussed in Dray do not appear to take center stage in Dragon. There is also a book by Callahan with the similar-sounding title The Geometry of Spacetime, but that book is considerably different than this one; unlike this text, it covers both general and special relativity (so \"geometry\" as used in the title of that book really refers to differential geometry, which finds extensive use) and the discussion of special relativity in the first half of the book emphasizes linear algebra notation; matrix computations appear throughout. This is consistent with a primary idea in Dray's book (that the Lorentz transformation is really just a hyperbolic rotation) but the manner of presentation is different. (Anybody planning to look at both books should also note that Callahan, in contravention of what I believe is now standard practice, uses the horizontal, rather than vertical, axis for time.) Finally, I should perhaps mention Taylor and Wheeler's Spacetime Physics, endorsed by the author but unseen by me, which apparently contained a lot of this material in its first edition but left much out of it out of the second.\n\nThe question then arises, of course, whether \"novel\" necessarily means \"better\". I found that the geometric discussions did shed some light on the underlying ideas, but I also thought at times that the calculations used in them were just disguised versions of the calculations used from a more traditional approach (which, I think, any serious student of special relativity should be familiar with, since these ideas appear so frequently in the literature). So, while I enjoyed reading this book and certainly learned from it, I tend to think that it would serve best as a supplemental text for a course in special relativity rather than as a main text. (The very succinct writing style, and the total lack of homework exercises, also influenced this opinion.) The author himself may think this, because he writes in the preface that the book \"is not intended as a replacement for any of the excellent textbooks on special relativity\" but is intended as an introduction \"to a particularly beautiful way of looking at special relativity… encouraging students to see beyond the formulas to the deeper structure.\" This goal, I think, has been met: on more than one occasion as I read this book I found myself looking at other texts to compare discussions, and I generally found that the process seemed to have a synergistic effect: I got more out of both books by doing this. This is unquestionably a book that anybody who teaches special relativity will want to look at.","id":"/356","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9824098348617554,"__label__0":0.017610130831599236}}

{"text":"In answer to your other questions\n\n>>Anyways, must I learn the analytic geometry if I just want to make simple programs that resemble something of 3d, but maybe not 100% accurate?\n\nNo, you can write very simple programs without understanding the maths. But that's all you'll be able to do. If you learn a little more, you'll be able to go much further. And you'll be able to make more sense of the maths on Wikipedia.\n\n>>They don't teach any useful math at school and they aren't any time soon so I don't know where to start learning\n\nDon't forget that it's more important to a teacher that the dull students aren't left behind, than the bright students get ahead. Maybe you can find a teacher who is willing to explain something to you outside of class. Or maybe a parent or relative of yours could help.\n\nAt my school there was a maths society where we explored topics outside of the curriculum...\n\nHaving a good teacher is probably the best way to learn this sort of stuff, but failing that a good book might be helpful. Check your library for something that's at the right level for you.\n\n>>And I don't what this type of stuff means:\n\n>>sin^2 (x) <<????\n\nBasically, computer programmers need to make sure the computer understands them. Mathematicians need to make sure that other mathematicians understand them. So while programming languages tend to be fairly simple and consistent, mathematical notation is much less so.\n\nAlso remember that mathematics until recently was nearly always written by hand, and even today much is written by hand. A notation that's easier to read in slightly messy writing is a winner.\n\nThere are many areas of mathematics where there are a few different notations in popular usage. Often say Europe will use one notation and the US will use another.\n\nAnyway, this is one case where \"everybody knows\" that sin^2(x) means sin(x)*sin(x). Just learn it.\n\n>>$variable = new variabletype();\n\nThis is to do with object oriented programming, a big topic that I don't think you should worry about just yet.

{"text":"The Grading System: Instructor Notes\n\nThe grading scheme from the student guide is reproduced below.\nThere are three components to the student's grade.\nAs the instructor, you are responsible for the determining the\nsection component and how you will\nuse it to adjust the student's final course grade.\n\nEvaluating the section component. Since we consider cooperative\nlearning to be an essential feature of the introductory program, we\nrequire that team homework count for at least 40% of the section component.\nAside from that, it is up to you how to determine the section component\nof the grade. For example, you may choose to give weekly individual or\ngroup quizzes and/or\ndaily reading quizzes; you may choose to collect individual homework;\nyou may choose to give credit for in-class work, presentations, extra\ncredit, good team evaluations, etc. It helps to choose a system\nthat encourages study habits that you believe will contribute to\nstudent learning.\n\nInforming the students.\nIt is important that you explain your system for evaluating the section component clearly\nand carefully in your first day handout\nso that your students know how they will be evaluated.\nIt is also important to ensure that the feedback you give students on their\nsection work accurately reflects the impact it will have on their\ngrade. There are many simple ways to achieve this. One is to\ngrade section work with a median of approximately 70%. If that does\nnot suit your class, or your grading, an alternative is\nto announce the median score each time you return graded work.\n\nThe Grading System: Reproduced from the Student Guide\n\nGrades in this math course.\nAll sections of this course use the same grading guidelines\nto standardize the evaluation process.\nYour final letter grade in the course will be based on three components:\n\nThe uniform component.\n\nThe section component.\n\nThe gateway component.\n\nYour uniform component will determine your baseline letter\ngrade for the course. Your baseline grade will be adjusted by the\nsection and gateway components as described below to determine your\ncourse letter grade.\n\n1. The uniform component.\nThere are two uniform midterm exams and a uniform final exam.\nEach of these exams will be taken by all students\nin all sections at the same time, and are graded by all the instructors\nworking together.\nYour uniform component score will be determined from your scores on each exam as follows:\n\nMidterm Exam 1\n\n25% of uniform component score\n\nMidterm Exam 2\n\n35% of uniform component score\n\nFinal Exam\n\n40% of uniform component score\n\nAfter each exam, a letter grade will be assigned to your uniform component score using\na scale determined\nby the course director specifically for that exam.\nWe do not use the \"10-point scale\" often seen in high school\ncourses in which scores in the 90's get an A,\nin the 80's get a B, and so forth;\nthe level of difficulty of the exams will be considered.\nThe scale for the uniform component score will apply to all students in all sections.\n\n2. The section component. To help you learn the material,\nyou will be given a variety of reading assignments, team homework,\nindividual homework, quizzes and other in-class activities. Your instructor will decide how the section component is determined for your particular section and grade the section work to determine your section score.\nThe section component has the potential to increase your final grade above the baseline grade by one third of a letter grade (e.g., from a B+ to an A-, etc.); and, assuming that the assigned work is completed, this component cannot lower your final grade below the baseline grade by more than one third of a letter grade. So, if you are keeping up with the course and doing well\nin your section work,\nit will not only help you to do well in the uniform exams, but may also\nadd to your baseline grade. Similarly, if you\nfall behind in your section work, it may reduce your baseline grade.\n\n3. The gateway component. There will be one or two (depending\non the course you are taking)\nonline basic skills gateway test(s) which you need to pass by the\ndeadline announced in the course schedule. These routine tests are repeatable,\nand in general do not pose a problem for students who are keeping up with the course work.\nYou may practice each test online\nas many times as you like, and you may take\na test for a score as often as twice per day\nuntil the deadline. The gateway tests do not have the potential to raise your baseline\ngrade, but if they are not passed by the deadline, the gateway component will\nautomatically reduce your final grade in the course. Deadlines and grade penalties\nwill be announced in your class. All sections of your course have the same deadlines\nand penalties assigned to the gateway component.\n\nSection averages.\nCourse policy is that a section's average final letter grade cannot differ\ntoo much from that section's average baseline letter grades.\nThis means that the better your entire section does on the uniform exams,\nthe higher average letter grade your instructor can assign in your section.\nIt is therefore in your best interest to help your fellow students in\nyour section do well in this course.\nIn other words, cooperation counts!\n\nGrades at the university.\nMany students who come to the University of Michigan have to adjust\nthemselves to college grading standards.\nThe mean high school grade point average\n(recalculated using only strictly academic classes)\nof our entering students is around 3.6,\nso many of you were accustomed to getting \"straight A's\"\nin high school.\nStudents' first reaction to college grades is often,\n\"I've never gotten grades like these.\"\nHowever, a grade of 15/20 on a team homework assignment\n(which you might previously have converted to 75% - a high school C)\nmay well be a good score in a college math course.\nYour own instructor is your best source of information on\nyour progress in the class.\n\nDescribing the grading system to students. You should state\nexplicitly how you plan to arrive at semester grades - what exams will be\ngiven, approximately what weight they will have in the overall assessment of\nthe student's work, how team homework is counted, how much quizzes will\ncount, etc. The in-class component of the grade can be based on quiz\nscores, individual homework, class participation, or whatever you find\nappropriate. It is important to not to assign letter grades to the\nin-class component of the grade because the grades you award at the end of\nthe term will have to be in alignment with the performance of your class on\nthe uniform exams.\n\nAssigning final semester grades. The procedure for\ncalculating semester grades will be discussed in course meetings as the term\nprogresses.\n\nGrade books and records. Keep a good, clear record of your\ngrades in a secure place. Don't lose it. Record all scores which\nwill count towards students' grades. Many grades complaints can be\nprevented by keeping accurate records. It's easy to forget to record\ngrades before returning papers, so record everything, including all grade\nchanges, immediately. Students are very serious about their grades and\nexpect them to be treated as a strictly private matter. You do not\nneed to keep a record of students' attendance unless you choose to, however,\nyou may want to note any extended absences.\n\nComplaints about your grading. From the point of view of\nUniversity of Michigan students, a great deal hinges on getting the high\ngrades they are accustomed to getting in high school. Many first term\nfreshman have never had a grade lower than an A! They will often\nargue persistently over one or two points. This is not a sign that they\ndon't respect you. Of course, you should treat all student\ncomplaints about grading mistakes or unfairness in a serious manner.","id":"/361","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.933741569519043,"__label__0":0.06627839803695679}}

{"text":"Modern Methods in Combinatorics\n\nObjectives :\n\nFor a long time, Combinatorics was considered mainly as recreational mathematics. But in the past few decades, it has emerged as a mainstream area, with rich connections with more classical ones such as algebra, topology, geometry and probability theory. Moreover, because of its close links with computer science, Combinatorics has become a crucial scientific endeavor.\n\nBesides classical tools, like the pigeonhole principle, the inclusion-exclusion principle, the double counting argument, induction, Ramsey argument, etc., some recent tools (the probabilistic, the algebraic, the linear algebra, the analytical and the topological methods) have shown their surprising power in solving a lot of combinatorial problems (classical and new ones). For example, with a mere knowledge of the concepts of linear independence and discrete probability, beautiful connections can be made between algebra, probability, and combinatorics. These new techniques have also found striking applications in other areas of discrete mathematics and the theory of computing.\n\nDespite the beauty, the breadth and depth of results and applications of Combinatorics, research and teaching in this field are underrepresented in Argentina and South America. One of the main purposes of this school is to change this situation, by bringing a \"guided tour\" covering its most important branches, and by demonstrating its methods and power.

{"text":"It always shocks me to see high school students struggling to solve simple arithmetic problems. I happened to casually glance at the algebra homework of a ninth grader one day and saw \"3×7 =\" written next to a graphing question. Evidently, he did not immediately know the answer and was probably looking for a calculator. I later learned that this student was almost failing the algebra course, but I also could not help but wonder how much trouble the actually failing students were having. It simply seemed inefficient to me that these students were trying tolearn high school math, which is best learned with a solid foundation of fundamental concepts,when they couldn't remember the math they were supposed to have mastered six years ago.\n\nThe United States is one of the world's most technologically advanced countries, yet our mathematics program, especially at the secondary level, lags behind those of other industrialized countries [1][2]. Without a solid math background from grade school, the majority of adults in the US lack basic number sense skills – according to a poll conducted by the Center for Economic and Entrepreneurial Literacy almost 80% of adults interviewed did not understand the magnitude of a trillion [3]. These people may not completely understand the true size of the US's national debt or deficit, since for them, the figures may just seem like any big number.\n\nGiven American students' poor performance in math compared to other countries, it is unsurprising to find that the US tried a series math reforms throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Until 1960's, the predominant way of teaching math, often known as the \"traditional\" approach, emphasized memorization of basic facts and standard algorithms at the elementary level, followed by an endless array of exercises to reinforce the information. The rote memorization mindset continued through high school, and even into college; it was not uncommon to see a college calculus class that mainly focused on integration formulas and differentiation rules rather than on the fundamental meaning and purpose of derivatives and integrals [4]. Textbooks presented few problems that went beyond substituting into given algorithms, and teachers rarely explained or even mentioned the reasons and principles behind these algorithms. Consequently, math often appeared as a random collection of formulas to students. Critics have called this traditional method \"parrot math\" to stress that while students\n\neventually could reproduce most of the basic skills they were taught, they lacked any in-depth understanding of what they were learning [5].\n\nIn the 1960's, a radical change in the curriculum occurred in the US as a response to the Sputnik crisis, which spawned the Space Race against the Soviet Union. There was a general fear that the \"traditional\" math curriculum was not adequate to produce engineers that were well- grounded in advanced math. The National Science Foundation thus proposed \"new math\", which required students to learn abstract math concepts as early as elementary school, often before mastering basic computational skills. Set theory and abstract algebra, which were typically topics studied by advanced math undergraduates, made appearances in elementary school textbooks. Educators justified these new curriculum additions by claiming that students would grasp abstract math more easily in higher education if they were exposed to it earlier, although they did not make any explicit provisions for students who did not intend to further study science or engineering after high school [6].\n\nUnfortunately, it was extremely difficult for students to process the abstract concepts, especially since they had very little concrete math background to build upon. For example, without a clear understanding of basic addition facts, ideas such as the Commutative Property of Addition seemed strange and unnecessary to students. According to Piaget's theory from developmental psychology, children generally do not develop the ability to perform abstract reasoning until adolescence, so the \"new math\" essentially tried to teach concepts that most children were not cognitively ready to learn [7].\n\nAs in the traditional approach, students had weak math foundations because they did not completely understand the ideas of the \"new math\". However, the new approach was even less effective in the long-run because abstract mathematical concepts had no common applications in the real world, whereas traditional arithmetic operations were at least used in day-to-day tasks. Furthermore, the teachers themselves often did not completely grasp what they taught since they were generally not exposed to abstract mathematics in secondary school, so explaining the concepts to elementary school children was nearly impossible. Students often came out of elementary school having a vague idea about technical advanced math terminology but without the ability to compute basic multiplication facts. Ultimately, the experiment was a failure, and most schools almost immediately switched back to the traditional approach in the 1970's [6].\n\nThe traditional approach continued to be the method of choice in schools across the US for another twenty years, and before long, arguments about students' shallow understanding of math formulas again emerged. A new movement came into focus in the late 1980's when the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) introduced a different set of standards that emphasized mathematical inquiry over routine calculations. Memorization of algorithms was nearly eliminated, calculators were encouraged, and students were asked to \"discover\" their own methods of doing basic operations. This \"constructivist\" proposal gave rise to many new textbooks in the 1990's, and it became popular as several large school districts adopted these new curriculum reforms [8].\n\nUnfortunately, students and teachers were shortly faced with a new problem. To make the curriculum seem more modern, many programs encouraged heavy calculator use and did not require students to memorize basic facts. However, without adequate practice in these essential\n\ncomputational skills, students began to have trouble with even basic arithmetic, and were rarely able to do even slightly complicated problems without technology. Also, without a methodical way to add fractions, multiply two-digit numbers together, convert between percents and decimals, or carry out other similar operations, students usually ended elementary school mathematics unable to perform these essential operations. Visualizing two fractions being added, for example, was preferred over more algorithmic approaches but only works practically for simple cases; with a problem like 2/13 + 5/16, intuition quickly breaks down and one must use more general methods [9]. While calculators have made tedious arithmetic unnecessary, basic computations show up frequently in numerous subjects that students may pursue later on, and in any case, it would be highly inconvenient for people to rely on a calculator for calculations that could be quickly done mentally with adequate practice.\n\nFurthermore, perhaps as an attempt to avoid traditional methods, books commonly used variants of the standard algorithms for operations such as multiplication, division, and fraction addition. Besides being usually longer and more time-consuming, these \"new\" algorithms also misunderstood the NCTM reform's main objective: the goal was to help students understand math by finding alternatives to the traditional approach, not to replace existing algorithms. Incorporating an antiquated, inefficient \"lattice\" system for multiplying instead of the standard algorithm, for example, neither sped up the computation nor helped the student understand multiplication [10].\n\nWith all these unsuccessful changes in math programs over the past 50 years, it is not surprising that American students are behind their international counterparts in mathematics. But we rarely think about why students from other countries can learn math more thoroughly. A\n\nlengthy study done by Ginsberg and colleagues followed the math education system in Singapore, which uses a system that would be undoubtedly classified as \"traditional\", yet is consistently ranked at the top among other countries by several international tests [11]. An internationally recognized program, \"Singapore Math\", is based on the Singapore curriculum and has also found much success by the schools that have tried it [12]. By investigating the principles behind the Singapore math curriculum, the authors found numerous flaws in our own math education system that makes our methods weaker, even though they are based on the same \"traditional\" approach as those of Singapore's system [11].\n\nThe first problem in our math curriculum is its lack of specific and unified standards. Each state is free to make its own curricula, and the NCTM guidelines are vague at best; they define objectives for a range of grade levels, and therefore different states vary greatly in suggesting when basic concepts are introduced. The inconsistent structure hinders textbook companies' efforts of developing effective programs. It also becomes harder to determine the quality of new programs because the states have distinct assessment methods that influence the results of pilot- program studies. Singapore's curriculum, on the other hand, is easy to describe because it is nationalized and unified. It is therefore much easier to produce learning materials that work for all schools and to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall curriculum [11]. While a completely standardized system is less feasible in the US because of its large size and diversity, there should be more specific national standards that prevent states from producing greatly differing curricula.\n\nThe second issue with American math education lies with the textbooks' contents. Most basic math textbooks have exercises that require little thought from the student, such as one-step formula plug-ins. Students thus cannot readily apply the principles they learn to more\n\ncomplicated multi-step problems because they are not usually exposed to anything beyond their textbooks' rather simple exercises [4]. Singapore's textbooks, on the other hand, have basic drills as well, but move on to more challenging problems that apply the newly-learned concepts. By thinking through more involved questions, students master the basic procedure while developing their problem solving skills [11].\n\nA related problem is that American curricula try to cover too many concepts in a single year. Partially, this is the result of the textbook publishers' attempts to satisfy as many standards and teacher demands as possible, which ultimately stems from the lack of curriculum centralization. While Singapore's standards only require about 15 topics per grade level, some state curricula contain over 50 topics to be covered in a school year [12]. Chapters and lessons therefore tend to be shorter and less in-depth. Although exposure to a diverse range of topics can arguably be beneficial, such a wide array of topics prevents deep comprehension of any specific topic. Therefore there is no time to develop the problem solving skills needed to tackle more complicated problems [11]. Middle and high school curricula tend to be similar in terms of their lack of depth. For example, Lockhart describes precalculus as a \"senseless bouillabaisse of disconnected topics\", many of which are glossed over because they are not introduced in a meaningful context [4].\n\nAnother serious weakness is the lack of qualified teachers who teach grade school math. Singapore's teachers must be certified through stringent exams before they even enter an education program, where they are paid a salary that is comparable to that of actual teachers. In contrast, prospective US teachers have the lowest math SAT scores on average out of all college majors. It is difficult to expect that the very individuals who did not thoroughly master math in\n\nschool would be able to produce competent math students. Singapore teachers also undergo a rigorous professional development program in addition to extensive annual training in new skills. Meanwhile, US teachers only attend short workshops, despite the fact that these workshops are \"widely admitted to be ineffective for changing practice\", and teachers are not required to pass very stringent exams. In fact, the exam for certifying 6th grade teachers is easier than the exams given to Singapore sixth graders [11].\n\nTailoring the curriculum to students of different abilities, commonly called \"tracking\", is also important to ensure that all students master the material, not just the most able ones. A study showed that programs that offered more comprehensive tracking systems scored higher on math achievement tests, even after adjusting for student backgrounds [13]. Singapore addresses this problem by providing a complete alternative program for struggling students that focuses more on repetition and is taught by well-qualified teachers. By contrast, while the US provides resources for less able students, most special programs for slower math students in the US follow no real framework; students who fall behind are generally put into unofficial \"extra-help\" classes that are taught by aides who often have not earned a college degree. If all citizens are to have good basic math skills, then the needs of all students must be addressed and equal attention should be given to those who require more time or a different approach to grasp the material [11].\n\nThe solution to the problematic American curriculum is not as simple as just converting to the Singaporean model. Students that have already used American textbooks for a long time may not have all the skills necessary to progress to the next level in the Singapore curriculum, since the order and depth of topics are likely to differ. Also, since each level of the Singapore\n\ncurriculum assumes knowledge of concepts taught in previous levels, any conceptual holes in American students' knowledge would prevent thorough understanding of the new topics introduced [11]. Finally, a sudden transition to more complicated and problem-solving based questions could initially be extremely difficult to students who are more accustomed to the American textbook exercises. A gradual change would be more appropriate, but then choosing the ideal resources to facilitate this change becomes a difficult task.\n\nNewly implementing the program for first-grade students is not much more straightforward. Although students may yet not be accustomed to the \"American way\" like older students are, there are still other differences that prevent a smooth transition. As similar as the resources may be, the quality teachers will still differ between the two countries. The Singapore program presumes training in important methods used throughout the program, which in turn presumes a level of mathematical competence that may be higher than that of many US teachers. A lengthy professional program to train teachers in the US is conceivable but would be extremely expensive and require a large commitment that teachers' unions may resist [11]. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on math and science in school is vastly different between the two countries. Not only is the average school day in Asian countries longer, but also the proportion of time spent on math in school is also much greater in Asian schools. Unless more drastic reforms like lengthening the school day are considered, schools that plan to adopt a Singaporean math program must find ways to accommodate the greater required time commitment without significantly affecting the normal structure of the school day [14].\n\nAmerican schools may not be able to effectively adopt a close duplicate of the Singapore program, but they can certainly implement elements that make the Singapore curriculum\n\nsuccessful. Greater unification of standards across states would allow national textbook companies to provide more focus in their textbooks, as well as make reforms much simpler to carry out and assess. A more comprehensive track can be produced for students with greater trouble, and ideally, such classes are taught by qualified teachers. While the abilities of American teachers will not suddenly change, more substantial professional development programs rather than short, occasional workshops can improve how well they teach the new material. Furthermore, standards for future teachers should increase to ensure that the new generation of teachers are mathematically confident themselves before they try to present their knowledge of math to their students. While we do not need a population of scientists and mathematicians, all people should be able to know enough mathematics to understand how numbers are used in everyday life, such as for basic tax accounting or recipes. With these reforms in mind, we can envision a society in which statistics mean more to everyone than just vague numbers to spice up an article. Perhaps then, young students will master their multiplication tables sooner, so that rather than being stuck on basic facts, they can begin to build the critical thinking skills necessary to become mathematically literate citizens.\n\nDiscussion\n\n4 comments for \"Multiplication Tables? Dismal State of U.S. Mathematics Education\"\n\nSidney Rosenbloom\n\nThe problem is cultural. Yes, cultural.\n\nOver the past 30 or so years I have been following calls for educational (K-12) reform, math and science educational reform, saw oh so many task forces, blue ribbon commissions, expensive consultant-produced studies, thousands comments of hopeful or confused and off-target members of the public, all the way from Adm. Rickover commission to Bush's No Child Left behind etc.\n\nThis country, i.e. the middle class and its hopes for maintaining standard of living or at least preventing its further erosion, needs to have its education-industrial complex, it (in essence non-existing, globally really competitive) workforce training, some of its corporate priorities, globally proven governmental economic policies and somehow revised social contract aligned toward EXPORT-oriented business and societal mindset.\n\nAlong these lines we (again, the middle class hopes for reasonable standard of living) also radically change our value system and instead having so many students majoring in business, marketing, communication, creative writing, etc. etc. down to law believe in, appreciate, build export based job and career future for graduates of engineering, math, hard science fields.\n\nIs this going to happen?\n\nUnfortunately not, as cultural habits and preferences we share and keep so dear, along with our model of individualistic-at-any cost of capitalism (compared to say a continental/German/Scandinavian/Japanese version of capitalism) are – along with legislative bodies being bought by the top 1% will prevent any REAL, bona fide chance of such fundamental reform.\n\nObama's daughters will not also study engineering or science but might do law or something \"soft\" as the middle class will not start sending their kids to study science, math, engineering.\n\nPopular culture (TV etc.) will continue to glamorize physicians, sleek lawyers, financiers, not \"nerds\" in IT, engineering, or science.\n\nNeither party has any plan along these lines as well. One shouts about even less in taxes the other one demands traditional benefits of giving out fish instead teaching how to catch or farm one.\n\nOur pride, inertia, ideology will continue to prevent us from adopting system such as in Germany, demonstrating, year after year, that yes, it is i possible to \"spoil\" workers with high wages, give them 6 weeks of annual paid vacation, universal health care, strong labor and environmental regulations, even strong euro (yes) and have the economy make so many HIGH-VALUE-added TANGIBLE products that the rest of the world is willing to buy to have export surpluses so large that only in 2009 another export-oriented giant, 15-times larger Peoples Republic of China took over as #1 exporter.\n\nTo close: math education at K-12 levels is outrage as I know, as MS in engineering, parent of six children (with top SAT scores and successful professional careers) and someone who have kept my hopes that it will get better. Sorry to say, also feminization of our K-12 system doesn't help either while it seems to \"help\" obsessive emphasis on writing, creative/persuasive writing as we have been increasingly trying to sell each other services with increasingly \"sophisticated\" spiel, while export-oriented countries flood our market with their tangible products.\n\nAs our huge post-WW2 free ride via monopoly on printing (increasingly worthless) reserve currency will gradually come to end, chicken will come to roost in earnest. As a billionaire Sam Zell estimates, American standard of living will then drop another 25 – 30%.\n\nAgain: I do not see any force changing this cultural predisposition. We even refuse, at Reagan's \"advice\" to adopt the metric system to start with.\n\njumper\n\nFirst, thanks for the history lesson above in this article! But did you ever stop to think as we are getting closer to how the brain really works and the technology of brain scans we can do are showing the different areas of how and what the brain can do and can not do. So, my question for all of you who think it is because, \" Oh they need to try harder\" and \"they are just lazy\" or \" they just do not have the right tutor\" How sadly wrong you are and how many students fall through the cracks of the educational system that makes students fit a certain system that needed up grading years ago!\n\nSecondly, it is simple logical answer, students may have a severe math disorder that will not allow them to go as far as their school program requires them too. What I mean by math disorder it is one that neurologically can not be helped by a tutor or taking a pill either! So, you say that student shouldn't go into that program! I know a student who is in a PhD program but yet can only do 9th grade level math! This student is exceptional in all areas of the program but the math. The math isn't really needed in the program since in the \"real world\" they use computers to compute the math problems.\n\nThirdly, all of those who have gone through the educational system of the universities and jumped through their hoops will good for you and I mean it! You are the few lucky ones that can actually do it. But that is ONLY because your genetic make-up doesn't have any faulty neurological problems that will interfere with your educational endeavors. However, I bet those that have been through the educational system may have Diabetes, Cancer, Arthritis later in their late years of life and other elements that we can all see. I needed to bring this up in my post here is these individuals who have passed their educational programs feel they are \"privileged\" and that everyone else should go through the same thing they went through especially attorneys when they have to take the seditious bar exam as one example. These same individuals really have a problem with others who can not do what they just accomplished. All I can say to those who do not and have not had to deal with neurological set backs in the educational system you are very fortunate and very lucky too I might add! You are not any more special than the rest of us and all of us humans have some sort of element that we have to deal with in our life we are ALL fallibly creatures!\n\nAnd lastly, here is a list of famous people who were/are very successful without math! They all had something in common too they had some kind of math/educational disability. Here is the list: Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, George Washington, Leonardo da Vinci. Of course this list can go on and on but yet it has been talked about over and over the gifted really do not fit the molds these universities so make it to be the only way to succeed. I'm not surprised that Yale University originally wrote this article they are one of many universities that perpetuate this way of thinking. May the creative and the intelligence people rise above oppression ..like the late Steve Jobs!\n\nEducation advocate\n\nYour point is well taken. However, many children's struggle in math is the result of poor instruction and not neurological problem and if teachers cannot effectively teach math because of inadequate training and programming to children without neurological challenges that is a problem that needs to be addressed, don't you agree?\n\n Jessica Ramer\n\nUnderstanding mathematics requires both abstract reasoning and a solid knowledge base–which is developed largely through memorization.\n\nAs I have struggled to help kids learn, I am struck by *how many* kids seem unable to memorize multiplication facts–even after repeated coaching and drills. I have tried having the kids write out the tables, quizzing them orally, having them listen to CDS and even after months of work, they still fail. It is not a lack of effort on their part or mine, it is something else. Keep in mind that these kids do not have diagnosed learning disabilities, are not struggling to learn in a second language, and are not from America's most impoverished regions.\nI can't shake the gut feeling that something is seriously wrong with many of America's children, although I don't have a clue what it is. Bad diet? Too much electronic entertainment that has destroyed their ability to focus? Has cell phone radiation impaired their memory? (Don't laugh. It seems to impair learning in lab rats.)\nMaybe I was clueless as a kid, but it seems to me that 40 years ago, nearly all kids knew their multiplication tables by the end of third grade. Of course, teachers reviewed it every year to be sure, but most of us knew.\nI would appreciate comments from other teachers on this phenomenon.","id":"/384","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9621505737304688,"__label__0":0.03786948323249817}}

Figure 1\nshows a vector in R3R3, drawn as an arrow from the origin to the point xx.\nOur geometric intuition begins to fail above three dimensions, but the linear\nalgebra is completely general.\n\nFigure 1: A Vector in R3\n\nWe sometimes find it useful to sketch vectors with more than three\ndimensions in the same way as the three-dimensional vector of Figure 1. We\nthen consider each axis to represent more than one dimension, a hyperplane, in\nour n-dimensional space. We cannot show all the details of what is happening\nin n-space on a three-dimensional figure, but we can often show important\nfeatures and gain geometrical insight.\n\nVector Addition. Vectors with the same number of elements can be\nadded and subtracted in a very natural way:\n\nExample 1\n\nThe difference between the vector x=111x=111 and the\nvector y=001y=001 is the vector z=x-y=110z=x-y=110. These vectors are illustrated in Figure 2. You can see that this result is consistent with the definition of\nvector subtraction in Equation 3. You can also picture the subtraction in\nFigure 2 by mentally reversing the direction of vector yy to get -y-y and then\nadding it to xx by sliding it to the position where its tail coincides with the\nhead of vector xx. (The head is the end with the arrow.) When you slide a\nvector to a new position for adding to another vector, you must not change\nits length or direction.\n\nFigure 2: Subtraction of Vectors\n\nExercise 1\n\nCompute and plot x+yx+y and x-yx-y for each of the following\ncases:\n\nx=132,y=123x=132,y=123 ;\n\nx=-13-2,y=123x=-13-2,y=123 ;\n\nx=1-32,y=132x=1-32,y=132.\n\nScalar Product. Several different kinds of vector multiplication are\ndefined.2 We begin with the scalar product. Scalar multiplication is defined\nfor scalar aa and vector xx as\n\nax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.ax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.\n\n(4)\n\nIf |a|<1|a|<1, then the vector axax is \"shorter\" than the vector x; if |a|>1|a|>1, then the\nvector axax is '\"longer\" than x. This is illustrated for a 2-vector in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: The Scalar Product axax\n\nExercise 2\n\nCompute and plot the scalar product axax when x=11/2l/4x=11/2l/4 for\neach of the following scalars:\n\na=1;a=1;\n\na=-1;a=-1;\n\na=-1/4;a=-1/4;\n\na=2.a=2.\n\nExercise 3\n\nGiven vectors x,y,z∈Rnx,y,z∈Rn and the scalar a∈Ra∈R, prove the\nfollowing identities:\n\nFootnotes\n\nIn a formal development of linear algebra, the abstract concept of a\nvector space plays a fundamental role. We will leave such concepts to a\ncomplete course in linear algebra and introduce only the functional techniques\nnecessary to solve the problems at hand.\n\nThe division of two vectors is undefined, although three different \"divisions\" are defined","id":"/389","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9958609342575073,"__label__0":0.004159095697104931}}

{"text":"Number theory concerns itself with the properties of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ..., and related objects that arise in their study. It is tempting to assume that something as simple as the counting numbers must be rather well understood. But this is far from the case! Indeed, number theory owes much of its charm to the wealth of easily-stated problems -- possible to explain to middle-school age children -- which have so far defied solution, despite hundreds of years of effort by great mathematicians.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the foundational results, with particular attention paid to some the pathbreaking accomplishments of the 18th and 19th centuries. We will start with the basic theory (factorization into primes) before turning to Gauss's theory of congruences. The theory of congruences culminates with a proof of Gauss's Aureum Theorema (golden theorem), the law of quadratic reciprocity.\n\nMore advanced topics will be discussed later in the course. Possibilities include theorems about sums of squares, results on arithmetic functions, and results on the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nNumber theory, more than some other areas of mathematics, is largely an experimental science. It is recommended (but not required) that you download software that allows you to play with very large numbers. This is a great way to get an intuitive handle on the results we discuss.\nCommercial packages of this sort include Maple and Mathematica, but there are also free (even open source!) options, such as gp/PARI.\n\nHW assignments will contain problems required of all students, as well as more challenging problems required only for MATH 6400 students. Undergraduate participants may do these additional problems for extra credit.\n\nYou are expected to participate in class. In particular, attendance in this course is\nrequired. More than four unexcused absences may result in you receiving a WF. Keep me posted whenever you have a conflict that requires you to miss class and this should not be an issue.\n\nAll exams are in-class, closed book and closed notes.\n\nHomework will be collected in class, about once each week. Late homework will not be accepted. (If you have a need to turn in HW early, that can be arranged.) Your lowest HW score will be dropped at the end of the term.\n\nOn homework, collaboration is allowed and in fact is very much encouraged. Mathematics wouldn't be nearly as much fun if we couldn't talk about it with other people! However, copying (from a textbook or another student) and web searches are not allowed, and you must write your own final solutions independently. Keep in mind that by entering UGA, you have already agreed to abide by the UGA Honor code described in detail at <URL: \n\nIn practice, what this means that you may discuss homework problems and their solutions with your classmates, but you may not turn in a solution unless you understand it yourself. A reasonable rule of thumb is that you should be able to explain your solutions verbally to me (in all their gory detail) if requested to do so.\n\nThe withdrawal policy for this course is that if you withdraw within a week of the date the first midterm is handed back, you automatically qualify for a WP (assuming you are eligible by UGA's standards). After that point, it is at the discretion of the instructor (i.e., me) who will take your performance in the class to-date into account.\n\nSpecial accommodationsDisclaimer\n\nThis course syllabus provides a general plan for the course;\ndeviations may be necessary.","id":"/401","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.951044499874115,"__label__0":0.04897554591298103}}

However the world isn't quite a perfect sphere, and we do not always have the perfect situation. If you haven't fully study yet, the volume of material to cover in these last 24-48 hours may be too much, therefore we need a survey strategy. The following works best for computational subjects such as math, physics, chemistry or disciplines such as engineering.\n\nIf this is a college prep/standardized test, take the practice test again...\n\nThe summer months are all but gone, withered into a faded memory, like an old black and white photo. Lets hope that it was as enjoyable as it was productive. Its time to turn a new leaf in the chapter of life. New challenges, new faces, new subjects and more tests. So what did you do in the summer to keep motivated, or practice new habits?\n\nHere are my suggestions to staying motivated throughout the summer.\n* Read a new book/s.\n* Volunteer.\n* Apply the knowledge gained through the school year to a project that you wanted to do but never completed. * Research something you were interested...\n\nProof techniques are fun. They are mathematical arguments of sufficiency. The feeling you get from arguing your point logically to completion is always exhilarating. Let us put our mathematical reasoning power to the test.

Prove the following:\n\n(a) Given that the average of y and z is odd, then z is an odd integer when y is odd.\n\nWhen doing proofs it is best to do so in algebraic and generalized form. A way to represent all possible cases. Using only examples would be trivial, since we know...\n\nStudents often ask me how do Mathematicians come up with various formulas in Trigonometry, Algebra and Calculus? By method of Proofs and Derivation I would exclaim, which in my opinion is becoming a lost art. I found deriving formulas helped to seal the understanding of the concepts and theories in Math. I believe it is thus fitting as an end to our talk on polynomials, to derive the equation of the quadratic formula. We will do so by using the last method we discussed, \"Completing the Square\".\n\nIt has been a while since my last post, but as promised I am back. Recently a reader of one of my blogs commented on how helpful they were in helping her explain a concept to her HS Junior. I was indeed very glad to hear. It certainly is an encouragement to see parents, not only sign their child up for tutoring but also willing to follow through the covered material as well. Expanding on the purpose of the blog page, would be a forum board where students/parents can post short questions and have tutor respond and perhaps even have their answers rated on helpfulness.

Let y represent the number of remaining questions answered correctly. Let x represent the number of questions in total. Then;\n\nWe have reviewing the six pillars of a good study habits, skills and strategies. Now I will talk about basic study techniques in assimilating the material. There are many self help books on how to study but to be honest the approach could vary based on the individuals learning abilities, the subject content at hand as well as the intent of the study session. There is no one size fits all approach. Studying is a discipline and as such, do start early, make a commitment at the beginning of the semester/the school year. Don't wait until it is too late and be overwhelmed with...\n\nThroughout the school year I have worked with several students from diverse economic and social backgrounds. In the sessions I had the chance to observe their study habits, their improvements and successes. From these observations I gathered some interesting and useful information that I believe will help others avoid the pitfalls of bad study habits, ill preparation and last minute cramming for tests/exams. These suggestions may be self evident but if followed will contribute to improvement in learning, retention, and finally the...\n\nToday I was working with a student preparing him for the upcoming SAT in June. We came across an interesting question, which I will share with everyone here. Here is the question:\n\n(Q) There is a number 'WXYZ', (where W,X,Y and Z are integers), such that\n\nx = w + y + z [equation(1)]\n\nw = y + 1 [equation(2)]\n\nz = w – 5 [equation(3)]\n\nFind this number 'WXYZ'?\n\nIn order to solve a system of equations involving four unknowns, we need four equations (relationships).

{"text":"Description Physics The course is a 2 DVD series, 11 full You\n\nHow are the MathTutorDVD.com line of DVDs different from others? The answer is simple. Most math instruction involves a lengthy discussion of the abstract theory behind the Math before instructing the student in how to solve problems. While there are some merits to this style, in the vast majority of the cases the student quickly gets bored and frustrated by the time he or she starts to solve the problems. This DVD, in contrast, teaches all of the concepts by working fully narrated problems step-by-step, which is a much more engaging way to learn.\n\nExceptional value and affordability. MathTutorDVD.com believes in providing value for our customers. This is a 11 Hour DVD course. We could have easily split this content into many DVD courses costing the same price but instead chose to keep the cost down so that this content is affordable to all.\n\nWhat is our teaching style like? All topics on this DVD are taught by working example problems. There are no traditional lectures of background material that won't help you solve problems and improve your skills. We believe in teaching-by-doing and that is what you will receive by watching this DVD. The Equations Of Motion are explained, for example, by working many problems in step-by-step detail. We begin with the easier problems and work our way up to the harder problems. The student immediately gains confidence, does not get bored, and quickly feels like he or she can conquer the material. This method is extremely powerful and has proven itself time and again. Perhaps most importantly, problem solving skills are honed early on that will help with homework and taking exams even after watching the very first lesson.","id":"/409","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9491848349571228,"__label__0":0.050835102796554565}}
{"text":"Calculator: Calculators may come in handy during class or in\nyour homework from time to time, but I will not require you to have\none. They will be allowed on tests and homework, though on tests you\nwill find them to be of limited value. If you intend on sharing a\ncalculator with a friend, keep in mind that sharing calculators is not\npermitted on exams.\n\nIdeally, a calculator should be able to do ordinary arithmetic operations,\nas well as some additional functions like exponentiation (powers) and\nsquare roots. It need not be able to graph or be programmed.\n\nNote that cell phones and laptops are not allowed during exams, so if\nyour only calculator is a calculator program on your cell phone or\nlaptop, you will want to get a stand-alone calculator, or you will not\nhave one during the exams. In general, nothing that will permit\nelectronic communication with another student or people outside the\nroom may be used on exams.\n\nWeb page: \n\nEmail list: math102@yahoogroups.com (when you fill out your information\nyou may elect to be on this list)\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nWell, what math background are you expected to have? I realize that the\nrange of math classes taken by students in math 102 varies widely, and\nthis includes the extent to which students remember various facts.\nThis course, however, is not in sequence with the standard math sequence,\nand so mastery of past math subjects is not as relevant in this class\nas compared to what you might be used to.\n\nMost of the course is based on concepts rather than specific skills,\nthough some skill will come in handy at some points. Though these\ntimes are relatively rare, the strong reaction some students feel when\nthey do not know the relevant skils may make it loom large in their\nminds. Most of these skills, when they come up, are at the\npre-algebra and algebra level: using variables, understanding\nalgebraic expressions, and sometimes solving simple equations. It is\nassumed that students have had exposure to algebra and geometry at\nsome point, but it is not assumed that they have a strong mastery of\neither subject.\n\nIf you find you need some review on some topic like this that is used\nin class, come by my office hours or use the tutoring service mentioned\nabove.\n\nThe Idea of this class: This is most likely a very different kind\nof math class than you have ever had. Most math classes you have\nexperienced emphasize skills: how to solve a quadratic equation, or\nhow to find an unknown side in a triangle. This class will emphasize\nideas and concepts. ``How to do it'' will take a back seat to\n``Why does it work?''\n\nThis is also a course where we seek to discover math together. I'm\nnot here to tell you the answer; I'm more of a guide to help you\nexplore a mathematical concept. Through this course, I hope to show\nyou the big picture: what mathematics is all about. This is something\nthat many students don't see in high school courses, or even some\ncollege level courses. Once you see math from this point of view, I\nhope you will be able to see why mathematicians feel that mathematics\nis beautiful, or how creativity, imagination, and logical thinking can\nwork together in mathematics. I hope you will see how mathematics is\npart of what our civilization is all about: where we have been and\nwhere we are going, and why, to be a truly educated person, one must have some\nfacility with mathematics.\n\nBeyond this, we will see ten {\\em Lessons For Life} as they apply to\nmathematics. These lessons are to be found throughout the textbook, though\nthey are also at the end on p. 619 for ready reference. I hope these\n{\\em Lessons For Life}, illustrated through mathematical problem solving,\nwill serve you as you face other kinds of problems in your life.\n\nGoals: The student should develop:\n\nAn ability to translate a problem which is well-suited to mathematical\nsolutions into mathematical language;\n\nAn ability to think and reason in a structured logical manner;\n\nAn ability to use mathematical reasoning to understand problems;\n\nAn appreciation for what mathematics is all about, and what\nmathematicians do;\n\nAn idea for the logical structure of mathematics, and proof;\n\nAn appreciation for the applicability, subtlety and beauty of\nmathematics;\n\nan ability to approach problems in life analytically.\n\nObjectives: The specific objectives of this course will partly\nbe determined by the students in one of the first assignments. Students\nwill select topics from the book that are of greatest interest to them,\nand the course will be based on what topics are most popular.\n\nThe point is that these subjects are merely a vehicle to introduce the student\nto mathematics: logical thinking, quantitative sense, great and profound\nideas, and creative problem-solving. These cannot be taught in the\nabstract, but must be carried by more concrete examples, and these\nexamples will be the occasion for us to discover mathematics together.\n\nHomework: Homework will be assigned twice a week; homework\nassigned on Tuesday will be due on Thursday, and homework assigned on\nThursday will be due on Tuesday. Homework should be turned in at the\nbeginning of class.\n\nThe two lowest homework scores will be disregarded.\n\nRemember that the primary purpose of the homework is to learn the material,\nso if you miss one, or do not take it seriously, you will fall behind\nin the course material and will not do well on exams.\n\nLate assignments: No late homework is accepted. Exceptions can\nbe granted, if you must give me notice that you are going to turn in\nan assignment late at least the class before the assignment is due.\nYou must also have a good reason. These reasons will be treated on a\ncase-by-case basis. When you obtain permission to turn in an\nassignment late, we will discuss a new due date for that homework.\n\nCollaboration: You are encouraged to collaborate on all homework\nassignments, unless otherwise specified. This means you work on it\nindependently before discussing it with each other, and it means you\nmust thoroughly understand how to do the problem before writing it up.\nYou must write up your answers separately; you cannot turn in one\nhomework for more than one person, nor can you simply include\nphotocopies of other students' work. There is no limit to the size\nof a group for collaboration, although 3-5 people tends to be an efficient\nsize.\n\nYou should also use these groups to ask questions of each other to\nbetter understand the material. If you do not see each other\nfrequently, you should set up a regular time and place to meet to work\non assignments. If you do not have a group, talk to me and I can\nplace you in a group. If you do not wish to work in a group, that is\nyour prerogative but this will be a disadvantage to you.\n\nComments: You should include comments about the class at the top\nof your homework assignments. These comments can be ``This class is\ngoing too fast'', ``I like this section'', ``This is too easy/hard'',\n``Can we have more connections to music'', ``Everything's\nokay'', and so on. You will not be graded on these comments, but they\nwill affect how I teach the class, and may make the class more\nenjoyable for you.\n\nClass participation: You are expected to actively participate in\nclass. Many students view learning as a passive act, where the\nteacher takes the only active role, and the student simply listens, or\nat most takes notes. This view is not advisable in this class. Here,\nyou will need to take an active role in learning the material. {\\em\nYou} are in charge of your education, and {\\em you} should take\nresponsibility to learn the material as thoroughly as you can.\n\nThis is especially true in this class. As you will discover, this\nclass is not a lecture-style class, where I simply proclaim information\nto you and you record the information in your notes. Rather, we will\nbe engaged in mathematics discovery together.\n\nTen percent of your grade is based on my estimate of your class\nparticipation throughout the term. Mostly this is easy points: you\ndon't have to get the ``right answer''; you just have to be engaged\nin the class as evidenced by the questions and comments you make.\nIn fact, making ``wrong statements'' is a pretty important part of this\ncourse, and you will get more points for boldly guessing than for\nwaiting until you are sure you are right before speaking.\n\nAttendance: Attendance is important. The whole point of the\nclass is for us to discover mathematics together, and you cannot do\nthat if you are not here. Skipping even a single class will mean you\nwill not likely be able to do the work or know what is happening in\nthe next class period. This is not the sort of class where just\nreading the material in the book will allow you to do the work. And, of\ncourse, if you don't attend, you can't get class participation points. In\nshort, skip class at your peril.\n\nExams: There will be three midterms, and one final. Each\nmidterm counts for 16% of your grade, and the final counts for 22%.\nHomework counts for 20% and class participation for 10%. the final\nexam grade will substitute for your lowest midterm grade if this is to\nyour advantage. Borderline grades could go either way, depending on\nthe effort I see you put into the class.\n\nThere are no make up exams. If you must miss an exam due to a major\nemergency, you must make arrangements with me beforehand, and\nexceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis. If granted, your\nfinal exam score will be used to calculate the score for the missed\nexam.\n\nMidterms will be during the normal class period. Both midterms and\nfinal will occur in the normal classroom for the class. Dates for\nthese tests are as follows:\n\nMidterm 1\n\nSep 29\n\nduring class\n\nMidterm 2\n\nOct 27\n\nduring class\n\nMidterm 3\n\nDec 1\n\nduring class\n\nFinal (sec. 3)\n\nDec 13\n\n1:30 p.m.--4:00 p.m.\n\nFinal (sec. 4)\n\nDec 14\n\n1:30 p.m.--4:00 p.m.\n\nI will hold review sessions before each, at a time that is popular with the\nclass.\n\nHolidays:\n\nLabor Day\n\nSep 5\n\nConference\n\nOct 7\n\nThanksgiving\n\nNov 24--25\n\nGrading: A grade of C indicates an ability to do homework-like\nproblems, and memorization of all techniques and definitions. In\norder to receive a B, a student must demonstrate a deeper knowledge of\nthe material, being able to apply the course material to new\ncircumstances where applicable. An A student must demonstrate this\nkind of deep understanding in all of the covered topics, as well as be\nable to draw new conclusions from known facts in a logical manner, and\nmust also demonstrate persistence and dilligence. In the other\ndirection, a grade of D shows only superficial understanding of the material,\nand shows inconsistency to do straightforward problems. An F\ngrade indicates that the student has severe gaps in even superficial\nunderstanding of the material in the course.\n\nAlthough this is the philosophy, grading will be done by counting points\nreceived on each problem, as usual. But the difficulty level of the problems\nwill be arranged in order to achieve the above grading scale.\n\nChristian attitude: Although not part of the grading for this\ncourse, you are expected to approach this class with a Christian\nattitude, being willing to help your fellow classmates to understand\nthe material outside of class, being willing to be corrected by your\nfellow classmates when you see they are right, but firm in your\nconviction otherwise, being bold to ask questions without feeling\nashamed of looking foolish, encouraging one another in love, being\npatient with those who are asking questions, and preferring a grasp of\nthe material, which is enduring and becomes part of you, over a grade,\nwhich is transient, external, and shallow. You should diligently\ndevote the time you spend on this class as to the Lord. As cheating\nharms both the cheater and the rest of the class (though in different\nways), you should not cheat, nor should you provide temptations for\nothers to cheat.\n\nFor my part, I commit to approaching this class with a Christian\nattitude, viewing my role as that of a servant, being concerned first\nfor your personal, especially intellectual, development. I\nwill also seek to produce an environment of encouragement and love,\nthat fosters a sense of community and understanding. I commit to reporting\ngrades that accurately and honestly reflect the level of work done in the\nclass, as described in the paragraphs above. I also commit the time I\nspend preparing for this class as to the Lord, and I will pray for all\nindividuals in the class on a regular basis, understanding that even as I\nmay seek to educate, God provides the true transformation.","id":"/410","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9546734094619751,"__label__0":0.04534658044576645}}

{"text":". Premise: Mathematical results are expressed in a foreign language.\nThis course teaches mathematical symbolism and reasoning as if it were\nexpressed\nin a foreign language (It is!). Like other languages, the language of\nmathematics\nhas its own grammar, syntax, vocabulary, word order, synonyms,\nnegations,\nconventions, idioms, abbreviations, sentence structure, and paragraph\nstructure.\nIt has certain language features unparalleled in other languages, such\nas\nrepresentation (For example, when \"x\"\nis a dummy variable it may represent\nany real number or any numerical expression, including \"2x - 1\" and \"b\").\nThe language also includes a large component of logic. The Language\nof\nMathematics emphasizes all these features of the language (Esty,\n1992\ndiscussion\nof how to read, write, speak, and think mathematics.\n\nFortunately, mathematical sentences and paragraphs are generally\nwritten in a limited number of easily distinguishable patterns.\nStudents who are taught\nto recognize these patterns find mathematics far more comprehensible\nthan\nthose who are not. Furthermore, their abilities to solve problems and\ndo\nproofs are much enhanced (Esty and Teppo, 1994).\n\nMost examples come from algebra, functions, and set theory (not trig\nor\ncalculus), but the material is the language itself, which is essential\nfor\nall areas of mathematics. Since this material is not emphasized in any\nother\ncourse, the course level is hard to peg. Some parts look like a\n\"transition\nto advanced mathematics\" course, but, with this unique approach, many\nstudents\nwho regard themselves as \"terribly math anxious\" do very well with the\nmaterial\n(Esty and Teppo, 1994).\n\nFor a thorough explanation of how the language is essential to\nmathematics,\nsee \"Language Concepts of Mathematics\" (Esty) in FOCUS on Learning\nProblems\nin Mathematics 14.4 (Fall, 1992) pp. 31-54. For the effectiveness\nof\nthis course, see \"A General-Education Course Emphasizing Mathematical\nLanguage\nand Reasoning\" (Esty and Teppo) in FOCUS on Learning Problems in\nMathematics\n16.1 (Winter, 1994) pp. 13-35. For an article on grading in the context\nof\nthis course, see the Mathematics Teacher, 85.8 (Nov. 1992)\npp.616-618\n\"Grade assignment based on progressive improvement\" (Esty and Teppo),\nreprinted\nin Emphasis on Assessment, NCTM, 1996.\n\nBecause the organization and emphasis of the material is radically\nnew, the use of the text is not (yet) widespread. Idaho State and\nMontana State have decided that it will be necessary for Elementary\nEducation majors (It\nwas not designed for them, but they seem to have special difficulties\nwith\nabstract symbolism and this course can cure that). At Montana State it\nhas\nbeen successfully offered twelve years to general students and four\ntimes\nin the summer to secondary math teachers (who knew the procedures of\nmathematics,\nbut were not so comfortable with expressing them symbolically. A\nresearch\npaper on this will eventually appear). The course was actually designed\nwith\nfreshman math majors in mind, but, general-education students in it\nfound\nthat they could \"finally\" understand mathematics, so, when the word got\naround,\nthey became the majority of the audience.\n\nEquivalent courses: Probably no other text yields an\nequivalent course. At MSU the course number is Math 151. The level\nwould be about equivalent\nto a basic logic course -- but, it is only partly logic and, in The\nLanguage\nof Mathematics, the logic is illustrated by and selected for\nmathematics.\nThe course is more sophisticated (abstract) than Algebra II, but the\ncontent\nis not at all like \"College Algebra\" or \"Precalculus.\" Surprisingly,\nmany\nstudents who fail algebra in college (even remedial Algebra I) learn\nvery\nwell in this course if they are mature enough to actually do the\nreading\nand the work. It counts as a \"core\" course in mathematics at Montana\nState\nand Idaho State. It is somewhat above the level of \"Finite Math.\"","id":"/415","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9920719861984253,"__label__0":0.0079480716958642}}

{"text":"Math Anxiety\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMath anxiety has been defined as a feeling of tension and apprehension that arises when someone is faced with manipulating numbers and solving mathematical problems. It is not just associated with academic settings. It can show its ugly head in many ordinary life situations.\n\nIn academic settings, though, math anxiety can cause students to perform poorly on math tests, homework, and just in class generally. Very often, a studentís poor performance in a mathematics class is not just the result of a lack of knowledge. It can be tied to math anxiety as well. Someone with math anxiety is not mentally deficient. But, it can cause a student to lose focus and to lose confidence in mathematical situations, thus impacting future success in mathematical requirements.\n\nWhat causes it?\n\nMath is linear in nature. In most classes it is possible to skip one chapter and still understand the other material covered. Not so with mathematics. In this discipline a student must learn and understand a process before moving on to the next one. In other words, what you learn in Chapter One is the foundation of what will be taught in Chapter Two.\n\nMath is like a language. It has many symbols that appear foreign until you really understand what each means. You canít expect to take Spanish, for example, one week and be fluent in it the next week. It is the same in mathematics. Practice makes perfect. Doing one or two homework problems is simply not enough practice to fully grasp the concepts covered in the chapter. Do all the problems assigned. Try doing a few of the ones not assigned, as well. You can be ďfluentĒ in math if you work at it.\n\nDonít expect your college math classes to mirror those you had in high school. In a secondary setting, you went to math class every day and were saturated with the materials covered that semester. In college, however, you are expected to learn the same amount of material but in a shorter amount of time with less contact, often, with your instructor. What you had a year to learn in high school will now be covered in about 14 -16 weeks, and you are expected to fully understand it before exiting the class.\n\nRemember, math requires a different mindset. In other classes you may just need to listen, take notes, and then learn the material without really applying what you learned. In math, you will be taking what you have learned and using it to solve equations or a set of problems.\n\nDonít despair! You can do mathematics. In fact, you probably use more math daily than you realize. Balanced a checkbook lately? Doubled a recipe? If math begins to get you down, come to the Learning Assistance Center and let the tutors get you back on track. You can succeed in your math classes!\n\nHow do I know that I have Math Anxiety?\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n1. Do I become anxious and forget important concepts during a math test?\n\n2. Do I blame the instructor if I donít do well on math assignments and tests?\n\n3. Do I stop taking notes in class when I get confused?\n\n4. Am I afraid to ask questions in math class?\n\n5. Do I stop working a problem as soon as I get stuck?\n\n6. Do I feel like it is impossible for me to understand math?\n\nIf you answered ďyesĒ to several of them, then you probably do suffer from Math Anxiety.\n\nStrategies for reducing math anxiety:\n\n1. Go to every math class, without fail.\n\n2. If you must miss a class, ask the instructor if you can attend another section so you can keep up with the work.\n\n3. Make sure you read the text carefully. Donít skip over the explanations. They are there for a reason.\n\n4. Try making a vocabulary list or an outline of the material in the chapter. Math does have its own vocabulary, and you need to be familiar with it.\n\n5. Get tutoring as soon as you recognize a problem.\n\n6. Always ask your instructor if you have a question about your assignment.\n\n7. Copy everything on the board. Repeat the steps mentally and try to work the problem. Make note cards with the steps to remind yourself of the process to solve problems.\n\n8. Study as soon as possible after your class. If you wait too long, you will forget what was covered in class. Try to make consistent study times at a point during the day when you are alert and focused. Have a set start and stop time and stick to it.\n\n9. Find a place that is relatively free of distractions and make that your consistent place to study.\n\n10. Turn off the phone, TV, and music while you study. It does make a difference.\n\n11. Form a study group from your classmates. Make sure you choose students who are motivated and disciplined so you can support each other.\n\n12. Donít study for extended periods. Take a break every 30 minutes or so.\n\n13. If you are frustrated with a concept, stop. Get up. Get some fresh air. Come back to it in a few minutes when your mind is clear.\n\n14. Watch the video tapes that accompany your text. You can find them in the LAC and in the library.\n\n15. Do some math work every day.\n\n16. Review your notes and homework before you go into class. That will give you a reference point when the instructor begins the lecture for that class session.","id":"/423","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9779070615768433,"__label__0":0.022112956270575523}}

{"text":"Suggested Project Topics\n\nHere are a few ideas for project topics for final year, higher diploma, and\nMasters students. The only common thread is that they combine some\nmathematics with compuation.\n\n1. Program a LEGO Robot using Matlab\n\nThe goal will be to learn how to programme real-time systems,\nmodel-based design, and develop\nobject oriented Matlab code. These can be applied to\ncontoling LEGO Mindstrom NXT robot.\n\n2. The Singular Value Decomposition, and it's applications.\n\nThe singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important\nfactorization of a matrix with interesting applications to\na wide variety of areas such as image and signal processing,\ndata compression, computational tomography, etc..\nFor one example of the the SVD can be applied to problems involving in face\nrecognition, see Singular Value Decomposition, Eigenfaces, and 3D Reconstructions by Neil Muller, Lourenco Magaia,\nB.M. Herbst\n\nYou should consider this project if you like Linear Algebra. Some\ncomputing will be essential, but not necessarily\nanything too difficult.\n\n3. Numerical Algorithms for Parallel Computers\n\nMany classical numerical methods were designed for single-processor computers.\nExamples include Gaussian elimination\nor Numerical Integration. With the advent of parallel,\nmultiprocessor and distributed systems, there is a need to revisit\nmany of these methods and to see how they can be adapted for parallel\ncomputation.\n\nA different example is Schwarz Methods for linear boundary\nvalue problems. These have existed for over 100 years, but are being\n``rediscovered'' because they are so suitable for parallel computers\n\nA project on this topic would mainly involve programming and algorithm\ndesign. Code could be tested on some Linux computers running software to\nemulate parallel and distributed systems.\n\nThe student who does this project should like programming.\nIt would be useful\nto have studied numerical analysis.\n\n4. Simulating Small-World Networks\n\nMany networks that occur naturally have two properties: clustering and\nshort average path-lengths. This is called the small world\nphenomenon and is related to research activities in very diverse\nareas. To verify this, check a web search engine for such topics as\nSix Degrees of Separation and The Kevin Bacon Game\n\nA student working on this project will, at the very least, read\na number of articles on the topic, learn enough mathematics to\nunderstand some of the theorems and conjectures in the area, and write\nsome computer programs to simulate these networks.\n\nThe project would suit a student with interests in programming and\ngraph theory. Some knowledge is stochastic processes and Markov chains\nwould be useful.\n\n5. Topics in Numerical Analysis\n\nNumerical Analysis is the area of mathematics that is concerned\nwith the design and analysis of methods and algorithms for obtaining\nuseful solutions to mathematical problems. Two of the main sources of\nproblems are differential equations and linear algebra. The\napplications are far too numerous to mention.\n\nThe interested student should browse a few books in the library. For\nexample\nAfternotes on Numerical Analysis and\nAfternotes goes to Graduate School\n(G.W. Stewart),\nIntroduction of Numerical Analysis (Stoer and\nBulirish),\n\nDepending on the students' interests, projects may have little or no\ncomputing aspects, or may be strongly focused on computational\nproblems, or something in between.\n\n6. Some topic of mutual interest\n\nWhy not come up with your own idea? A good place to start\nwould be the Education articles in\nSIAM\nReview.

Results: Students in the\ntreatment group made significantly more use of graphical solutions than\nthe students in the control group. Males used the graphing calculator\nsignificantly more than females. The graphing calculator had a positive\neffect on the weaker math students.\n\nDescription: This study utilized two experimental\nconditions and one control condition in a senior high mathematics\nclassroom. Three classrooms used the graphing calculator throughout the\nyear with all topics in their textbook. Five classrooms used the graphing\ncalculator for only one topic for a two-month long implementation and four\nclassrooms (control group) covered the topics in the textbook without\nusing the graphing calculator Skills and concepts learned and applied\nusing the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP)\nAdvanced Algebra textbook Subjects: 306\nstudents in heterogeneous classes studying second-year algebra in four\nhigh schools.

{"text":"The Basics of Algebra\n\nBefore you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1. Without understanding the distributive property, you will find yourself completely lost in a lot of common situations that come up. The distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nExponents – Just like multiplication is repeated addition, exponents allow us to use a shorthand for repeated multiplication.\n\nPercentages – Having an even ground for comparison between different amounts is a critical skill.","id":"/455","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9973241686820984,"__label__0":0.0026958573143929243}}

{"text":"Why study calculus? Is it because you want to be a doctor, an engineer, a forensic scientist, a biologist, or a mathematician? Or is it because someone told you that it would be \"good for you\"? Well, all of those are certainly legitimate reasons. But if you aren't quite sure \"Why calculus?\" here is another reason: It is one of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind, and, even more to the point, it is easily accessible to anyone who already has studied algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.\n\nGottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton independently invented Calculus. Although the notation, terminology, and rigor may have changed or been standardized over the years, the concepts that we will study have not changed fundamentally since the work of the co-inventors in the 17th century.\n\nWe will begin Calculus with the study of Rates of Change and what are called derivatives. Rates of Change are all around us. For example, velocity is the rate of change of distance with respect to time; and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. So, we experience derivatives every time we ride in a car, or fly in an airplane. Calculus can also be used to compute areas and volumes of odd shapes with what are known as integrals. Thus, calculus has a place in architecture too.\n\nThat calculus is important in real-world applications is not in dispute. In fact, there are so many applications of calculus that studying it really is \"good for you.\" Besides engaging in a worthwhile intellectual endeavor, you will be helping to keep your future career options open. That, from a practical point of view, is not a bad reason at all.\n\nMoreover, studying calculus can be a lot of fun, but we will let you be the judge of that.\n\nHow to study calculus. Calculus has a lot of rules. We admit it! Find the derivative of this function, or the integral of that. However, you should train yourself to keep the rules in perspective: Always put the concepts first. When you study a given calculus concept, ask yourself three questions:\n\nWhat is the picture (a graph or sketch) that I should have in mind?\n\nWhat is the theorem or formula that gives a statement of the concept?\n\nDo I know how to use the concept in different situations and with different numbers?\n\nThe above is what we might call \"high-level thinking.\" It provides a way for you to stay oriented, to know what you are learning, and for what purpose. The rest is in the details, important though they are. The combined process is a lot like using a map to hike through the woods. Yes, you have to look at individual trees and their proximity to local landmarks to find your way, but you always want to keep the map and a compass handy to give an overview of the whole trip. So it goes with the study of calculus concepts. Always know where you are going, the direction to take to get there, and how to accomplish the task. The proof, though, is in getting there!\n\nPractice, practice, practice. In the end, there is no other way. You cannot learn calculus by reading about it. You have to take a pencil and paper and work problems. Learning calculus, or mathematics in general, is a participatory activity. You have to do it to learn it, to make it your own.\n\nUsing Calculus on Demand to study calculus.\n\nThe Index page of COD (i.e., the page you see when you go to the web site with your Browser) has a picture of a Leibniz Wheel in the upper left-hand corner. Click on the Leibniz Wheel to find out what it is, and how it represents our philosophy of combining theory with practice in the study of calculus in a computing environment.\n\nCOD is a Calculus I course that gives an introduction to differential and integral Calculus that comprises roughly to the AB part of the AP exam. You will find the topics listed in the green left-hand sidebar of the COD index page. Clicking on a topic will take you to the Lecture-page on that topic.\n\nLecture pages: All the Lecture pages have the same layout. There is a short statement of the main thrust of the lecture, followed by these items:\n\nQuick Question: This section is intended to get you thinking about the topic. Sometimes you can answer this question before studying the material of the Lecture, other times not. If you have answered the question, you can check its correctness by clicking Answer. If you don't think you know the answer to the Quick Question, it is better to wait and try the question again after you have studied the Textbook section, which should allow you to answer the question. As before you then can check the correctness of your answer by clicking Answer.\n\nTextbook: Here you will find a link to on-line material from a textbook. At present, we are using the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. When you click on the topic in the Textbook section of the Lecture page, you will get a list of the material from the sections of this book corresponding to the COD topics. If you click a topic, you will launch an Acrobat Reader pdf file that will display the text on-line. You can open the link for the Lecture you are working on or for any other topic if there is something you have forgotten and want to review, or if you want to peek ahead. The textbook material will open in a separate window so that you can leave it open on your desktop while you are going through the rest of the lecture.\n\nToday's Homework: The link here will take you to the WeBWorK login page. If you do not have a password, you can sign in as a practice user with practice1 as both the user name and password. If \"practice1\" is in use, try practice2, or practice3, etc. until you find one that is not in use. After logging in, you will see a page that has the option to \"Begin Problem Sets.\" After selecting it, you will see a list of homework sets that are listed by day. For example, the homework set \"Setm3f02day04\" corresponds to the homework for COD Lecture 4. Similarly, \"Setm3f02day13\" is the homework for COD Lecture 13. Ignore the fact that the sets all say \"CLOSED;\" this just means that the answers are available, and that WeBWorK will not retain your answer once you log off. However, by choosing a problem set and \"getting a problem\" you may input your answers and WeBWorK will tell you if you are right or wrong. You could also get a copy of the problem set (in pdf).\n\nYou may not want to do the homework until you have looked at some Examples and tried the on-line Quiz. This will be true if you are studying the material for the first time. In that case, you should look at the Examples, take the Quiz, and review the Textbook material as necessary before turning to the homework exercises. For those students who have seen the material before, there is nothing wrong with going directly to the homework. You can always come back later to the examples and quiz as needed.\n\nQuiz\n\n: The quiz consists of a set of problems that come up in their own window. You can work out the answers on paper and check them by looking at the COD answers on-line.\n\nExamples: Here you can find examples of problems and their step-by-step solutions on-line.\n\nApplets: These carry out little computer programs that illustrate a calculus idea or provide a tool to implement a calculus procedure. Look at and experiment with them. They are meant to help you learn the material better, or to function much like advanced calculators. Don't be shy. Have fun with them.\n\nVideos: Click on a video to see a calculus problem being worked out by real people. Be on the lookout for Dartmouth graduate students, faculty, and undergraduates. So far, there have been no lucrative film contracts in the offing, but who knows? How long did it take Matt Damon to be discovered?\n\nLecture-page sidebar: The green sidebar on the left contains links to several resources. First, there is a link to the Math 3 Course Home Page. Math 3 is the Dartmouth course for which COD is the on-line version. The Math 3 Home Page talks about all of the issues relevant to a student taking the course on campus in that particular term. We thought you might be interested. The next link on the COD sidebar gives the Syllabus for that offering of Math 3. The day-by-day syllabus corresponds to the layout of the Lectures in COD. Be careful, though, and don't be misled. If you are studying calculus on your own it may take more than one day to master the material of a given lecture: having a real live teacher does make a difference!\n\nThere is also a link to past Math 3 exams (covering Lectures 1-10, 11-19; and the course final). This link is called Practice Exams and should be used as such to test your understanding of blocks of the COD Lectures. There is also a Textbook Home Page link to the home page of the book Principles of Calculus Modeling: An Interactive Approach by Donald Kreider and Dwight Lahr. Here you will find section-pages that give links to calculus resources on the World Wide Web. And finally, there is a link to the Post a Comment page that we discuss below.\n\nWhat do you do if you have a problem? If you are studying calculus in a classroom setting, you can talk to other students or to the teacher. However, if you are studying on your own, you can Post a Comment using the bottom link on the green sidebar of a lecture-page. There you can communicate with other students who also are studying calculus on-line. You could either state your problem and ask for help, or you may find that someone has already answered that or a similar question. You may even find questions that you can answer for other students. We encourage you to look at the Post a Comment section of COD on a regular basis.","id":"/472","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9779265522956848,"__label__0":0.022093530744314194}}

{"text":"Undergraduate linear algebra is both beautiful and replete with real world applications and connections to the rest of mathematics. The purpose of the present volume is to enrich the understanding of linear algebra for a wide audience by placing a broad collection of short items in the hands of teachers, students, and others who enjoy the subject. Because undergraduate linear algebra is so fundamental to the mathematics curriculum, it is often taught by non-specialists and specialists alike. \"Linear Algebra Gems\" offers to all teachers clever ways in which core ideas can be presented to their students.\n\nMost articles are accessible to those with modest preparation in linear algebra, including beginning students. However, many items will also contain pleasant surprises even to those well-versed in the subject. The editors have combed through the literature, and have selected from original submissions, to find expository articles and problems to enrich the reader's understanding. The seventy-three articles selected are organized into nine sections, with over 120 problems grouped into subject categories as a tenth section.\n\nContributors to the volume include experts in the field and long-time teachers of linear algebra. The book was prepared as part of a broad contract with the National Science Foundation to improve undergraduate linear algebra education. The editors hope that many readers will find enjoyment from this collection. [via]\n\nMore editions of Linear Algebra Gems: Assets for Undergraduate Mathematics:\n\nLinear algebra and matrix theory have long been fundamental tools in mathematical disciplines as well as fertile fields for research. In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topicsBuilding on the foundations of its predecessor volume, Matrix Analysis, this book treats in detail several topics with important applications and of special mathematical interest in matrix theory not included in the previous text. These topics include the field of values, stable matrices and inertia, singular values, matrix equations and Kronecker products, Hadamard products, and matrices and functions. The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. The book should be welcomed by graduate students and researchers in a variety of mathematical fields both as an advanced text and as a modern reference work.

{"text":"Main menu\n\nBoletin UAL: Online Mathematical Project\n\nSubmitted by Boletin on Sun, 02/19/2012 - 10:54\n\nOptional Abstract:\n\nThe project we present here is an online free journal on the spreading of Mathematics ( mainly addressed to secondary school students, although also appropriate for a broader audience. It is a local action of the University of Almería (Spain) to promote Mathematics among secondary school students and to strengthen relationships with their Math teachers. Our leitmotiv is to provide a closer, more objective, real and positive image of mathematics and help to improve its perception and assessment. This project also includes visits to secondary schools, where the prize of the journal's mathematical contest is awarded to the winner and talks on popularization of Maths are delivered. The journal, created in 2007, is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course, and its length is around 20-25 pages. More than 30 persons are involved in its edition. Last year we had around 115,000 visits and more than 45,000 downloads.\n\nIn Spain, it is well known that secondary school students' motivation to study Science (especially Mathematics) is not very strong. This is a common problem to almost all Europe. Spanish and Andalusian governments have general policies on education to promote the study of Science. They are necessary and convenient. However, we think that local actions in the students' environment, which supplement these policies, are also needed.\nFor this reason, five years ago we founded at the University of Almería an online free journal called Boletín de la Titulación de Matemáticas de la UAL ( mainly addressed to those students. Our intention is to stimulate their interest in mathematics, to develop their mathematical skills, to complement their background, and to improve their perception and assessment of mathematics. Many aspects, usually out of the syllabus, are treated to provide a closer, more real and positive image of mathematics. Another aim is to encourage a closer contact between secondary schools and our university. Although these are our main goals, we do not discard a broader audience and often include articles appropriate for a general public.\nIt is not a customary journal or gazette but a virtual place where secondary school students and teachers, undergraduate students and university professors can write about their experience with Mathematics in their classes, read and write short articles on mathematical spreading, participate in quizzes, see real life applications of Mathematics, etc. We do not know of a similar project in Spain, and our journal is now known all over the country.\nBoletín is available in a well-known free format from our web page (pdf file), and elaborated with the free software LATEX, commonly used in the scientific world.\nThis project is a joint experience which is carried out by people working or studying in different levels of the Spanish educational system. There are professors and students from our university and teachers from secondary schools. The secondary school students are, as said, the main target of this project, and they can participate through the mathematical contest that we pose. There exists a closer contact later in the prize award ceremony at the winner's secondary school. In such ceremonies, apart from awarding the prize, we give a talk on Maths and inform about our university degree in Maths, thus strengthening relationships with the winner's secondary school and their Math teachers. No doubt, the contest is the way that leads us from our virtual site to the live contact with the most important part of our audience. Regarding our undergraduate students, they have their own section in the journal, called \"Territorio Estudiante\" (Student Area).\nThe journal is published in Spanish 3 times an academic course (October, January and April). Its length is around 20-25 pages and papers published must be short and suitable for a secondary school level. It is divided into 5 main sections, each of which has several subsections:\n\nInterviews, mathematical activities, and news.\n\nFrom Secondary School to University, containing teaching experiences, learning Maths in a foreign language, solutions to the university entrance exam Maths problems, etc.\n\nA mathematical contest for secondary school students.\n\nMathematical spreading, including short articles about History of Mathematics, applications of Mathematics, Women and Mathematics, Culture and Mathematics, etc. Books and web pages reviews about Mathematics popularization appear here as well. Mathematical quotations and puzzles are also included.\n\nStudent area, made itself by our undergraduate students and where, among other things, they speak about their experiences with mathematical studies and activities and interview Erasmus students and alumni.\n\nThe editorial committee consists of 3 main editors and 29 section editors, composed by professors of the University of Almería and teachers from secondary schools of our province, and 4 undergraduate students in charge of the student area. Although our goal is acting in our local environment, since we use a global tool such as the Internet, we usually receive experiences and articles from people from other regions, which is an indicator that Boletín is known out of our province. For example, the Spanish Royal Mathematical Society (RSME) in its nice site DivulgaMAT ( includes a link with the summaries of the Boletín issues.\nTo spread our project, apart from our web site and visits to secondary schools, we announce the publication of a new issue in the RSME electronic bulletin, collaborate with the local press, use Facebook (group Almería Matemática with more than a hundred members), give out merchandising (pens with our logo, mathematical T-shirts, usb memories, etc.) and publicize it among our guest professors and at the universities we visit for research purposes.\nSeveral facts allow us to claim that this project has a very positive effect. We are very interested in knowing if our efforts to bring the Mathematics closer to young people and teachers in schools are useful. Among the methods to know this we use:\n\nAppearance in the local newspapers to achieve more social relevance (see the additional documentation).\n\nNumber of visits that we pay to secondary schools and feedback from them since this quantity points out the interest that the Boletín arouses.\n\nRecognition by the local academic authorities. In 2011, we received the award for Excellence in Teaching Innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, with the invaluable help of our journal we have set up a reliable atmosphere between professors from our university and teachers from secondary schools in our region of influence. This has permitted to develop other activities jointly such as meetings about mathematical education (I Jornada del Profesorado de Almería,  or the group Almería Matemática in Facebook. Our Maths students at the university benefited from this and there is a growing interest among secondary school students in studying the degree in Mathematics at the University of Almería.","id":"/480","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9202480316162109,"__label__0":0.0797719731926918}}

This historical module excerpt illustrates the difficulties Abel and Galois had in breaking into the mathematical circles of their time. \"Niels Henrik Abel, at the age of sixteen, proved that a general formula for solving a quintic (fifth degree) polynomial did not exist…. However, since he was largely self taught, leading mathematicians in Paris, such as Cauchy, largely ignored him… Evariste Galois had equally important discoveries. At sixteen, Galois had the desire to enter the most prestigious engineering school of the day, the École Polytechnique… [W]hen Galois submitted a paper to the school as part of the admission process, Cauchy lost the paper. He attended another school for the purpose of training to become a teacher. However, he kept his mathematical studies up and submitted a second paper to the École Polytechnique. This paper also appears to have been lost.\" (Hagerty and Smith, 2006).\n\nPolynomials: Looks at theoretical methods to help find zeros of polynomials. The module looks at Horner's method and how information traveled in eras prior to modern-day technology. It includes a discussion of the difficulty of crediting the correct civilization with the development of a topic as it is believed that Horner did not develop the method credited to him; in fact, the Ancient Chinese knew of this method (Eves, 1992).\n\nTechnology: Looks at methods to use technology to find zeros of polynomials, and discusses the rapid changes in technology. The goal is to have the students take a look at when the Internet was developed and realize that instant messages were not always possible.

{"text":"Cover\n\nTitle Page\n\nCopyright\n\nPREFACE\n\nLinear algebra is now included in the undergraduate curriculum of\nmost universities. It is generally recognized that this branch of\nalgebra, being less abstract and directly motivated by geometry, is\neasier to understand than some other branches and that because of the\nwide applications it should be taught as early as possible. The ...\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER I. LINEAR SPACE\n\nIn the euclidean plane E, we choose a fixed point 0 as the origin,\nand consider the set X of arrows or vectors in E with the common\ninitial point 0 . A vector a in E with initial point 0 and endpoint A is\nby definition the ordered pair (O, A ) of points. The vector a = ( 0 , A)\ncan be regarded as a graphical representation of a force acting at the ...\n\nCHAPTER II. LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS\n\nAt the beginning of the last chapter, we gave a brief description of\nabstract algebra as the mathematical theory of algebraic systems and,\nin particular, linear algebra as the mathematical theory of linear\nspaces. These descriptions are incomplete, for we naturally want to\nfind relations among the algebraic systems in question. In other ...\n\nCHAPTER III. AFFINE GEOMETRY\n\nTo define the basic notions of geometry, we can follow the so\ncalled synthetic approach by postulating geometric objects (e.g.\npoints, lines and planes) and geometric relations (e.g. incidence and\nbetweenness) as primitive undefined concepts and proceed to build\nup the geometry from a number of axioms which are postulated to ...\n\nCHAPTER IV. PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY\n\nIn order to have a concise theory without all these awkward exceptions,\nwe can - and this is a crucial step towards projective\ngeometry - extend the plane A (and similarly the plane A') by the\nadjunction of a set of new points called points at infinity. More\nprecisely, we understand by a point at infinity of A the direction ...\n\nCHAPTER V. MATRICES\n\nThis therefore suggests the notion of a matrix as a doubly indexed\nfamily of scalars. Matrices are one of the most important tools in the\nstudy of linear transformations on finite-dimensional linear spaces.\nHowever, we need not overestimate their importance in the theory of\nlinear algebra since the matrices play for the linear transformations ...\n\nCHAPTER VI. MULTILINEAR FORMS\n\nLinear transformations studied in Chapter II are, by definition,\nvector-valued functions of one vector variable satisfying a certain\nalgebraic requirement called linearity. When we try to impose similar\nconditions on vector-valued functions of two (or more) vector\nvariables, two different points of view are open to us. To be ...\n\nCHAPTER VII. EIGENVALUES\n\nGiven a single endomorphism o of a finite-dimensional linear\nspace X, it is desirable to have a base of X relative to which the\nmatrix of o takes up a form as simple as possible. We shall see in this\nchapter that some endomorphisms can be represented (relative to\ncertain bases) by matrices of diagonal form; while for every ...\n\nCHAPTER VIII. INNER PRODUCT SPACES\n\nWe began in Chapter I by considering certain properties of vectors\nin the ordinary plane. Then we used the set V2 of all such vectors\ntogether with the usual addition and multiplication as a prototype\nlinear space to define general linear spaces. So far we have entirely\nneglected the metric aspect of the linear space V2 ; this means that","id":"/498","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.993488073348999,"__label__0":0.006531922146677971}}

{"text":"Steps to Achieving the Highest Levels of Mathematics\n\nOverview\n\nBecause of the sequential nature of learning mathematics, course placement is based on student effort, teacher recommendation, standardized test scores, and parent/student input. To remain on grade-level, students need to participate in three math credits during their freshman and sophomore years, especially to complete Algebra I, Parts I and II and Euclidean Geometry. Students will need a graphing calculator; all are encouraged to use the Texas Instruments series. The TI-81-86 graphing series is recommended for Algebra I pt. I, and beyond. All students are strongly encouraged to study mathematics beyond tenth grade at the most challenging levels.\n\nMathematics: Meeting New Challenges Grade 7\n\nMathematics in grade seven continues to develop the topics learned in elementary school, with an emphasis on problem solving using algebraic skills. Students review basic understanding of fractions and decimals; a sound grasp of multiplication facts is a must. Students participate in the American Mathematics Competition Examination, as well as taking the NECAP and MAP assessments. Based on NECAP scores, districts assessments, and teacher recommendation, students can enroll in Algebra I: Part 1 and earn high school credit.\n\nPre-algebra Grade 8\n\nQualifying students may participate in this course in grade 7. Topics covered include numbers and operations, powers and exponents, order of operations, scientific notation, prime factorization, rational and irrational numbers, ratios, and percent of change. In algebra, students identify inverse operations, distributive property, graphing equations, and inequalities, scale models, identify congruent and similar figures, transformations, Pythagorean Theorem, ratios, circles, and classify and sketch solids. In data analysis and probability, students find outcomes and odds, and draft appropriate data displays. Problem-solving is integrated throughout the course. District assessments include NECAP and MAP. The eighth grade participates in the American Mathematics Competition-8.\n\nAlgebra I: Part I 1 credit Grades 8-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Pre-algebra and teacher recommendation\n\nThis course develops ability in the real number system. Combining like terms and balancing equations leads to expertise in solving and graphing linear functions. Students use graphing calculators extensively as an aid in learning about slope as a rate of change and in solving linear systems. Problem solving skills are integrated into all topics and students complete the first seven chapters of the text, Algebra I (McDougall, Littell-Larson Ed.)\n\nAlgebra I: Part II 1 credit Grades 9-12 Math credit.\n\nPrerequisite(s): Algebra I: Part I and teacher recommendation\n\nThis course extends a student's ability to work with algebraic expressions and functions. The rules for exponents are learned, leading students to more sophisticated equations (quadratic, exponential, radical) and graphs (parabolas, exponentials, hyperbolas). Graphing calculators are used extensively to understand and learn graphing translations. Factoring and division techniques are developed in order to solve higher degree equations. Permutations and combinations are taught as part of more advanced probability activities.\n\nEuclidean Geometry 1 credit Grades 9-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Algebra 1: Part I\n\nStudents demonstrate high level reasoning by writing proofs and solving problems dealing with points, lines, angles, triangles, quadrilaterals, circles, and other shapes. Students study area, perimeter, and volume and the connections between the three dimensions. Students will complete a variety of two- and three-dimensional hands-on projects. The texts used are Geometry (Houghton, Mifflin) and Flatland (Abbott).\n\nAlgebra II 1 credit Grades 10-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Algebra I: Part II\n\nThis course extends the study of previous algebra courses and assumes a strong working knowledge of those topics. It encompasses the study of functions including logarithmic functions, irrational and complex numbers, polynomial equations, analytic geometry, conic sections, and series and sequences. The text is Algebra II (McDougall, Littell).\n\nPre-calculus 1 credit Grades 11-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Algebra II and Geometry\n\nThis course completes the preparation for college-level calculus. Students develop skills in advanced function analysis and the use of these functions for modeling applications. Concepts in trigonometry are extended to include circular and inverse functions. Analytic trigonometry is studied to apply in vector, parametric, and polar applications. Conic sections are reviewed and extended as are topics in discrete mathematics. Students use graphing calculators on a daily basis.\n\nAP Calculus 1½ credits Grades 11-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Pre-calculus and teacher recommendation\n\nThis full-year course prepares students for The College Board Advanced Placement Examination, level AB, which is equivalent to one semester of college calculus. This course includes a brief review of the algebraic and transcendental functions and a study of topics in the differential and integral calculus. Students taking this class participate in the AP Calculus exam. The primary text is Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic, 3rd ed. (Finney, Demana, Waits, Kennedy).\n\nMath Workshop 1 credit Grades 9-10 Elective credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Teacher recommendation\n\nThis class is designed to prepare a student for algebra at the high school level. The course is a review of necessary and fundamental arithmetic skills. Students learn to cope with the frustrations of mathematics and pursue a variety of strategies to unlock the principles and procedures of mathematics. Organizational and study skills are emphasized in this elective course.\n\nIntroductory Algebra 1 credit Grades 9-10 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Teacher recommendation\n\nIn this course, students investigate algebra using different methods and strategies to solve problems. Algebraic concepts are applied to real-world situations. Students learn the language of algebra to solve simple equations, work with algebraic expressions, and communicate mathematical thinking to others. Students use graphing and other data analysis to organize and understand mathematics. The text used is Algebra: Concepts and Applications (Glencoe McGraw-Hill).\n\nDiscovering Geometry 1 credit Grades 10-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Algebra I: Part I or Introductory Algebra\n\nThis course is an introduction to the practical aspects of geometry. Topics include the properties of angles, triangles, quadrilaterals, circles and other two-dimensional shapes, area, perimeter, volume, ratio and proportion, geometric construction, and right angle trigonometry. Students complete a variety of two- and three-dimensional hands-on projects. The text used is Discovering Geometry: An Intuitive Approach (Key Curriculum).\n\nConsumer Math 1 credit Grades 11-12 Math credit\n\nPrerequisite(s): Teacher recommendation\n\nTopics in this course relate to problems that consumers face in everyday life.

A matrix M can be multiplied on the right by another matrix T only if T has the same number of rows as M has columns, and the result will have as many rows as M and as many columns as T. The entry of M T appearing in row i and column j is the sum of the pairwise products of the entries in row i of M and column j of T. In other words, if M is an n by m matrix, T must be an m by l matrix, and\n\nNotice that this operation is not, in general, commutative. A matrix that has the same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix, and these are particularly interesting as they can be added and multiplied, and the results will have the same dimensions.

{"text":"[via]\n\nOne of the most commonly asked questions in a mathematics classroom is, \"Will I ever use this stuff in real life?\" Some teachers can give a good, convincing answer; others hem and haw and stare at the floor. The real response to the question should be, \"Yes, you will, because algebra gives you power\" the power to help your children with their math homework, the power to manage your finances, the power to be successful in your career (especially if you have to manage the company budget). The list goes on.\n\nAlgebra is a system of mathematical symbols and rules that are universally understood, no matter what the spoken language. Algebra provides a clear, methodical process that can be followed from beginning to end to solve complex problems. There's no doubt that algebra can be easy to some while extremely challenging to others. For those of you who are challenged by working with numbers, Algebra I For Dummies can provide the help you need.\n\nThis easy-to-understand reference not only explains algebra in terms you can understand, but it also gives you the necessary tools to solve complex problems. But rest assured, this book is not about memorizing a bunch of meaningless steps; you find out the whys behind algebra to increase your understanding of how algebra works.\n\nIn Algebra I For Dummies, you'll discover the following topics and more:\n\nAll about numbers rational and irrational, variables, and positive and negative\n\nFiguring out fractions and decimals\n\nExplaining exponents and radicals\n\nSolving linear and quadratic equations\n\nUnderstanding formulas and solving story problems\n\nHaving fun with graphs\n\nTop Ten lists on common algebraic errors, factoring tips, and divisibility rules.\n\nNo matter if you're 16 years old or 60 years old; no matter if you're learning algebra for the first time or need a quick refresher course; no matter if you're cramming for an algebra test, helping your kid with his or her homework, or coming up with next year's company budget, Algebra I For Dummies can give you the tools you need to succeed [via]\n\nVolume I of a pair of classic texts and standard references for a generation this book is the work of an expert algebraist who taught at Yale for two decades. Volume I covers all undergraduate topics, including groups, rings, modules, Galois theory, polynomials, linear algebra, and associative algebra. 1985 edition.\n\nAn array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. It then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterised by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including new chapters on topics of active interest: symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories, and the coherence theorems for them, as well as 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. [via]\n\n. The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics.\n\nHermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. In The Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, \"My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.\"\n\nWeyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to which The Classical Groups has proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton, Algebraic Theory of Numbers inaugurated the Annals of Mathematics Studies book series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics.\n\nThis text provides a supportive environment to help students successfully learn the content of a standard algebra course. By incorporating interactive learning techniques, the Aufmann team helps students to better understand concepts, focus their studying habits, and obtain greater mathematical success. [via]\n\nThis is a comprehensive review of commutative algebra, from localization and primary decomposition through dimension theory, homological methods, free resolutions and duality, emphasizing the origins of the ideas and their connections with other parts of mathematics. The book gives a concise treatment of Grobner basis theory and the constructive methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that flow from it. Many exercises included. [via]\n\nMore editions of Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry:\n\nThis textbook for advanced courses in group theory focuses on finite groups, with emphasis on the idea of group actions. Early chapters identify important themes and establish the notation used throughout the book, and subsequent chapters explore the normal and arithmetical structures of groups as well as applications. Includes 679 exercises. 1978 edition.\n\nPresents the fundamentals of linear algebra in the clearest possible way, examining basic ideas by means of computational examples and geometrical interpretation. This substantial revision includes greater focus on relationships between concepts, smoother transition to abstraction, early exposure to linear transformations and eigenvalues, more emphasize on visualization, new material on least squares and QR-decomposition and a greater number of proofs. Exercise sets begin with routine drill problems, progress to problems with more substance and conclude with theoretical problems. [via]\n\nNoted for its expository style and clarity of presentation this substantial revision reflects a new generation of students' changing needs. Proceeds from familiar concepts to the unfamiliar, from the concrete to the abstract. Features a wide variety of interesting contemporary applications which have been extensively revised and updated. Includes new material on least squares and QR-decomposition and greater emphasis on visualization. [via]\n\nFrom the reviews: \"The theory is systematically developed by the axiomatic method that has, since von Neumann, dominated the general approach to linear functional analysis and that achieves here a high degree of lucidity and clarity....The book contains about 350 well placed and instructive problems, which cover a considerable part of the subject. All in all this is an excellent work, of equally high value for both student and teacher.\" --ZENTRALBLATT FÜR MATHEMATIK [via]\n\nConsidered a classic by many, A First Course in Abstract Algebra is an in-depth, introduction to abstract algebra. Focused on groups, rings and fields, this text gives students a firm foundation for more specialized work by emphasizing an understanding of the nature of algebraic structures. The sixth edition of this text continues the tradition of teaching in a classical manner while integrating field theory and a revised Chapter Zero. New exercises were written, and previous exercises were revised and modified. [via]\n\nGalois theory is a fascinating mixture of classical and modern mathematics, and in fact provided much of the seed from which abstract algebra has grown. It is a showpiece of mathematical unification and of \"technology transfer\" to a range of modern applications.\n\nGalois Theory, Second Edition is a revision of a well-established and popular text. The author's treatment is rigorous, but motivated by discussion and examples. He further lightens the study with entertaining historical notes - including a detailed description of Évariste Galois' turbulent life. The application of the Galois group to the quintic equation stands as a central theme of the book. Other topics include the problems of trisecting the angle, duplicating the cube, squaring the circle, solving cubic and quartic equations, and the construction of regular polygons\n\nFor this edition, the author added an introductory overview, a chapter on the calculation of Galois groups, further clarification of proofs, extra motivating examples, and modified exercises. Photographs from Galois' manuscripts and other illustrations enhance the engaging historical context offered in the first edition.\n\nWritten in a lively, highly readable style while sacrificing nothing to mathematical rigor, Galois Theory remains accessible to intermediate undergraduate students and an outstanding introduction to some of the intriguing concepts of abstract algebra. [via]\n\nThe Study Guide is based on David Lay's many years in the classroom, and has been updated so students can take full advantage of the new projects and data in the Updated Second Edition of the text. This guide gives the worked-out solutions to model problems that correspond with exercises in the text, along with study tips, hints to students, instructions for using MATLAB along with the text, additional MATLAB exercises, and expanded coverage of some text material. Maple and Mathematica appendices have been added, and the TI appendix has been updated to include coverage of the TI-86. [via]\n\nLinear algebra is relatively easy for students during the early stages of the course, when the material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. But when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a \"brick wall.\". Finally, when discussed in the abstract, these concepts are more accessible. Students' conceptual understanding is reinforced through True/False questions, practice problems, and the use of technology. David Lay changed the face of linear algebra with the execution of this philosophy, and continues his quest to improve the way linear algebra is taught with the new Updated Second Edition. With this update, he builds on this philosophy through increased visualization in the text, vastly enhanced technology support, and an extensive instructor support package. He has added additional figures to the text to help students visualize abstract concepts at key points in the course. A new dedicated CD and Website further enhance the course materials by providing additional support to help students gain command of difficult concepts. The CD, included in the back of the book, contains a wealth of new materials, with a registration coupon allowing access to a password-protected Website. These new materials are tied directly to the text, providing a comprehensive package for teaching and learning linear algebra. [via]\n\nThis text for a second course in linear algebra, aimed at math majors and graduates, adopts a novel approach by banishing determinants to the end of the book and focusing on understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text. [via]\n\nA student-oriented approach to linear algebra, now in its Second Edition\n\nThis introductory-level linear algebra text is for students who require a clear understanding of key algebraic concepts and their applications in such fields as science, engineering, and computer science. The text utilizes a parallel structure that introduces abstract concepts such as linear transformations, eigenvalues, vector spaces, and orthogonality in tandem with computational skills, thereby demonstrating clear and immediate relations between theory and application.\n\nIntroducing finite-dimensional representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras, this example-oriented book works from representation theory of finite groups, through Lie groups and Lie algrbras to the finite dimensional representations of the classical groups.

{"text":"Calculus ABCs:\n\nAbsolutely Basic Competency\n\nIntroduction\n\nFreshman Calculus covers a wide range of topics. As students struggle to\nlearn concepts, techniques, and applications, it is possible for certain basic\nskills to get lost in the shuffle. To ensure that students who pass freshman\ncalculus can do the basics, the Department of Mathematics has identified\nstandards for \"Absolutely Basic Competency\"--what we call the Calculus\nABCs. There are separate standards for MA131 and MA132, covering only\nprerequisite material (see below). In both of these courses, students must\ndemonstrate mastery of these basic skills in order to receive a grade of C or\nbetter.\n\nRequirement\n\nPassing a Calculus ABCs Test is a minimum requirement for getting a\ngrade of C or better in the course: passing means you may earn any grade (A\nto F) in the course (based on other coursework), while not passing means you\nmay earn no higher than a D+ (regardless of other coursework). This\nrequirement is part of MA131 and MA132 each semester they are taught, and also\napplies to placement tests for those courses administered at Clarkson.\nA passing score is 90% or better; all problems are graded right/wrong\n(essentially no partial credit). ABCs tests will be offered as needed during\nthe first half of the semester. Each student may take up to five tests in\norder to pass; if needed, they may take one last ABCs test during final exam\nweek (in addition to the regular course final exam).\n\nAdvice\n\nTake the test seriously--for many students this is a real challenge.\nPractice using the sample tests (see below) and learn the\nmaterial solidly before taking the test.\nDo not just show up and hope to pass by luck (you won't)--the only way\nto succeed here is to master the material.\nYou should also read the Instructions for Grading\nbefore taking the test, so you will know for sure what is expected.","id":"/543","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9770678281784058,"__label__0":0.022952241823077202}}
{"text":"About 2.0\n\nCK-12 Foundation introduces its version 2.0 which provides the component missing in version 1.0 – a focus around learning. At CK-12, we believe that learning is an individual activity requiring many things – multiple modalities, interactions with other human beings (such as teachers, peers, and parents) as well as collaborations. Hence, in this version of the system we combine student-centric learning with teacher-centric tools and materials to create a dynamic system that can be used by anyone. Our belief is that this will help in reducing \"gaps\" and provide the ability to fill these gaps.\n\nUsers will continue to find high quality, national and international standards aligned content in K-12 Science and Math subjects. As before, that content can be used to create customized books or courses. New to the system are concepts, smaller chunks of content that can be used to learn or review specific topics. The concepts are supported with many associated modalities as well as interactive and automated exercises and assessments allowing for students to see where they are and how they are progressing. Interactive learning objects as well as simulations from entities such as Wolfram will support these concepts. In addition, we will be providing a guiding system allowing students to learn at their own pace with purpose. This navigational system at the same time, will allow for teachers to mentor their students.\n\nVersion 2 of CK-12′s system is the next step toward the foundation's mission to increase the access of high quality educational materials for all. Important features include:\n\nHigh quality, standards-aligned content for science and math presented at the book and now concept levels. (Concepts can be combined to form chapters and books.) The previous format of book and chapter will still be available.\n\nA \"Concept Map\" to show the interrelation of concepts, providing a guided path of learning for those who are interested.\n\nAs always, the ability to edit and customize, both at the concept and book level.","id":"/544","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9080310463905334,"__label__0":0.09198900312185287}}

{"text":"Technology in Education\n\nMonday, April 5, 2010\n\nCabri 3D is one of dynamic geometry software. This software helps students with the visualization of 3D figures their properties. The purpose of this software is to help students to better understand three-dimensional space, since three-dimensional space is difficult to visualize. Cabri 3D allows students and teachers to construct and manipulate solid geometry objects in three dimensions. It provides a tool for teachers and students to explore properties of 3D geometric constructions\n\nEven though it is Cabri 3D, two dimensions objects can still be created. The software is suitable with many two dimensions concepts such as length, sectors of circles, lateral area, surface area. Cabri 3D will help students to learn analyzing characteristics and properties of two- and three-dimensional geometric shapes and develop arguments of mathematics about geometrical relationships. Students also can learn to use visualization, spatial reasoning, and geometric modeling to solve problems\n\nCabri 3D is appropriate for secondary school students. Even though the software is not very user friendly, the students can be successful with the program if they learn through the manual. Teachers who want to use it in their classes have to be advanced in using it. Even though the software is not user friendly, it still offers a lot of great features that help student to get success in learning mathematics especially in geometry class.\n\nMonday, March 15, 2010\n\nI reviewed a Mathematics WebQuest. Its title is Vector WebQuest. There are some weaknesses and strengths of this WebQuest. The weaknesses are it is not complex, does not have analytical question and does not has sufficient explanation on the process. On the other hand, the strengths of the WebQuest are an interested introduction and a range of web sites been accessed.\n\nThe most weakness of the WebQuest is it is not complex. It has only three parts. They are introduction, task and process. The WebQuest does not have evaluation, conclusion, and teacher page. Based on the criteria of a WebQuest, these elements are very important. Without Evaluation and conclusion, a WebQuest will be less useful. Another weakness is there is no any analytical question. Analytical questions are very important, since one of the purposes of a Webquest is to support learner thinking at the level of analysis. On this WebQuest, The level of questions is comprehension. Overall, the questions are not able to encourage students to think at high level thinking. The last weakness is it does not have sufficient explanation that is provided to students in order to accomplish the task. The WebQuest does not have full potential of web such as sound and video.\n\nOne of strength of the WebQuest is its introduction provides information that engages students to explore further. It is started with interesting issues. This issue will grab students' attention. Another strength is its link to supported documents such as vector form. Moreover, it also provides various web sites such as .com, .edu and .gov. Some of the links take students directly to pages they need to go.\n\nEven though the web quest has an interested introduction and various web sites been accessed, it is still inappropriate to be used by students because it does not fulfill the basic criteria of a WebQuest.\n\nFriday, February 19, 2010\n\nI am curious to learn and assess computer technology for learning mathematics and science. Even though there are many issues surround the using of computer technology in learning mathematics and science, computer technology offers new ways to learn. It helps students to learn based on problem solving. Another advantage is by using computer technology teachers can create inquiry-based mathematics and science classroom. Of course, besides those things, There are many other advantages of using computer technology in learning mathematics and science.\n\nOne of software that I am interested to learn is TinkerPlots. TinkerPlots is software for students in grades 4 through 8. The use of software is to build fluency with data representation and exploration. Animation, color, and dynamic manipulation support students in moving from simple representations to increasingly complex and analytic graphs. Another aim is to get students excited about what they can learn from data. TinkerPlots also helps teachers to create inquiry-based mathematics classrooms\n\nTinkerPlots is friendly and intuitive interface that allows the user to play with the data plotted in an infinite variety of formats.\n\nTuesday, February 9, 2010\n\nSpeech Recognition. Windows 7 has a feature that allows people to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. It is Speech Recognition. We can find this feature on Ease of Access. Before we get started using Speech Recognition, we will need to connect a microphone to our computer. There are some issues that we have to think about before using Speech Recognition: (1) Speech Recognition needs a good microphone. (2) Training the computer to identify the speaker sounds and pronunciation. (3) Speak clearly and pronounce words carefully, not too fast and or too slow. To open Speech Recognition: (1)Start the Speech Recognition by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking Ease of Access, and then clicking Windows Speech Recognitions. (2)Click microphone button to start the listening mode\n\nBy using Speech Recognition we can do the following things: (1) We can use our voice to control our computer. (2) We can say commands that the computer will respond (3) We can dictate text to the computer.\n\nSpeech Recognition makes a classroom or lesson more Universally Designed. Speech recognition allows students to use their voice to operate a computer and compose text. This feature is useful to students with a wide range of disabilities including those with visual, mobility and language impairments. This feature will be very useful in a classroom which the numbers of students with disabilities integrated into it. Today, nearly every class and schoolwork are related to computer. For example statistics class, students will analyze graphical displays of data, including dot plots, stem plots, and histograms, to identify and describe patterns and departures from patterns. In this class they will use computer to create graphical displays. By using Speech recognition and Microsoft excel, students with mobility impairment are still able to participate well in the class. They can input data and command to create a graphic.\n\nSpeech Recognition helps students with mobility and visual impairment. Students with mobility impairments might be unable to use (or be without) arms or fingers to interact with their computers using a standard keyboard or mouse. Using their voice is a way to interact with their computer. By using speech recognition they can operate their computer and compose text. Another is visual impairment, blindness, for example. Students who are blind interact with their computers through keyboards, Braille devices, and audio/voice rather than a traditional monitor and mouse. If they don't have these special devices, they are still able to operate their computer by using Speech Recognition.\n\nConclusion A more accessible technology is good for everyone, including students with disabilities and students without disability. All students benefit from technology in which it is easier to function. Providing accessible technology in the classroom to students with disabilities enables all students to have the same opportunities in education. Speech Recognition gives an easy way to interact with computer not only for students with a disability but also those without a disability. It also helps us to make an inclusive classroom with equal access for all students.\n\nMonday, January 25, 2010\n\nMathematics is my subject domain, during I taught mathematics I used some dynamic geometry software, such as Cabry, Geometer's Sketchpad, GeoGebra and Autograph. These are typically used in the classroom or the computer lab and they are very helpful in teaching the difficult concept.\n\nIt is little bit difficult to find an appropriate technology device in everyday life for teaching and learning the difficult concept of mathematics. Since mathematics concept is completely different from other concepts such as social science, English, etc.Based on my teaching experience in primary school, when I teach a difficult concept, I had to prove the concept and visualized it. these things can be done by using a software for teaching mathematics that requires a certain specification of a computer.\n\nHowever, Nowadays, there is a technology in education known as mobile learning. Mobile Learning is a learning model adopted cellular technology development and mobile phones where this technology can be used as a learning medium. To use this technology, we can download the applications and install them on a mobile phone or use them online by using mobile phone.\n\nMobile learning technology can be used to teach mathematics. One of web sites that provides mobile learning applications for teaching and learning mathematics is  So far, Mobile Learning is very helpful as a supplement material for teaching mathematics. It is easy for students to bring mobile phones wherever they go, this technology will help them to learn mathematics wherever and whenever.","id":"/548","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9765060544013977,"__label__0":0.02351398393511772}}

{"text":"Bringing a new vitality to college mathematics\n\nLet's talk variables. Do we want students to develop an understanding of variable concepts (whether in a developmental math course or not)? Is accurate use of variable notation enough? If students can model applications and accurately determine solutions … is that enough? Is there a role for linguistic literacy in mathematics?\n\nOne of the issues we face in college is dealing (or not) with prior learning. Without intervention, prior learning (even when inaccurate) survives — often surviving in the face of conflicting information in the current learning environment. Visualize the prior learning as being as a stable mass of 'knowledge' (even though it has gaps and errors); as students go through a class as adults, information that connects positively with the old reinforces the old. When new information does not connect or conflicts with the old, the low-energy (natural) response is to build new storage … resulting in that solid core being supplemented by weak veneers of new knowledge. This, of course, is an incomplete visualization for the actual processes in the human brain. The suggestion is that students approach a math class with an attitude that supports old information and minimizes cognitive effort for dealing with new or incompatible information.\n\nIn my beginning algebra class this week, we did the test on exponents and polynomials. Although the test includes some artificially difficult problems with negative exponents, most of the items deal with important ideas. One of the most basic items on the test was this:\n\nEvaluate a² + (3b)² for a = -3 and b = 2\n\nSeveral students made this mistake with the first term:\n\n-3² = -9\n\nA smaller group of students made this mistake with the second term:\n\n(32)²\n\nNow, this is a good class — all students are actually doing homework and attending class almost every day. We had dealt with the first situation at the start of the semester. How could these errors survive to this point?\n\nBoth errors are based on variable as a symbol to be replaced by a number, which is not complete. They might represent a visual approach, not verbal. Variables represent quantities involved in sums and products, where products with variables are implied … and more than this. Simplifying expressions might — or might not — uncover the incomplete understanding. What can I do to help students with this?\n\nI am planning on incorporating some linguistic activities around variables in the first week of the semester. Some of the ideas are from a old book called \"English Skills for Algebra\" from the Center for Applied Linguistics (Joann Crandall, et al); I believe this book is out of print. The authors wrote this book from the viewpoint of helping students with 'limited English proficiency', which might just apply to many of our developmental students. Some of their activities involve listening to somebody read mathematical statements and the student writing them down. I think I will mostly activities that deal with written statements — identifying translations and paraphrasing (both to algebra and from algebra).\n\nI do know that just saying \"that was wrong … this is right\" will not help these students develop a more complete understanding. I need to create situations where they get uncomfortable and really dig into the concepts related to variables. Some energy needs to be created so that we don't just place a veneer on top of that mass of prior knowledge; parts of that prior knowledge need to be broken up and put back together. Without that process, many of these students will be limited in their mathematics and blocked from many occupations.\n\nShare this:\n\n5 Comments\n\n(1) The concept of \"variable\" is a means towards an end. It should thus not be surprising that to \"teach an understanding of variable\" does not work. It cannot.\n\nIn a developmental context, the obvious end is the discussion of function: we need a paper representation for what we input.\n\nThus, my attempt in could not work because, as I eventually realized and mentioned in , I should have had—and will have real soon now—a \"Chapter 3 – Functions\".\n\n(2) The usual definition of powers does not work very well in the remedial situation. For something that works, see freemathtexts.org\n\nThus, 5(3b)^2 should be read as \"5 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 5•3b•3b, and the default rule \"when there is no coefficient, it goes without saying that it is 1″ lets us read (3b)^2 as \"1 multiplied by 2 copies of 3b\", i.e. 1•3b•3b.\n\n(3) Re \"linguistic activities\", what is very likely to work is having the mathematics text used as the reading material in a remedial English reading course. Of course, the text cannot be the usual prescriptive stuff (that takes students for idiots) but one that has faith in the ability of the students to be receptive to arguments.\n\nGranted, writing this kind of text is not easy.\n\nIn order to see what I mean, one might want to look up my own attempts which can be found at freemathtexts.org and freemathtexts.org","id":"/558","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9726703763008118,"__label__0":0.027349691838026047}}

{"text":"WHAT DOES A MATHEMATICS MAJOR STUDY?\n\nMathematics is one of the fundamental areas of human knowledge. It has held an established position among the humanities for over two thousand years, and in recent centuries it has played a vital role in the sciences. The body of mathematical knowledge is growing today faster than ever before, with old questions being answered and new ones asked at an unprecedented rate.\n\nIn the paragraphs below, we sketch some of the courses and topics which mathematics majors study at Wright State University. In each case, the illustrations of what students learn are only small samples of the full curriculum.\n\nMathematics majors typically begin their college mathematics studies with three semesters of Calculus. Calculus is both the cornerstone of \"analysis,\" one of the major branches of pure mathematics, and an indispensable tool for most of the sciences and engineering. Students learn to discover for themselves familiar formulas from high school geometry -- e.g., area of circle = πr2, volume of sphere = (4/3) πr3 -- and they learn how to investigate similar issues in more complex settings, as illustrated to the right. Students study mathematics describing such diverse phenomena as conservation of energy laws from physics, and continuously compounded interest from banking.\n\nAll mathematics majors also take one semester of Linear Algebra, usually by the beginning of the junior year. This basic topic resides within another major branch of pure mathematics, \"algebra\" and is also of critical importance in an extensive range of applications of mathematics, from management to structural engineering to telecommunications. In linear algebra, the study of linear equations, like those in beginning high school algebra -- but with the possibility of thousands of equations in thousands of unknowns -- leads to abstract mathematical spaces.\n\nThe Department of Mathematics and Statistics offers a variety of more advanced courses. Students decide which of these to take according to their interests and the particular degree which they seek.\nFor example, students apply multivariable calculus in probability and the mathematical foundations of statistical inference in Theory of Statistics. Related choices include Statistical Methods and Introduction to Experimental Designs, in which one learns how to collect and analyze data, for instance in scientific and industrial experiments.\n\nSimilarly, students can choose mathematics courses with special significance in computer science. A prime example is Applied Graph Theory, featuring mathematical models and algorithms applicable to such problems as traffic systems, activity scheduling, and design layout. Others are Cryptography (how to encrypt data securely) and Coding Theory (how to send messages that self-correct transmission errors).\n\nOther courses in applied mathematics emphasize mathematical theory and problem solving methods directed toward the physical sciences and engineering. An illustrative example at the junior level is Partial Differential Equations involving several variables (e.g., both space and time). They describe such phenomena as the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space, and the flow of heat in solids.\n\nCourses in pure mathematics concentrate upon the theoretical foundations of algebra, calculus, and other elementary courses, and at the same time point the way toward more advanced topics in modern mathematics. To illustrate, students in Real Variables (or theoretical advanced calculus) learn why the facts and computational methods learned in ordinary calculus are correct; in Modern Algebra, students study various abstract systems which include the familiar objects of school mathematics as special cases (whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, etc.)\n\nIn addition to taking many courses in the major field of study, every undergraduate at Wright State University is required to take a comprehensive program of General Education studies, including courses in history, English, economics, the sciences, and several other disciplines. Moreover, some degree programs allow students to take \"free electives,\" or courses chosen by students from essentially any area. Wright State's degree programs in mathematics have a generous allotment of these free electives.","id":"/563","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9646962881088257,"__label__0":0.03532375767827034}}

{"text":"Matrices are very powerful mathematical tools\napplicable in a wide range of real world problems.\nIntuitively, the main advantage in using matrices is that\nthey allow the logical manipulation of very large sets of\nnumbers at once. More rigorously, they allow the manipulation\n(and solution) of linear equation systems which\nin turn reppresent real world problems.\n\nJust as example, the voltages and currents\nin an electronic board with 1000 components can be described\nby a very huge system of linear equations. 1000 components\nimply 1000 unknown voltages and 1000 unknown currents. Attempting\nto find such a large number of unknown variables without a method\nis substantially a suicide. With the use of matrices such a system\ncan be solved in a very elegant way.\n\nToday, matrices are used not simply for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations,\nbut also for describing the quantum mechanics of atomic structure, designing computer\ngame graphics, analyzing relationships, and even plotting complicated dance steps :)\n\nIn this article we try to develop our mathematical tool step by step.\n\nDefinition\n\nA matrix is an ordered, bidimensional collection\nof mathematical expressions usually rapresented as a rectangular table.\n\nThe horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical\nlines are called columns. A matrix with m rows and\nn columns is called an m-by-n matrix (written mxn)\nand m and n are called its dimensions. The dimensions of a matrix\nare always given with the number of rows first, then the number of columns.\n\nIf the number of rows of a matrix equals the number of columns (m = n) then\nthe matrix is said to be square otherwise it's just rectangular.\nSquare matrixes have several interesting properties that we'll talk about later.\n\nThe entry of a matrix A that lies in the i-th row and the j-th column is called\nthe i,j entry or (i,j)-th entry of A. This is written as ai,j,\naij or A[i,j]. The row is always noted first, then the column.\n\nA special matrix with one of the dimensions set to 1 is called vector.\nA 1xn matrix is called row vector\n\nwhile a mx1 matrix is called column vector.\n\nIf the entries of a matrix are all real numbers then the matrix is said\nto be real. If the entries are complex numbers then\nthe matrix is too said to be complex. If the entries\nare polynomials then (guess what?) the matrix is said to be polynomial too.\n\nThe entries of a matrix usually have some associated meaning but for now\nlet's just say they are mathematical expressions (maybe numbers) and\nconcentrate on matrix manipulation.\n\nLet's play with it\n\nWe define the matrix sum as an operation that given\ntwo mxn matrices A,B returns a mxn matrix C with entries that are sums\nof the corresponding entries in A and B. Please note that the sum\nis defined only for matrices of exactly the same dimensions: we say\nthat such matrices are sum-compatible.\n\nFor sum-compatible matrices it's obvious that\n\nand\n\nWe define the scalar multiplication as an operation\nthat given a mxn matrix A and a scalar expression K returns a mxn matrix B\nwith each entry made of the corresponding entry of A multiplied by K.\n\nIt's again obvious that for sum-compatible matrices A,B and any scalar expression k\n\nand for any matrix A and any couple of scalar expressions\nk1, k2\n\nFood for thoughs: Multiplication by scalar is commutative\nif the underlying ring (of expressions) is commutative. This is true when the expressions\nare (real or complex) numbers or polynomials, that is most real-world cases in that matrices\nare applicable. However, the matrix algebra can be applied also to non commutative rings\n(for example quaternions) where the multiplication by scalar must be splitted in two\ndifferent operations: left multiplication and right multiplication.\n\nNot that obvious\n\nWe define the matrix multiplication as an operation\nthat given a mxp matrix A and a pxn matrix B\nreturns a mxn matrix C with element i,j computed\nas the scalar vector product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column\nof B.\n\nNote that the matrix multiplication is well defined only for\ncouples in that the left matrix has the number of columns equal to the\nnumber of rows of the right matrix. We say such two matrices\nto be multiplication-compatible.\n\nFood for thoughs: the multiplication\nof two nxn matrices processes 2 n2\nentries. However there is no known algorithm with computational\ncost of O(n2). Most algorithm\nare O(n3) and the most clever\nimplementations are O(n2.8).\nAn O(n2.376) algorithm has been proposed\nby Coppersmith and Winograd but its implicit factor hidden by the O() notation\nis so big that its implementation is worthwile only if we're going to\nmultiply matrices with n that is out of our current computing possibilities.\n\nIt's very easy to show that (and here comes the non obvious) the matrix\nmultiplication is generally not commutative, that is\n\nexcept for very few special cases. The (square) matrices for that\n\nare said to commute and must satisfy strict rules\non their elements.\n\nThe non commutativity of the matrix multiplication makes\nthe algebraic manipulation to become non trivial and causes\ninfinite headcaches to engineering students.\n\nHowever, we're lucky since the associative and distributive properties\nstill apply and it can be proven that the following equations are all true\n(given that the matrices involved are multiplication-compatible and\nthe underlying ring is commutative).\n\nTranspose\n\nWe define the transpose of a mxn matrix A\nas a nxm matrix B obtained from A by swapping rows with columns.\nThe transpose of a matrix A is often written as AT\nor as A'.\n\nNote that swapping rows with means effectively swapping\nthe order of indices of each element. The element aij\nof the matrix A becomes the element aji of\nthe transpose.\n\nFood for thoughs: This property is interesting in computer\nmatrix processing. To apply an algorithm to the transpose of a matrix instead of the original\none we can simply swap the parameters of all the matrix element access functions...\n\nA matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a symmetric matrix;\nthat is, A is symmetric if AT = A. Note that A must be\nsquare to be symmetric and internally the elements must satisfy the relation\naij = aji.\n\nIt's easy to show that\n\nfor any matrix A, thus the transposition is a self-inverse operation.\n\nAlso for two matrices with the same dimensions\n\nIf the matrices A and B are multiplication-compatible then\n\nNote that the order of multiplication is inverted.\n\nAnd finally taking the transpose of a scalar (1x1 matrix) is a null operation\n\nThe identity\n\nA particular square matrix that commutes with all other\nmatrices of the same size is the identity matrix.\nThe identity matrix has all unit elements on\nits main diagonal.\n\nIt's easy to prove that\n\nand thus the identity matrix is the \"unity\" element of the matrix algebra\nand the multiplication by the identity matrix is an idempotent operation.\n\nObviously the transpose of an identity matrix is still an identity matrix.\n\nThe inverse\n\nGiven a square matrix A we define the inverse matrix of A\nas the matrix that when multiplied by A gives the identity matrix as result.\nThe inverse matrix is usually written as A-1.\n\nThe inverse matrix does not necessairly exist. A matrix that has no inverse\nis said to be non invertible or singular.\n\nNote that A and its inverse (when it exists) do commute.\n\nFood for thoughs: for non square matrices\nwe can define the left (A-1A=I) and the\nright inverse (AA-1)=I. Such inverses\nhave few real world applications...\n\nIt can be shown that the inverse of a matrix is again invertible and that\n\nfor any invertible matrix A and that\n\nfor any invertible matrix A and any non null scalar k.\n\nIt can be also proven that\n\nfor invertible matrices A and B of the same size. Note that the order\nof factors is inverted and the formula is very similar to the one\nthat involves transposition.\n\nFinding the inverse of a matrix is a very common highly intensive computational task.\nThere are several algorithms that implement this operation and many of\nthem operate better on matrices with elements that satisfy certain properties\nor conformations.\n\nThe above system of m linear equations in n unknown variables can be rewritten\nby using matrices as follows\n\nThe rows of the A matrix on the left contain the coefficients\nof the linear equations of the system. The unknown variables and\nthe known terms are collected in row vectors x and b.\n\nSolving the system means finding the set of values x1,x2,...,xn\nthat satisfy all the equations at the same time.\nIn most cases (if the field of the matrix elements is\ninfinite) exactly one of the following statements is true:\n\nthe system is undetermined (the set of solutions is empty)\n\nthe system is overdetermined (the set of solutions contains infinitely many elements)\n\nthe system is exactly determined (the set of solutions contains contain exactly one element)\n\nThe most interesting case is obviously the one with exactly one solution.\nThe Rouche'-Capelli theorem states that for a system of linear equations with\nn unknown variables to be exactly determined there must be at\nleast n linearly independent equations.\nSince more equations are unnecessary then the most interesting\nlinear systems are described by a square coefficient matrix.\n\nBy using trivial manipulations we can now show that by inverting\nthe matrix of coefficients we can solve the system.\nWe multiply boths sides of the system equation by the inverse of A\n\nSince by definition\n\nso the formula above can be rewritten as\n\nand since\n\nthen trivially\n\nThe last formula is very important since it provides the\nreal motivation for studying the inverse matrices. If we're\nable to find the inverse of A, we can solve the system.\n\nDeterminants\n\nThe definition of the matrix determinant is quite scary.\nGiven a square nxn matrix A, it's determinant is defined as\n\nwhere E(n) is the set of permutations\nof the numbers {1,2,....n}, P is a single permutation taken out of that set and sgn(P)\nis a function that returns +1 if the permutation P is\neven\nand -1 if the permutation P is odd.\nP(i), then, is the i-th element of the permutation P.\n\nThe formula above is also known as Liebniz formula.\nand is better explained with an example. Consider the following 2x2 matrix.\n\nIn this case n is 2 and thus E(n) is the set of the possible\npermutations of numbers {1,2}. E(n) obviously contains only\ntwo elements: the trivial \"null\" permutation {1,2} (which is even)\nand the permutation {2,1} (which is odd).\n\nThe Liebniz formula expands then to a sum of two elements\ndictated by the two permutations just described.\nEach element of the sum is a product of n elements\nof the matrix taken from distinct columns. The row of each element\nis choosen by the permutation.\n\nIn the first product we move along the columns (indexed by i)\nfrom left to right and take the first and the second row (null\npermutation). This means a11 and a22.\nSince the permutation used is even, then the sign of this product is positive.\n\nIn the second product we move along the columns\nfrom left to right and take the second and then the first row\n(the odd permutation). This means a21 and a12.\nSince the permutation is odd, then the sign of this product is negative.\n\nThe determinant of the 2x2 matrix is then\n\nThis is rather easy to remember if you note that it's the\nsum of the products of the two diagonals of the 2x2 matrix.\nThe product is positive if the diagonal goes \"up\" from left\nto right while it's negative if the diagonal goes \"down\"\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 3x3 matrices is more complex\nand it contains 6 elements.\n\nIf you look close you can still spot the same pattern.\nThere are positive diagonal lines that go down from left\nto right and negative diagonal lines that go up\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 4x4 matrices becomes really complex\nand is rarely written explicitly. For larger n values\nthe formula becomes very difficult to use because\nit's hard to enumerate all the permutations of n numbers.\nOther methods for finding the determinant exist\nand later we'll probably spot some of them\nbut now let's look at some of the determinant properties.\n\nIt can be shown that for square matrices A and B, any scalar r\nand the square unit matrix I the following properties are true\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nInvertible matrices and their determinants\n\nSince for an invertible matrix A\n\nthen by property 4 of the previous paragraph\n\nand since\n\nthen\n\nwhich implies that\n\nand that\n\nConversely, it can be shown that a non-zero determinant\nfor matrix A implies that the inverse of A exists.\nThe proof requires the notion of the rank of a matrix\nwhich we haven't covered so I'm going to omit it here.\nHowever, the two deductions lead us to the following theorem:\n\n\"A matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non zero\"\n\nFood for thoughs:\nAs a rule of thumb, almost all square matrices are invertible. Over\nthe field of real numbers, this can be made precise as follows: the set\nof singular n-by-n matrices, is a null set, i.e., has Lebesgue measure zero.\nIntuitively, this means that if you pick a random square matrix over\nthe reals, the probability that it will be singular is zero.\nIn practice however, one may encounter non-invertible matrices. And in numerical\ncalculations, matrices which are invertible, but close to a non-invertible\nmatrix, can still be problematic; such matrices are said to be ill conditioned.","id":"/570","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9952450394630432,"__label__0":0.0047750226221978664}}

How fast is a car going if it accelerates for ten miles per hour every second for 20 seconds? How far has it traveled?

I said at the time the Manga Guides appeared to be a \"winning formula\", since the manga story motivated the reader to read on to the next chapter, and the books show empathy for the struggles students experience while learning such topics.\n\nI'm not as enthusiastic about the Linear Algebra volume, since I think it missed several opportunities to help the novice learner.\n\nGuide to Linear Algebra – the promise\n\nThe story involves Reiji, a skinny kid and Misa, the cute sister of a karate master.\n\nMany students struggle with linear algebra, so I was looking forward to diving in, especially to see the discussion on practical applications.\n\nThe good\n\nLet's face it. Most math books are not page-turners for most people. Anything a writer can do to maintain motivation is a good thing.\n\nKeeping with the tradition of the others in the series, The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has a cute story line. Nerdy Reiji takes on the job of tutoring the Hanamichi Hammer's little sister in the topic of Linear Algebra. In return, he can join the Hammer's karate club. In his first meeting with the big brother, Reiji is warned not to fraternize with Misa.\n\nThe manga story continues throughout the book between each slab of math. It works – you want to find out what happens next in the story and with math sandwiched between the manga, it's quite a good concept.\n\nIncluded are a few nice explanations of Japanese culture, like \"ossu\" (a saying used by martial artists to increase concentration).\n\nOn the math side, Gaussian Elimination in Japanese is \"Hakidashihou\", or \"Sweeping out\". This is a good way to remember the concept (both for Japanese native speakers and those reading a translation).\n\nThe not-so-good\n\nI feel that a book like this provides a great opportunity to discuss the \"big picture\" concepts, so readers become more aware of the \"why\" and \"how it is used\" of Linear Algebra. Leave the nitty-gritty of the micro-level math to the conventional textbooks and ensure the reader has the answers to the key what, why and how questions.\n\nCertainly the book attempts to achieve that outcome, however, I was disappointed that some of the opportunities were lost, and some of the messages promulgated by the book are unfortunate.\n\nEarly on, (p15), Misa asks some reasonable questions that most students will ask.\n\nMisa: But I still don't understand… What is linear algebra exactly?\n\nReiji: That's a tough question to answer properly.\n\nMisa: Really? Why?\n\nReiji: Well, it's pretty abstract stuff.\n\nHe goes on to explain the main idea using translations of 3-D objects to 2 dimensions (like drawing a building on a piece of paper).\n\nHowever, his summary would not be understood by most newbie students, I suspect:\n\nReiji: \"Linear algebra is about translating something residing in an m-dimensional space into a corresponding shape in an n-dimensional space.\n\nSay what? (If this was framed in a different way it may have been more convincing. Something like, \"The fancy way of saying this is…, but that simply means …\")\n\nMost people want to know how they will use what they are studying. Misa asks the classic question (p17):\n\nMisa: What exactly is it good for? Outside of academic interest, of course?\n\nReiji: You just had to ask me the dreaded question, didn't you? While it is useful for a multitude of purposes indirectly, such as earthquake proofing architecture, fighting diseases, protecting marine wildlife, and generating computer graphics… it doesn't stand too well on its own, to be honest…\n\n… Like it or not, it's just one of those things you've got to know.\n\nI feel the book would have been much stronger if it had been built around such practical examples, rather than concentrating on the (pure) math. Readers could still learn the theoretical concepts as a result of studying such examples. I'm not sure how many university students will be convinced by \"it's just one of those things you've got to know\".\n\nWhat came across to me in these 2 vignettes is Reiji is uncomfortable talking about the \"big picture\" aspects. It would have been more satisfying if he was less apologetic about why this topic is included in many undergraduate programs.\n\nPerhaps I'm being unfair here. Maybe my angst should be directed towards colleges who make topics such as Linear Algebra compulsory because \"it's good for the students\". This may be fine for math majors who have signed up because they love all sorts of math and don't mind what's offered, but for students studying other majors, they really should be given a good idea why they are doing it.\n\nAnd yes, I know all students should have their thinking challenged and broadened at college level, but it needs to be done meaningfully.\n\nCalculations\n\nSadly, the book concentrates too much on the calculations involved. Much of this calculation can, and should be done using computers, which then frees up time for everyone to learn the key concepts and how to apply them.\n\nIn the story, Misa is not a mathematics major. She, like many real students, ends up taking abstract courses like Linear Algebra with very little idea why, or when it will be useful to her. They learn it for the exam and promptly forget it.\n\nIt's not clear why Reiji launches into an explanation of complex numbers on page 25. Misa starts to become stressed, and Reiji says:\n\nReiji: I think it's be better if we avoided them for now since they might make it harder to understand the really important parts.\n\nExactly! Why even mention complex numbers (here) if they are not going to be used throughout the rest of the book?\n\nThe cofactor method is mentioned on p88, but Reiji says:\n\nReiji: The calculations invovled in cofactor method can very easily become cumbersome, so ignore it as long as you're not expecting it on a test.\n\nSadly, the message here is \"Learn for tests\".\n\nMisa: If this is on the test, I'm done for.\n\nReiji: Don't worry, they are usually only 2×2 or 3×3.\n\nSo why confuse the poor girl with much larger examples?\n\nWhy do we learn Gaussian Elimination? On page 88, we have:\n\nReiji: In addition to finding inverse matrices, Gaussian Elimination can also be used to solve linear systems.\n\nFair enough. But after doing an example which involved solving a system of equations, he says (p89):\n\nReiji: Gaussian Elimination is about trying to get this part here [pointing to the right hand side of the working] to approach the identity matrix, not about solving for variables.\n\nThis would leave many first-time students somewhat unsatisfied and confused. So why are we doing it again?\n\nPages 98 to 105 contain some really pointless – and complicated – calculation rules. Sarrus' Rule is particularly untidy. I say \"pointless\" because evaluating determinants is exactly the kind of thing we should let computers do. I say \"untidy\" because for non-mathematicians, there are hundreds of steps involved, many patterns to recognize and remember, and way too many places to make a mistake. And in this work, a mistake early on can bubble down through the whole problem. (Yes, students should learn to be accurate and to check their work. But matrix operations are universally disliked because they are tedious, prone to many mistakes and should be done using software in the first place.)\n\nHere the message that comes across is \"Math is about calculation\".\n\nShould have more…\n\nThroughout the book there are interesting practical examples, but they are only briefly mentioned. I'd like to see more examples and more space devoted to examples involving:\n\nEnlargements & rotations using matrices\n\nLinear transformations with graphs (e.g. p 212)\n\nArea of parallelogram (p 97) using determinants.\n\nVolume parallelpiped using 3×3 determinant.\n\nWho is the audience?\n\nI enjoy the Manga Guides concept, but I wonder how many math teachers would assign this as a text? (I wouldn't, since the math is too calculation-based).\n\nHow many students would buy it?\n\nThe Preface says it's for:\n\nUniversity students about to take linear algebra\n\nThose who've taken it in the past but don't understand it still\n\nHigh school students who are aiming to enter a technical university\n\nAnyone else with a sense of humor and an interest in mathematics!\n\nI put myself in the latter category. I did enjoy the story!\n\nLet me know if you have bought books in the Manga Guides series and are in any of the above categories. What was your experience learning from the book?\n\nConclusion\n\nI feel that the Manga Guide to Linear Algebra has missed the mark somewhat. The story line and artwork are very good, but concentrating on the calculation aspects of the math at the expense of the \"big picture\" aspects was a disappointment.\n\nShare this page\n\n2 Comments on \"Manga Guide to Linear Algebra – Review\"\n\nI bought this book because I have an interest in math & have a sense of humor. Or more likely a complete fear of mathematics since my encounter with differential equations! But now I'm heading to grad school, and the stuff I'm really interested in will deal with vector calculus and differential topology. So, I thought I'd at least learn what linear algebra was via comics. Seemed to work for me when the comic version of Bible came out in the 1980′s.\n\nWas I entertained while reading about linear algebra? Sure, probably much more so than if I just bought a book about it. I did learn some things about it, but the book just didn't cover a lot of \"why\". So, while not the best introduction to the subject, they did cover enough of the basics that I'll remember what things are.","id":"/585","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9677600264549255,"__label__0":0.032259952276945114}}

{"text":"MAA Review\n\nIn a 1990 paper entitled \"What Is Geometry?\" Shiing-Shen Chern [3] identified six pivotal developments in the history of geometry:\n\nEuclid's axiomatic treatment,\n\nthe introduction of coordinates (Fermat and Descartes),\n\nthe invention of the calculus (Newton and Leibniz),\n\nthe recognition of the fundamental role of transformation groups (Klein and Lie),\n\nmanifolds (Riemann), and\n\nfiber bundles (E. Cartan and Whitney).\n\nThe geometry presently taught in American high schools includes significant parts of (1) and (2), and some students get an introduction to (3). Transformations (4) make a cameo appearance in many contemporary American high school geometry textbooks, and play a featured role in a few. (5) and (6) have not influenced the high school curriculum.\n\nThe Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, which have now been adopted as a guide for the K–12 mathematics curriculum in 44 states, put transformations in center stage. Students in Grade 8 are introduced to geometry by experimenting with rotations, reflections and translations and they are expected to understand congruence in terms of rigid motions. High-school students develop these ideas more rigorously, learning standard terminology and fundamental facts about rigid motions and dilations of the plane as a foundation for the study of Euclidean geometry. In giving such prominence to transformations, the authors of the Common Core took into account both pedagogical evidence as well as the structure of the mathematics underlying the curriculum. Nonetheless, in view of the traditional organization of the curriculum, this is one of the bolder proposals of the Common Core.\n\nThe challenge will be implementation. We will need K–12 textbooks that are very different from those most widely used. At least as important will be assuring that teachers are intellectually equipped. Good scholarship presented in a form accessible to teachers (or those planning to become teachers) and focused on the meaning and role of transformations in geometry is needed. One would hope to find this in textbooks for junior/senior-level college geometry courses, but unfortunately few books fill the bill. There is no standard undergraduate course in geometry, and the available textbooks have less in common than the books for courses such as abstract algebra or basic analysis that have acquired a canonical form. Geometry textbooks tend either to present some kind of axiomatic treatment and then to branch off into topics or else to be, through and through, a sampling of approaches and ideas. Transformations tend to be treated in college in the same way that they are treated in high school, namely, as an interesting branch of a great tree.\n\nThe purpose of the book of Barker and Howe is to develop the main ideas about geometric transformations of the Euclidean plane and their applications. It could play a valuable role in introducing college students, especially future teachers, to this topic. However, it does not jump immediately to its main topic. Chapter I, which takes up the first 120 pages of the 529 pages of this text, is devoted to a careful development of Euclidean plane geometry based on an axiom system similar to SMSG, which features the Ruler and Protractor Postulates. This opening chapter sets the mathematical tone. It is careful, rigorous, thorough and explicit in its attention to detail. I expect that this would not only be a good book from which learn some geometry, but also a fine introduction to the habits of logical thinking and precise exposition that a math major needs to acquire.\n\nTransformations make their first appearance in Chapter II, which culminates on pages 157–161 by classifying the isometries of the plane according to the number of their fixed points, demonstrating that every isometry is a composite of at most three reflections, and proving that, for any pair of congruent triangles, there is an isometry that takes one to the other. Readers who are familiar with these theorems might wonder if 160 pages of preparation are needed. The main ideas in the proofs are intuitively clear, and can be conveyed vividly by well-designed paper-folding activities. But what a student will take away from an informal presentation is very different from what he or she might acquire by following the course that the book lays out. Paper-folding, whatever legitimate pedagogical purposes it may serve, does not equip learners with a useful language for reasoning about transformations. This book will provide plenty of opportunity to learn good mathematical language and practice its use.\n\nChapter III begins with a discussion of compositions of reflections and the kinds of plane isometries that may be produced, leading up to the classification of isometries as reflections, rotations, translations or glide reflections on page 188. Numerous fine color illustrations make the twenty pages of preparation for this theorem a delightful visual experience. This is followed by a discussion of orientation based on the proposition that the parity of an isometry is well-defined. The chapter then introduces the idea of a group of transformations and in a sequence of exercises beginning on page 203 invites readers to investigate the structure of many examples. The remainder of the chapter deals with factorization in the plane isometry group.\n\nChapter IV concerns similarities. This chapter is especially important for future teachers because of the prominence of similarities in high-school mathematics. The treatment here parallels the treatment of isometries in the previous chapters, building up to the structure and classification theorems.\n\nChapter V studies the conjugacy relation in transformation groups and the decomposition of groups into conjugacy classes. This chapter ends with an interesting but sketchy discussion of the idea of developing geometry from the group of symmetries alone by means of the correspondences between lines and reflections and between points and 180-degree rotations. As a matter of fact, this is an idea that was developed extensively in the early 20th century by German-speaking mathematicians Gerhard Hessenberg, Johannes Hjelmslev and Gerhard Thomsen; see [4]. The standard reference is Friedrich Bachmann's book [1]. Unfortunately, the works of Hessenberg, Hjelmslev and Thomsen have not been translated into English, nor has Bachmann's book. However, a good synopsis in English is contained in chapter 5 of [2].\n\nChapter VI describes applications of transformations to Euclidean plane geometry. Running from page 287 to 346, it includes numerous interesting results. Transformations appear sometimes as essential tools, sometimes as useful aids, sometimes as a way to interpret a construction and sometimes merely as a point of view. Section 2 describes some theorems on the concurrence of special lines in triangles.\n\nThe first theorem on the circumcenter (the point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle ABC) helps to illustrate my remark about the varying role of transformations. The proof is essentially as follows: Let w be the perpendicular bisector of segment AB and let u be the perpendicular bisector of segment BC. Let P be the point of intersection of w and u. Then P is equidistant from A and B because it's on w and also P is equidistant from B and C because it's on u. Therefore, P is equidistant from A and C, so P lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AC. Transformations illuminate the argument — w and u are axes of reflections and it is these reflections that show the congruence of segments AP, BP and CP — but certainly it is not necessary to know this to follow the proof.\n\nThe incenter, centroid and orthocenter are treated in a similar fashion, using arguments in which the role of transformations is clear, illuminating but not essential. Section 3 uses dilation about the centroid by a factor of –2 to unify a discussion of the Euler line and the nine point circle. Here, the transformation does some real work. Section 5 of this chapter concerns the orthocenter (the point of concurrence of the altitudes). The discussion hinges on the analysis of the composition of the reflections whose axes are the sides of a triangle. Here, transformations are not only hard at work, but are leading the development.\n\nChapters VI (pages 347–375) concerns the symmetries of bounded figures in the plane, leading up to a discussion of dihedral groups. Chapter VII (pages 376–458) is a careful treatment of frieze and wallpaper groups. The last chapter concerns area, volume and scaling.\n\nI had hoped to use this book in a one-semester course in geometry that I teach periodically, but up till now the scheduling has not worked out. The course is populated primarily by math majors who are seeking certification as secondary teachers. Most of these people take a proof-based course in real analysis as well as other junior/senior courses, including probability, abstract algebra, number theory and other advanced topics. The typical student in this group will likely struggle at first with the level of exposition in Continuous Symmetry, particularly if he or she has not previously taken the analysis course, but surely will be capable of handling it. Because the text is detailed and methodical, patience and persistence is needed. However, it clear and explicit enough that it will never leave students helpless or befuddled, provided they are serious and spend the time to read carefully.\n\nI plan to use the text next time I teach the class. I expect to have to pick and choose carefully, especially in the first chapter. I find the level of rigor of Euclid to be a very workable goal in this class. It does not pay off to be overly concerned with facts, such as the Crossbar Theorem, that are evident from the topological properties of diagrams. I think the geometry of the number line is an essential topic, and a good opening for the course. This is consistent with the layout of the book.\n\nMy goal will be to spend only enough time in chapter I to prepare for chapters II, III and IV. These, I want to treat carefully because of the tasks these future high-school teachers will face in the classrooms where they will eventually teach. I shall need to include some material on area and volume, and Chapter IX can support this. Some discussion of coordinates, particularly linear change of coordinates, will be desirable. For this, I shall need to supplement the book. R. Hartshorne has made some observations about conventions related to the Ruler Postulate in a review of this book that appeared recently in the American Mathematical Monthly. Anyone who plans to use the book should be aware of his remarks.\n\nAlthough I have mentioned them only once, the abundant, high-quality illustrations throughout the text are one of the most attractive features.\n\nThe book does not always choose the quickest or most elegant route to a result. For example, Proposition IX.2.14 on the area of a parallelogram could have been proved more elegantly by repeating Euclid's proof of Proposition 35 of Book 1 of the Elements. Nevertheless, I learned a lot by reading the book, mainly because the material is arranged in a manner that invites and inspires one to reflect about the connections among the ideas being discussed. It is thought-provoking throughout. If a textbook is meant to be a tool for learning, then the extent to which it makes one think in the manner of a mathematician is by far the most important feature — much more important than any quibbles about the slickness of a proof. I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to use this book in my classes.\n\nComments\n\nA full review of Continuous Symmetry was written by Robin Hartshorne for the American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 118, Number 6, June 2011, pp. 565–568.

Each math topic, whether it be algebra, word problems or his other DVDs on calculus, physics, etc. divides the topic into sub-topics, each of which is worked through in an ascending level of complexity through abundant problems drawn out on a white board. Avoiding lengthy lectures, Gibson gets down to basics and explores the necessary connections while working out problems at the board. In fact, most of what you'll see is the back of his head; he turns to instruct and give detail, but most of his explanations are interwoven with real problems.\n\nHis thorough breakdown of concepts is best demonstrated by sharing the outline of the courses","id":"/598","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.977593183517456,"__label__0":0.022426787763834}}

{"text":"A Journey in Algebraic Thinking\n\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that is teaching courses with names like Algebra I or Algebra II. The rest of the world, including our colleagues in Canada, teach mathematics, not as separate courses, but as a continuous program from elementary through secondary school. In the United States, some schools offer an alternative, such as an integrated program that incorporates algebra as a strand blended with geometry and other advanced topics. Others continue to offer a course sequence that includes Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II. In an increasing number of states, the study of algebra in some form is required of all students for high school graduation. Regardless of whether a school's secondary curriculum includes a separate course in Algebra I or is more integrated, we can take concrete steps to ensure that students will flourish and succeed when they arrive at the formal study of algebra. A key to this success is the development of algebraic thinking as a cohesive thread in the mathematics curriculum from prekindergarten through high school.\n\nAlgebraic thinking includes recognizing and analyzing patterns, studying and representing relationships, making generalizations, and analyzing how things change. Of course, facility in using algebraic symbols is an integral part of becoming proficient in applying algebra to solve problems. But trying to understand abstract symbolism without a foundation in thinking algebraically is likely to lead to frustration and failure. Algebraic thinking can begin when students begin their study of mathematics.\n\nAt the earliest grades, young children work with patterns. At an early age, children have a natural love of mathematics, and their curiosity is a strong motivator as they try to describe and extend patterns of shapes, colors, sounds, and eventually letters and numbers. And at a young age, children can begin to make generalizations about patterns that seem to be the same or different. This kind of categorizing and generalizing is an important developmental step on the journey toward algebraic thinking.\n\nThroughout the elementary grades, patterns are not only an object of study but a tool as well. As students develop their understanding of numbers, they can use patterns in arrays of dots or objects to help them recognize what 6 is or whether 2 is larger than 3. As they explore and understand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they can look for patterns that help them learn procedures and facts. Patterns in rows and columns of objects help students get a sense of multiplication and see that facts make sense. Patterns within the multiplication table itself are interesting to children and help them both learn their facts and understand relationships among facts. The process of noticing and exploring patterns sets the stage for looking at more complex relationships, including proportionality, in later grades.\n\nAs students move into the middle grades, their mathematics experience can focus on connecting their work with numbers and operations to more symbolic work with equations and expressions. At this level, the focus of the mathematics program should be on proportionality, perhaps the most important connecting idea in the entire pre-K–12 mathematics curriculum. This concept should take students well beyond the study of ratios, proportions, and percent. A real understanding of proportionality allows students to connect their experience with numbers and operations to ideas that they have studied in geometry, measurement, and data analysis. They begin to get a sense of how two quantities can be related proportionally, as seen on maps, scale drawings, and similar figures, or in calculating sales tax or commissions.\n\nA solid understanding of proportionality sets the stage for students to succeed in the more formal study of algebra. From this base, notions of linearity and linear functions emerge naturally. As students explore how to use linear functions to solve problems, the bigger world of functions that may not be linear begins to open for them. Looking at what is the same and what is different among functions lies at the heart of understanding algebraic skills and processes.\n\nThe journey doesn't end with a student's first formal study of algebra at high school. Continuous development of increasingly sophisticated algebraic reasoning can provide an avenue into the study of geometry and advanced mathematics. In the world outside school, these topics are not separated. When higher-level courses regularly incorporate opportunities to build on students' algebraic understanding, students are far more likely to succeed than if the courses present just one mathematical perspective.\n\nThe development of algebraic thinking is a process, not an event. It is something that can be part of a positive, motivating, enriching school mathematics experience. \"Developing Algebraic Thinking: A Journey from Preschool to High School\" is the Professional Development Focus of the Year for NCTM during the 2004–05 school year. Watch for opportunities to develop your own understanding of this important topic throughout the year, including as part of conferences, journals, publications, and the NCTM Web site.\n\nFor this month's questions, consider the following: How can we build algebraic thinking into the pre-K–12 curriculum at all levels? How should secondary school mathematics be organized to capitalize on the inclusion of algebraic thinking throughout the elementary and middle grades? What can NCTM do to support teachers in fostering the development of algebraic thinking?","id":"/623","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9089803099632263,"__label__0":0.09103972464799881}}

In the case of function ft-in>cm, the formula has 2 variables named inches and feet :\n\nMain features of My Calcul :\n\n* the calculation formulae can have up to 255 characters, with an unlimited number of parenthesis and named variables. The last value of each variable is memorized within one session, and it is offered as default value when the same variable is used again, in the same formula or in another formula.\n* the following functions are recognized in formulae: log, ln, factorial, sin, cos, tan, acos, asin, atan, cosh, sinh, acosh, asinh. The numbers pi and e are also recognized.\n* the calculator can operate in standard algebraic mode or in RPN mode (Reverse Polish Notation).\n\nMy Calcul features an equation solver module. When the user loads an equation with n variables (up to 6), the application automatically builds up a table with one line per variable. The table can be used like a small spreadsheet where the user enters values for any sub-set of n-1 variables and let the application calculate the value of the nth variable to solve the equation. Each cell in this special kind of spreadsheet is both an input cell and a calculated cell. This is very useful for all sorts of \"what if\" type calculations.","id":"/624","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9990711808204651,"__label__0":0.0009487979114055634}}

{"text":"Get to know your calculator early in any math course. Calculators are used for most routine arithmetic calculations now, and your ability to use a calculator will help to complete work accurately and efficiently.\n\nWhile calculators come in many different makes and model numbers, most of them operate in similar manners. The notes here are specifically intended to assist you in becoming familiar with the Texas Instruments' TI-30X or TI-30Xa, but you should find the same function keys on many other scientific calculator.\n\nFor most algebra courses, you will need a scientific calculator. A scientific calculator includes functions for LOG, LN, and exponents, among other useful keys. It also performs arithmetic according to the Order of Operations (a calculator with only the arithmetic operations +, -,, and ¸ probably performs operations sequentially and is not useful for any advanced mathematical work). The TI-30X calculators are scientific calculators.\n\nDo not worry if there are several keys you don't understand right now. This calculator will serve you well throughout your math courses, even to Calculus and beyond. Anytime you learn some new mathematics, try to learn how to use your calculator to go with it.\n\nBasic key operations\n\nON:\n\nKnow how to turn your calculator on and off (the solar model has no OFF; there are no batteries to conserve). Some calculators have an automatic shut off if not used for a few minutes. On the TI-30X, the ON button is the top right key. This is also the All Clear (AC) button, which effectively gives you a clean slate to work with. AC clears the screen to \"0\", clears all memories, and turns off special features (like statistical mode). Use AC only when you want a fresh start. Avoid using AC in the middle of an exercise.\n\nAC/ON\n\n2nd\n\nDRG\n\nLOG\n\nLN\n\nCE/C\n\nHYP\n\nSIN\n\nCOS\n\nTAN\n\nyx\n\np\n\n1/x\n\nx2\n\nS\n\n+\n\nEE\n\n(\n\n)\n\n¸\n\nSTO\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n´\n\nRCL\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n-\n\na\n\nb/c\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n+\n\n®\n\n0\n\n.\n\n+/-\n\n=\n\nPrimary functions:\n\nEvery key has a number, operation or function name printed on top of the button. This is the primary function for that key. These are likely the ones you will use most often. The primary functions are grouped, more or less, according to purpose.\n\nNumeric keys\n\nThese are the keys for entering numbers digit-by-digit. Use the key for entering a number with a decimal point, like 2.57. Use the key to change the sign of a number from positive to negative, or vice versa. This is most useful for entering negative numbers: simply type in the number, then press to make it negative. It is important to use the negative sign after typing the number, because -0 is just 0.\n\nArithmetic Operations\n\n¸\n\n´\n\n-\n\n+\n\n=\n\nThese are the basic operations of (from top to bottom) division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition. These may be typed in the order written in an exercise, and the calculator will automatically perform the entire calculation according to the required order of operations once the key is pressed. Use the key only at the end of your calculation, and press it exactly once (no more).\n\nNote that multiplication may be written with the symbols * or × as well as ´ . Multiplication may also be written with no symbol between numbers or parentheses; be sure to type in this case. Likewise, division may be written as ¸ or /. A fraction bar also indicates division.\n\nInclude parentheses (as written) in any arithmetic exercise. The parentheses keys may be used for any pair of grouping symbols, including \"(...)\" or \"[...]\" or \"{...}\". Type the parentheses just as they appear in your exercise. You may also need parentheses at times when they are not shown. For example, a fraction with more than just a number in the numerator or denominator may be enclosed in parentheses for quick entry. Try to compute by typing .\n\n(\n\n)\n\nThe correct answer is 7.\n\nError correction Keys\n\nAs described earlier, the button clears all previous entries and settings. Use this key when you start, but rarely afterwards. In the middle of calculations, is a better option. Pressed once, this key means \"Clear Error\". Use it to correct an incorrect number as you type during a longer entry. For example, suppose you are trying to calculate 28 (16) + 42, and you typed (but you notice this should have been 16, not 26). Press once to clear just the last number entry. Then type in the correct entry and the rest of the calculation: . You should get the answer 490.\n\nIf you typed well beyond the mistake, then press twice (to activate \"Clear\"). This clears the entire calculation from the screen, so you can start over. For example, in the above calculation, suppose you typed before noticing that the 26 should have been 16. Press and start over: .\n\n®\n\nOne other option (and a good one), is to make use of the backspace key. This key erases only the last digit typed. Press it once or more to get back to the mistaken digit, and then resume your calculation. Having typed , press the backspace twice, then continue with 16 to get the correct answer. Note that the backspace will only erase digits, not operations.\n\n1/x\n\nx2\n\nyx\n\nExponent and Root Keys\n\nYour calculator also has keys for performing any exponent calculations. The simplest of these is perhaps the key, which squares the number currently displayed on the screen. Enter the base number first, then press . The result is displayed immediately. Try 92 by typing ; the answer is 81. Try 162 on your own (the answer is 256).\n\nThe opposite of squaring is the square root. gives the square root of the number currently displayed on the screen. Try out and .\n\ngives the reciprocal of the number on the screen. Literally, this is 1 divided by x. Mathematically, 1/x is also the same as x-1. On some calculators, the key is . For example, to quickly change 1/200 to a decimal, type . The screen will show 0.005. Likewise, to find 50-1, type to get 0.02.\n\nFinally, the calculator also has a key for doing more general exponents (all three of the above can be done with the exponent key, but they have special easy to use buttons because they are so commonly used). The exponent key is (find it just above the division key). Essentially, pressing this key tells the calculator that the next number you input will be an exponent for the number already on the screen. One nice feature is that the exponent can be any possible number (integer, fraction, decimal, or even another calculation enclosed in parentheses). Always enter the base number first, followed by the exponent key, and then the exponent. Press the key after entering the exponent (or continue the rest of the calculation if there is more). For example, find 210 by typing (the answer is 1024). To compute 0.2-3 type (answer is 125). Note that the negative exponent is entered by typing 3 followed by the key.\n\nMemory Keys\n\nSTO\n\nRCL\n\nThe memory keys allow you to save up to three different numbers for later use. To save the number currently on the display, type . This \"stores\" the value in memory cell 1 (replace with or to use memories 2 or 3, respectively). To \"recall\" a number stored in memory cell 1, use . To try this out, let's compute x2 - 17x + 5, using the memory cell 1 for x when x = -3.217. First enter the number, change the sign to negative, and store it in cell 1 as follows: . Then type in the computation, using for each occurrence of the variable x:\n\nDo not forget to include the \"times\" symbol between \"17\" and \"x\" in the middle term. The answer displayed should be 70.038089.\n\nBy substituting or for after , you can use up to three values for use in a single calculation. The memory cells are especially useful if you have a lengthy number (avoid copying and retyping) or if you expect to use the same number several times.\n\na b/c\n\nThe Fraction Key\n\nPerhaps one of the nicest features of this particular calculator is its ability to work fraction arithmetic. When properly entered, the calculator will use fractions correctly in any calculation. First, you need to know how to enter a fraction.\n\nSingle fraction: Enter the numerator (top number), press the fraction key , then enter the denominator (bottom number). So the fraction is entered as . The calculator displays the fraction something like .\n\nMixed numbers: Use the fraction key twice. The mixed number is entered as . In short, simply press the fraction key between each number in a fraction or mixed number. Your calculator knows the difference. The mixed number is displayed as .\n\nNow you are ready to use fractions in other calculations. Simply enter the fraction wherever it appears as you continue typing the entire calculation. For example, try computing by entering the following sequence:\n\nThe answer will be displayed as a fraction or a mixed number (if more than 1). In this case, you should get , which means .\n\nSecondary Functions and the Key.\n\nYou have probably noticed by now that the calculator also has writing just above each key. To save space, the calculator was made so that each key can perform two separate functions. The primary function is labeled directly on the key as is used simply by pressing the desired key (everything we have discussed so far is a primary function). To activate a secondary function, first press and then the key below the name of the desired function. A few commonly used secondary functions are, , and .\n\nfinds roots of any index. This is really just the opposite of the exponent key. Enter the number under the radical, press the key, then enter the index of the root. Press if finished, or continue the calculation. To compute , enter . Note that the key changes the meaning of the key to . You should get 12 for the answer.\n\nAbove the fraction key is the improper fraction function . This is nice for converting a mixed number into a pure fraction (although called improper, a single fraction with any numerator and denominator is usually easier to use in algebraic expressions than the equivalent mixed number). In the section on fractions, we did a calculation that gave the answer . This can be converted to a pure fraction by pressing , which activates the secondary function and displays the fraction . Written as a fraction rather than a mixed number, the answer is .\n\nAnother related secondary function is , above the backspace key. The label stands for Fraction-to-Decimal. By pressing this key, any fraction on the displayed will be changed to its decimal form. If the display is a decimal number, the calculator will try to write the number as a fraction, but this is not always possible. So if the decimal number remains, then there is no simple equivalent fraction (remember that the calculator can only do fractions with 3-digit numbers). For example, convert to a decimal just by pressing . You should see 4.6 on the display. Press again to change the answer back to fraction form (you get because the calculator prefers mixed number form). Press to get back to the pure fraction form .\n\nDRG\n\nLOG\n\nLN\n\nHYP\n\nSIN\n\nCOS\n\nTAN\n\nMost everything else\n\nare keys you won't be needing until a College Algebra or Calculus course or beyond. You will learn about the keys for the logarithmic and trigonometric functions later. Most of the secondary function keys are used for probability and statistics.\n\nCalculator Exercises\n\nUse a calculator to compute each of the following. When the answer is a fraction, give the answer in (a) mixed number form and (b) fraction from.","id":"/629","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9941646456718445,"__label__0":0.005855394992977381}}

When they went into the public schools of the Midwest to recruit, standardized testing gave them the means to select which lucky students would be deemed most suitable for an Ivy League education. But about a third of the way through the book, Lemann shifts gears and writes about several college students from the late '60s and early '70s. The reasons for the change-up only become clear in the final third, when those same college students, now in their 40s, lead the fight against California's Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot initiative aimed at eliminating affirmative action programs.\n\nDo these two stories really belong together? For all his storytelling abilities--and they are prodigious--Lemann is not entirely persuasive on this point, especially when he identifies the crucial moment in the civil rights era when \"affirmative action evolved as a low-cost patch solution to the enormous problem of improving the lot of American Negroes, who had an ongoing, long-standing tradition of deeply inferior education; at the same time American society was changing so as to make educational performance the basis for individual advancement.\" Lemann's muddled transition is somewhat obscured by frequent digressions (every new character gets a lengthy background introduction), but a crucial point gets lost in the shuffle, only to reappear fleetingly at the conclusion: \"The right fight to be in was the fight to make sure that everybody got a good education,\" Lemann writes, not to continue to prop up a system that creates one set of standards for privileged students and another set for the less privileged. If The Big Test had focused on that issue, where equal opportunity is genuinely at stake, instead of on the roots of standardized testing, where opportunity was explicitly intended only for a chosen few, it would be a substantially different book--one with a story that almost assuredly could be told as engrossingly as the story Lemann chose to tell, but perhaps with a sharper focus. --Ron Hogan[via]\n\nMore editions of The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy:\n\nGeorge Thomas' clear precise calculus text with superior applications defined the modern-day calculus course.

[via]\n\nThe development of statistical theory in the past fifty years is faithfully reflected in the history of the late Sir Maurice Kendalls volumes The Advanced Theory of Statistics. The Advanced Theory began life as a two volume work (Volume 1, 1943; Volume 2, 1946) and grew steadily, as a single authored work until the late fifties. At that point Alan Stuart became involved and the Advanced Theory was rewritten in three volumes. When Keith Ord joined in the early eighties, Volume 3 became the largest and plans were developed to expand it into a series of monographs called the Kendall's Library of Statistics which would devote a book to each of the modern developments in statistics. This series is well on the way with 5 titles in print and a further 7 on the way. A new volume on Bayesian Inference was also commissioned from Tony O'Hagan and published in 1994 as Volume 2B of the Advanced Theory. This Volume 2A is therefore the completely updated Volume 2 - Classical Inference and Relationship. A new author, Steven Arnold, was invited to join Keith Ord and they have between them produced a work of the highest quality. References have been updated and material revised throughout. A new chapter on the linear model and least squares estimation has been added.

Its footprints are virtually everywhere - in the spread of forest fires, mass extinctions, traffic jams, earthquakes, stock-market fluctuations, the rise and fall of nations, and even trends in fashion, music and art. Wherever we look, the world is modelled on a simple template: like a steep pile of sand, it is poised on the brink of instability, with avalanches - in events, ideas or whatever - following a universal pattern of change. This remarkable discovery heralds what Mark Buchanan calls the new science of 'ubiquity', a science whose secret lies in the stuff of the everyday world. Combining literary flair with scientific rigour, this enthralling book documents the coming revolution by telling the story of the researchers' exploration of the law, their ingenious work and unexpected insights. Mark Buchanan reveals how the principle of ubiquity will help us to manage, control and predict the future. More controversially, he claims that it may well contain the beginnings of a mathematics of cultural and historical change. Every decade sees a major scientific breakthrough that has implications that go way beyond science. 'Ubiquity' is one of them.

{"text":"Math\n\nDr. Richard Newcomb, Head of Department\n\nSchool mathematics should engage students in real mathematics. This view is at the center of the teaching and learning of mathematics at Cistercian. Every departmental course at Cistercian seeks to engage our students in both formal and informal modes of mathematical reasoning. The journey from arithmetic to calculus begins with Cistercian's Middle School mathematics curriculum. The focus here is first on developing the students' understanding of rational arithmetic and basic geometry. The second two years of the Middle School are considered together as serving the purpose of introducing algebra into the treatment of both arithmetic and geometry.\n\nMathematics in the Upper School begins with Euclid's geometry. Students need to learn geometry, not only because it is indispensable for all of applied mathematics, engineering, architecture, physics, and calculus, but even more importantly because it has simply speaking set the standard that any piece of reasoning must meet to be called a branch of mathematics. Forms VI and VII are a continuation of the earlier forms but the weaving of geometry and algebra is now more complete. Cistercian's mathematics curriculum culminates in Form VIII with a yearlong calculus course taught at the college level with a selection of material which also allows willing students to take the Advanced Placement exams in calculus.\n\nAt the same time, topics from discrete mathematics such as counting and probability are important and are included in each required course. Moreover, students wishing to delve deeper into these topics can take advantage of various mathematics electives in the Upper School as well as join Cistercian's Math Club or one of our many math teams.\n\nDepartment Faculty:\n\nDr. Richard T.

Answers to the practice problems are provided in the back of the Homework Helper book.\n\n*Homework Helper included in Bridge to Algebra and Algebra I curricula.\n\nWhat Makes Carnegie Learning Student Texts Engaging?\n\nLearning By Doing Principles\n\nCarnegie Learning believes that students develop math understanding and skills by taking an active role and responsibility for their own learning. With Carnegie Learning textbooks students become engaged in solving contextual math problems that strengthen their conceptual understanding of math topics. Rather than encouraging students to memorize procedures, we provide them opportunities to think and work together in small groups.\n\nReal-World Context\n\nStudents work with their peers to solve real-world problem situations like using percents for leaving a tip in a restaurant or using a graph of an equation to determine the number of days it will take to build miles of highway. They become more engaged in learning mathematics when they see how it plays a significant role in everyday life.\n\nMathematical Discourse\n\nThroughout the student text icons prompt different forms of student communication. These icons may instruct students to work independently, work with groups, or share ideas with the class.

{"text":"The four graphing modes provide a structure of the four sections of the book:\n\nUsing function graphing\n\nYou may well be familiar with the basics of this type of graph drawing but, unless you have spent many hours using your calculator in conjunction with its operating manual, you will undoubtedly find that there are graphing techniques in this section that are new to you and that are interesting and fun.\n\nUsing polar graphing\n\nUnits 4 and 5 form a short section involving the use of polar graphing. Polar coordinates are explained and you are shown how to produce spirals and other interesting shapes like the heart-shaped one shown here. This section could be studied independently of the rest of the book.\n\nUsing parametric graphing\n\nAfter an introduction to this graphing mode in Unit 6, the next two units deal with applications in mechanics, and Units 9 and 10 with applications in pure mathematics. Each pair of units could be studied independently.\n\nUsing sequence graphing Unit 11 provides an introduction to iterative methods of defining sequences in general and the next four units cover time-sequence graphs, staircase and cobweb diagrams and phase plots. Units 11 to 16 are best worked through in order.\n\nThe DfEE in England and Wales published the Key Stage 3 National Strategy, Framework for teaching mathematics: Years 7, 8 and 9. Central to the Framework is the appropriate use of technology, particularly graphics calculators.\n\nThis book provides 30 lesson plans, each consisting of a page of teacher notes and one or more student handouts. These are written specifically for the Texas Instruments TI-83 or TI-83 Plus calculators. The teacher notes reflect the lesson structure suggested in the Framework: Starter à Main activity à Plenary session.\n\nAlso in the teacher notes is a section containing all the information needed to link the lesson to the National Strategy Framework document.\n\nWhat calculator skills are needed? The lesson outlines assume a very basic level of competence with the calculator, particularly for the teacher. In every lesson there is reference to the teacher using a view-screen calculator as a sort of electronic blackboard for full-class teaching. Teachers who are not confident users of the calculator will find that a copy of Calculator Maths: Foundations Plus will help them acquire all the basic calculator skills that they will need for these 30 lessons. The other books in the Calculator Maths series are also a useful complement to this one, with lots more activities for use at Key Stages 3 and 4.\n\nThis new book is a companion to the very successful 30 Calculator Lessons. It has been written to motivate, challenge, entertain and enlighten students aged 11 to 16.\n\nThe new book provides another 30 plans for lessons, each consisting of a page of teacher notes and two more of student handouts. Once again, these are written specifically for the Texas Instruments TI-83 or TI-83 Plus calculators.\n\nHowever, each of these lessons is based on a simple calculator program that students are encouraged to create for themselves.\n\nShort programs This is certainly not a book of clever and complicated programs for teachers to dazzle the class with!\n\nOn the contrary, these photocopiable worksheets, help pupils to create their own short programs and show how they can be gradually built up from the bare bones of a skeleton version to something more sophisticated.\n\nPrice: £30.00( )\n\nQuantity:\n\nAlgebra ThePrice: £8.95( )\n\nQuantity:\n\nShapeNumberHandling DataFoundations Plus The first book in a series of five, Foundations Plus covers all the basic calculator skills.

The books have been written with the Texas Instruments families of graphics calculators in mind - the TI-83 and TI-84. If you are using another make or model of graphics calculator you may need to adapt many of the activities, although the ideas and principles can still be applied.\n\nWhat maths does the series cover?

{"text":"Algebra 2A/B Syllabus\n\nThis course is an extensionBe reminded, Algebra 2 is NOT an introductory course and topics learned in Algebra 1 will not be rehashed but rather built upon. And, because all Indiana state universities and colleges require Algebra 2 for admission, this Algebra 2 course is taught at the college preparatory level and taught for proficiency on university admission tests.\n\nStudents will work to their potential and ultimately benefit from taking this class as borne out from recent SAT scores. Those who score well in algebera 2 do well on college admissions tests.\n\n5.Graphing calculators – provided in class, will be used to aid in exploring Algebra; however graphers will not be used as a \"crutch\" for applications that students cannot perform on their own.\n\n6. A positive attitude – \"If there were one word that could be used to describe a successful person, that one word would be ATTITUDE.\" Bart Starr\n\nAssignments/Make-up Work:\n\nHomework will be assigned on a daily basis and generally due the following day (at the beginning of class). Though assignments are generally not graded, I retain the right to grade homework for completeness and effort, and at times for accuracy. Homework checks/pop quizzes will be given regularly. Problems from recent previous assignments will be given to the student at the beginning of class the next day, to complete in class with use of notes/binder/homework within a reasonable amount of time. Adequate time is allowed to complete the homework check provided the student has completed his or her assignment.\n\nI expect every problem in each homework assignment to be given an honest attempt by you. Each problem should have logical work showneven though you are convinced that your work or answers are wrong. Anything less than an honest attempt is considered incomplete. A zero will be given for a homework assignment turned in with answers only, unless specified by your teacher.\n\nStudents will assume the responsibility to find out what work and notes you missed while absent and that you complete those tasks promptly. After your return to school, you will be allowed one day per day absent to complete all missing material. If you miss a homework check, then expect to turn in the appropriate assignment in its place. If you are absent the class before a test/quiz, expect to take the test/quiz on the regularly schedule day (this means you must review on your own). If you are absent the day of a test/quiz, expect to take the test/quiz on the 1st day you return.\n\nFinally, you will receive at most, only half-credit for any late paper.\n\nClassroom Policies:\n\n1. Be respectful at all times (towards me, other faculty, and your classmates). I will respect you.\n\n2. Be on time and prepared (have sharpened pencil, paper, homework, and calculator ready to go when the bell rings!)\n\n3. Be responsible for all material discussed while you were absent on a field trip and upon return the next day, have completed all assignments due. PLAN AHEAD FOR FIELD TRIPS!!!\n\n4. Be on task and use study/homework time to work exclusively on your math assignment. When your math assignment is completed you may then use that extra time to work on another assignment.\n\n5. Be honest with your work on all assignments, projects, tests and quizzes whether graded or not. If you are found to have cheated, you will receive a zero for that grade, your CPG will be docked 5 points, and you will be referred for disciplinary action and a Friday night school.\n\n6. All Manchester Jr/Sr High School rules apply.\n\nPossible Consequences *:\n\n1. Verbal warning\n\n2. A meeting with Ms. Stone\n\n3. Parents called\n\n4. Loss of CPG points (see CPG contract)\n\n5. Written referral\n\n*Any serious infraction will be referred to the office immediately.\n\nGrading:\n\nYour individual midterm and semester grades depend on several different\nscores:\n\n1. Tests (a major portion)\n2. Announced Quizzes\n3. Frequent Pop Homework checks\n4. Homework—I reserve the right to grade any assignment. 5. CPG (a score out of 25 points)—recorded at end of semester\n6. Extra-credit, recorded at the end of thesemester\n\nMake-ups:\n\n1. If you miss an ANNOUNCED quiz, your grade will be recorded as 0 out of 0. It does not count for or against your grade.\n\n2. If you miss a POP homework check, then I will grade the homework assignment pertaining to the checked material.\n\n3. IF YOU MISS CLASS DUE TO A FIELD TRIP OR PRE-ARRANGED ABSENCE, ALL HOMEWORK, QUIZZES, OR TESTS DUE ARE EXPECTED ON THE DAY YOU RETURN.Field trip participants ARE NOT CONSIDERED ABSENT!!!\n\n4. For all others absences, you have one day for every day you missed to complete the outstanding assignments, tests or homework check. After such time, if the work is still missing, the grade will be recorded as a zero!\n\nYou will be expected to keep track of your own point totals. An assignment sheet is provided for that purpose. Grading Scale: (in percents)\n\nAny \"rounding\" will be done on an individual basis. Attitude, effort, class participation, etc. will be considered in any rounding situation. .5% and above is not necessarily cause for me to automatically round up!\n\nSemester Average = 80% from your total percent in a semester (including any extra credit and CPG) prior to the final exam\n\n+ 20 % from the final exam percent.\n\nIf a midterm grade is given, it will be based on your total points earned divided by the total points possible.\n\nExtra credit and CPG are added in when determining the semester grade.\n\nExtra Credit:\n\nThere will be minimal opportunities for extra credit. The best way to get extra credit is extra effort. Show me that you are working to your potential. Be an active participator in class. It won't go unnoticed.\n\nHELP:\n\nMy job is to help you reach your potential. Your success in this class is vitally important to me. I am often available for extra assistance before each school day (7:45 AM, after each school day until 3:30 PM or later by appointment, and at home, via phone. Students are encouraged to call me at home (982-2949, prior to 8 pm) for extra help with their homework. Further assistance is available from peer tutors in the study hall , via the internet at the website listed on the front of your textbook. After school tutoring is available to all free of charge from 3:30-4:30 PM M-TH.There is also FREE homework assistance through Rose Hulman Institute at 1-877-ASK-ROSE (toll free) every Sunday – Thursday evenings, 7-10 PM, excluding any Rose Hulman breaks.\n\nI want this class to challenge you, to satisfy your intellectual curiosity, and to fulfill your academic needs. You WILL have to work hard, but I can guarantee you that I will be working even harder to see you meet your goals.

{"text":"Mathematics\n\nTo achieve the goal, the department develops and improves its curriculum integrating strengths of American, Japanese and other countries' curricula. In particular, American textbooks contain various types of basic practice problems, which help students build a solid foundation of each mathematical concept, while Japanese textbooks and problem solving books contain many problems requiring multiple steps for their solution, which help students develop ability to apply their knowledge to solve complex problems. Both American and Japanese textbooks are used. Indian textbooks are also used to take advantage of their clear and easy-to-understand presentation of proofs of theorems and formulas.\n\nThe curriculum is constructed taking the cognitive development of each student into account. In general, more abstract concepts are introduced at higher grade levels. At each grade level, students are placed in one of two to three levels that best fits their cognitive and mathematical development. The goal for each level is set so that students will feel that they can reach the goal if, but only if, they put effort into studying mathematics. Each grade level has the following goal:\n\n9th Grade\n\nIn the 9th grade, all students are required to take the course \"Algebra and Geometry.\" The goal of this course is to develop student competence to deal with mathematical expressions, the basic language of mathematics. In particular, the course is designed to develop students' fluency in algebraic manipulations with polynomials and irrational numbers and to develop the ability to construct geometric proofs. Students are placed in either an intermediate or an honors level class, based on the results of a placement test. The course includes the following topics: Equations, Inequalities, Exponents and Polynomials, Polynomials and Factoring, Systems of Equations, Radical Expressions and Equations, Relations and Functions, Quadratic Equations, Introduction to Probability and Statistics; Congruent Triangle, Applying Congruent Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Similarity, Circles, Polygons and Areas, Surface Area and Volume.\n\n10th Grade\n\nIn the 10th grade, all students are required to take the course \"Algebra and Trigonometry.\" The goal of this course is to continue developing student competence to deal with mathematical expressions. The course develops fluency in algebraic manipulations, especially with rational and radical expressions, and in solving quadratic equations. Students are placed in either an elementary, intermediate or honors level class based on the results of a placement test. The course includes the following topics: Equations and Inequalities, Systems of Equations and Problem Solving, Polynomials and Polynomial Equations, Equations of Second Degree, Rational Expressions and Equations, Polynomial Functions, Powers, Roots, and Complex Numbers, Quadratic Equations, Relations, Functions and Graphs, Quadratic Functions and Transformations, Exponential and Logarithmic Functions, Trigonometric Functions, Trigonometric Identities and Equations, Counting and Probability.\n\n11th Grade\n\nIn the 11th grade, all students are required to take the course \"Pre-calculus.\" The goal of this course is to develop student competence in logical and abstract thinking. Building on the competence developed in previous courses, 11th grade students fully utilize their ability to understand mathematically-expressed abstract concepts and to express their own ideas mathematically. This training logical and abstract thinking will be extremely valuable throughout their lives. Students are placed either in an elementary, intermediate, or honors level class, based on their Algebra and Trigonometry course grades. The course includes the following topics: Trigonometric Functions, Introduction to Three dimensional Geometry, Vector Algebra, Permutations and Combinations, Binomial Theorem, Probability, Straight Lines, Conic Sections, Matrices, Determinants, Sequence and Series, Mathematical Induction, Three Dimensional Geometry.\n\nThe mathematics core curriculum is structured on mathematical content areas. To develop students' problem solving ability of utilizing knowledge of various mathematical content areas, 11th graders can elect \"Advanced Problem Solving\" course. Although the course mainly focuses on mathematical problems, it may include real world social, economical, and environmental problems as well. For students to qualify for the course, they must (1) be in an honor level Algebra and Trigonometry class at the end of the 10th grade and (2) participate in the American Mathematics Competition (AMC-10) during the 10th grade.

The calculus part will be taught in the first three quarters of the school year and the linear algebra part will be taught in the forth quarter. This is a very demanding fast paced course and all the students enrolled in the course are expected to devote a lot of time and effort to study outside of class by reading textbooks and solving problems in the textbooks","id":"/675","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9730780124664307,"__label__0":0.02694205567240715}}
{"text":"Math\n\nThe College Prep math curriculum focuses on building a strong conceptual base that helps students to become flexible thinkers, able to apply the mathematics they have learned to a rapidly changing world.\n\nMath teachers have designed materials for incremental learning and to address a variety of learning styles, including visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Students learn concepts and skills by solving carefully sequenced problems; in class, students often work in cooperative groups. Teachers coordinate courses and review frequently so students retain important ideas from year to year. Instead of separate courses in algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, all three areas are addressed in each course of an integrated curriculum. Course materials introduce applications to science and other related fields and provide historical context.\n\nCalculators and computers are important tools of modern mathematics. Teachers instruct students in their appropriate use, but also require a firm grasp of basic skills. Students are required to solve many problems without using calculators. The Math Department uses placement examinations, recommendations, and interviews to ensure that each student enrolls in the most suitable course sequence. Almost all students take four years of mathematics, even though only three are required. Math Club meets regularly to share ideas and investigate problems beyond the scope of the normal curriculum. All interested students are welcome to participate. The club also provides opportunities for students to take part in local and national mathematics competitions.\n\nMath I\n\nConcepts and applications of algebra, problem solving, and geometry are the main topics in this course, designed to prepare students with diverse mathematical backgrounds for Math II. Students learn how to use the scientific calculator to solve problems and use manipulatives extensively to develop spatial visualization skills. They often work together in small groups in the classroom, developing their collaborative skills and their ability to explain mathematics clearly. Students review and practice algebra skills in a wide variety of situations. Topics include proportional reasoning, geometric similarity and transformations, area and perimeter, linear and quadratic equations, and introductory statistics and probability. This course is coordinated with Integrated Laboratory Science.\n\nMath II\n\nThis course covers topics from geometry and algebra. The curriculum encourages connections among topics by continually interweaving them. Emphasis is placed on the development of geometric intuition, deductive logic, proof, and a strong foundation in algebra. Group work is encouraged; activities are done in groups, sometimes with physical models and or computers. Class discussions and group activities enrich the learning experience by developing problem-solving and communication skills.\n\nMath III/IIIA\n\nThe concept of function serves as a framework for this course. Mathematical modeling (deriving a mathematical expression from real-world data) is introduced, and students do experiments and use graphing calculators to gather information. Students purchase a course-specific graphing calculator and are instructed in its use. Algebraic skills are practiced within the context of solving problems, and geometric interpretations and graphing are emphasized. Students continue the study of linear and quadratic equations begun in Math I and Math II, adding new functions to their repertoire: polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms. This course is offered at two levels: Math IlIA and Math III. Both are college preparatory and cover functions and applications. Math IIIA is accelerated, covering topics usually included in algebra honors, trigonometry and precalculus. It prepares students for Level IIC of the College Board SAT Subject Test in Mathematics. Math III covers topics normally taught in advanced algebra and trigonometry.\n\nMath Analysis & Intro Calculus\n\nThis course begins with material from pre-calculus, including a study of functions (polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric) and their graphs. It continues with topics in analytic geometry, linear algebra, vectors and discrete mathematics. The course introduces topics from calculus, such as limits, continuity and derivatives and their applications. Students learn the material through lecture, group work, and homework.\n\nApplied Math\n\nThis\ncourse explores topics across a broad spectrum, including pre-calculus,\ncalculus, economics, finance, and statistics. The emphasis will be on\napplications of mathematics to a variety of fields. In the first semester, we\nwill introduce some of the ideas of set theory, statistics (linear regression\nmodels), economics (supply, demand) and finance (including simple and compound\ninterest). Second semester, we will continue with more finance (annuities and\nloan amortization), probability, single variable statistics (normal curve\ndistributions) and calculus (limits, rates of change, derivatives, and\nintegrals). The goal is to expose students to a variety of techniques and\napplications that will be useful in diverse academic pursuits as well as life\nin general.\n\nMath V: AP Calculus\n\nThis two-semester course covers differential and integral calculus at the college level. There are two versions. Math VAB is the basic course, covering techniques and applications of derivatives and integrals. It prepares students for the \"AB\" Advanced Placement Examination. Designed for the strongest math students, Math VBC covers the same material, as well as topics like infinite series and multivariable calculus and prepares students for the \"BC\" Advanced Placement Examination. The department advises students on which course to take based on their previous math work at College Prep. VBC is not recommended for students receiving lower than an A- in Math Analysis and Introduction to Calculus.\n\nAP Statistics\n\nHow accurate are opinion polls? Where is the economy really heading? Can you believe the latest \"study\" about health and diet? The media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is. In Statistics, we look at how data are gathered and presented, and how certain the conclusions drawn from them are likely to be. This means using standard formulas, but we will also look at the math behind the formulas, including probability and its applications. There are lab exercises (sometimes with edible \"equipment\") and mini-projects in which students design and carry out original investigations. There are also informal discussions of items in the news. This two-semester course is equivalent to a semester of statistics in college and prepares students for the AP exam. It may be taken after or at the same time as Applied Math, or Math Analysis and Introductory Calculus.\n\nThe Art of Problem Solving\n\nHigh\nschool math includes many beautiful topics, but there is so much more math that\nis accessible to bright and curious high school students like you that we don't\ninclude in our curriculum. There just isn't time to do it all. For those of you\nhungry for more math, The Art of Problem Solving is for you. It is a\none-semester math elective which will cover topics in arithmetic, number\ntheory, and counting and probability, as well as some algebra and geometry that\nisn't already covered in Math I, II, or III/IIIA. Students must have completed\nMath III/IIIA or equivalent to enroll. You don't have to like math contests to\ntake this course, but if you do like them, this course might help you improve\nyour scores. However, the best reason to take this course is that you will\nlearn new math, and equally importantly, it will be interesting and fun.\n\nCourse Spotlight\n\nAP Statistics\n\nHow accurate are opinion polls?\n\nWhere is the economy really heading?\n\nCan you believe the latest \"study\" about health and diet?\n\nThe media appear to give definitive answers to questions like these, without examining how strong or weak the evidence really is.

{"text":"This book is a first introduction to linear algebra for students majoring in scientific, engineering and social science disciplines. It stresses both practical computation and theoretical principles, and proceeds at a very leisurely pace. One of its characteristic features is that it deals with systems of linear equations at an early stage and uses this theory for the introduction of later techniques and for the proofs of most of the usual vector space theorems. Vector spaces are initially introduced in terms of ${\\bbfR}\\sp n$, a later chapter gives a more formal treatment. This results in a fair amount of repetition but enables one to choose between a more elementary or more advanced course. The authors have included sections on applications such as difference equations, differential equations, interpolation and least squares approximation, and each chapter includes extensive exercise sections. For the second edition much of the material has been extended and the layout of the text has been improved. There is a new section on linear transformations, and an instructor's manual and a student solutions manual are now available.\nReviewer:\nR.von Randow","id":"/679","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.96052086353302,"__label__0":0.039499182254076004}}

California Standards for Geometry will be taught throughout the year. See website  for current state standards. 3. Textbook: GEOMETRY by McDougal Littell (blue book) Textbook must be covered, returned in good condition, and cared for while on loan to the student. BRING YOUR BOOK TO CLASS EVERY DAY!!! 4. Grading System: All assignments are expected to be done neatly, on time, and honestly. a. Overall grade is calculated as a weighted average, described below. Homework 10% - must be done completely, with work shown, and turned in on time. Late homework (1 day) will be accepted at half-credit. HOMEWORK IS ASSIGNED FREQUENTLY! Participation 10% - notes, supplies, cooperation, class participation, projects, classwork. Quizzes 30% - Twice a week, usually. Often announced, sometimes unannounced (pop quiz) Tests 50% - All tests will be announced. Passing grade for tests, quizzes and the class is 60%. *************************************************************************** * To be eligible to take the chapter tests, a student must have all homework turned in * * before the test day. Any student who chooses to avoid his/her homework will be * * expected to complete their homework during the test, and MAKE UP THE TEST DURING * * BARK PERIOD. * *************************************************************************** b. Calculation of overall grade 95% - 100% = A+ 75% - 79% = C+ 90% - 94% = A 70% - 74% = C 85% - 90% = B+ 65% - 69% = D+ - avoid this!! 80% - 84 % = B 60% - 64% = D - avoid this!! Below 60% is failing, and will receive an F c. Make-up work for EXCUSED absences - must be done within a \"reasonable\" amount of time - Typically, one day of make-up time for each day of absence. It is the student's responsibility to get any missed notes from a classmate. Missed exams or quizzes must be made up within one week. The student is expected to pursue and complete all missing assignments. Those not made up within the stated time frame will receive a score of Zero. d. ZANGLE and Student Connect. I post grades regularly on Zangle – usually within a week. e. Cheating Policy (VUSD) A student who attempts to or gains an unfair advantage over any other student because of unacceptable behavior is subject to the following: Level One - zero on the assignment or test, conference with the student, contact the parent and send copy of form B to both parent and the Assistant Principal Level Two - zero on the assignment, 2 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Three - zero on the assignment, 5 day suspension by the Assistant Principal, notify parent with Form C, parent conference Level Four – Student shall be transferred from the high school and placed in alternative placement 5. Rules and Expectations. My rules are fairly simple – RESPECT for all - This means treat others how you wish to be treated. Use appropriate language and tone. Respect property – DO YOUR BEST. What you get from this class depends largely on what you put into it! – SEEK RESOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS - don't ignore them, they could get worse. – FOLLOW CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS Students will be expected to · Be in their seatwhen the tardy bell rings, with BOOK, supplies, ready to begin · Participate in all class work. Stay focused. · Pay attention, take notes during instruction, and ask questions · Keep all electronic distractions in their backpacks. CD players, video games and cell phones will be turned over to their administrator if used during class · Stay in assigned seat until dismissed. -TARDY It is important to be on time and prepared for class when the bell rings. I keep track of tardy arrivals; you will be expected to serve a class detention for your tardies. 6. Consequences Failure to meet the above rules and expectations will result in disciplinary action, according to school policy. (Verbal reminder, conference, removal of privilege, phone call to Parents, counseling referral, administrative referral.) 7. SUPPLIES – to be well prepared, please bring to class ●A 3-ring binder: 2 inches is best. You'll be getting lots of papers. ●Dividers – separate notebook into Notes/Homework/Journals/Quizzes/Extra Paper ●Loose leaf paper ●Graph paper ●Pencils! # 2 pencils, an eraser and colored pencils (pens are not for math) ●Highlighters ●Book Cover – not the adhesive kind ●a Compass and Protractor ●A scientific calculator.

{"text":"what is pre-algebra?\n\nAt least, he's taking the same course I took in 9th grade lo these many years ago. IIRC\n\nEd seems to remember it all better than I do, and he says the same thing. Christopher is studying the stuff he studied as a freshman in high school.\n\nWhat is pre-algebra, anyway?\n\nDo we know?\n\nThere wasn't any pre-algebra when I was a kid, and I remember Carolyn expressing skepticism about the whole concept back when we first met.\n\nThese days I think pre-algebra is simply Year One in a 3-year Algebra Spiral. You teach Algebra 1 in 6th grade, calling it Pre-Algebra; then you teach Algebra 1 again in 7th grade; then you teach it again in 8th.\n\nThat's the fast track.\n\nFor the slow track you start teaching Algebra 1 in 7th or 8th, calling it Pre-Algebra; then you teach it again for the next two years running.\n\nalgebra without the story problems\n\nMy other theory is that Pre-Algebra is Algebra 1 without the story problems.\n\nAlgebra 1 without the story problems is, IMO, a REALLY bad idea, but that's a subject for another post.\n\nPre-algebra is simply arithmetic with one new feature: we use letters to represent numbers. Because the letters are simply stand-ins for numbers, arithmetic is carried out exactly as it is with numbers. In particular, the arithmetic properties (commutative, associative, distributive) hold because we are still doing arithmetic with numbers. Thus the identity\n\n3(x + 1) = 3x + 3\n\nholds because we know that it is true when x = 2, when x = 5, and in fact when x is any number at all.\n\nThat's it — that's all there is to prealgebra from a purely mathematical standpoint. Later, when students progress to Algebra, this basic idea is used to define functions; as algebra continues it becomes increasingly focused on functions. The purpose of prealgebra is to prepare students for variables and functions without actually mentioning them. It is a crucial topic in the middle grades.\n\n*This is the 'grade A' review for SRA Math, the series Irvington abandoned for TRAILBLAZERS, on mathematicallycorrect. There's a dissenting review by David Klein & Jennifer Marple, (pdf file) also on mathematically correct, saying Saxon is better. Speaking of confusion, I had a memory of mathematicallycorrect reporting that Prentice-Hall Pre-Algebra had been adopted by CA; then a week ago I found a page there saying it had been rejected. Apparently I was right the first time. Was it accepted in one cycle & rejected in another? Don't know.\n\nAlgebra is a branch of mathematics which studies structure and quantity. It may be roughly characterized as a generalization and abstraction of arithmetic, in which operations are performed on symbols rather than numbers. It includes elementary algebra, taught to high school students, as well as abstract algebra which covers such structures as groups, rings and fields. Along with geometry and analysis, it is one of the three main branches of mathematics.\n\nSo the pre-algebra course overlaps with algebra to the extent that operations are performed on symbols rather than numbers.\n\nI think pre-algebra is just a name that's been stuck on a course regardless of whether it makes perfect logical sense or not.\n\nThe LA Times is running a story about the high rate of High School dropouts in the LAUSD.\n\nBelow are excerpts from their second article -- on the algebra requirement.\n\nThe whole series is avaailable at  but may require site registration.\n\nJanuary 30, 2006\nTHE VANISHING CLASS\nA Formula for Failure in L.A. Schools\nBy Duke Helfand, Times Staff Writer\n\nEach morning, when Gabriela Ocampo looked up at the chalkboard in her ninth-grade algebra class, her spirits sank.\nGabriela failed that first semester of freshman algebra. She failed again and again — six times in six semesters. And because students in Los Angeles Unified schools must pass algebra to graduate, her hopes for a diploma grew dimmer with each F.\n\n\"It triggers dropouts more than any single subject,\" said Los Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer. \"I think it is a cumulative failure of our ability to teach math adequately in the public school system.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2004, 48,000 ninth-graders took beginning algebra; 44% flunked, nearly twice the failure rate as in English. Seventeen percent finished with Ds.\n\nAmong those who repeated the class in the spring, nearly three-quarters flunked again.\n\nThe school district could have seen this coming if officials had looked at the huge numbers of high school students failing basic math.\n\nDiscouragement, Frustration\n\nBirmingham High in Van Nuys......has a failure rate that's about average for the district. Nearly half the ninth-grade class flunked beginning algebra last year.\n\nIn the spring semester alone, more freshmen failed than passed. The tally: 367 Fs and 355 passes, nearly one-third of them Ds.\n\nLike other schools in the nation's second-largest district, Birmingham High deals with failing students by shuttling them back into algebra, often with the same teachers.\n\nLast fall, the school scheduled 17 classes of up to 40 students each for those repeating first-semester algebra.\n\nThe strategy has also failed to provide students with what they need most: a review of basic math.\n\nTeachers complain that they have no time for remediation, that the rapid pace mandated by the district leaves behind students like Tina Norwood, 15, who is failing beginning algebra for the third time.\n\nTina, who says math has mystified her since she first saw fractions in elementary school, spends class time writing in her journal, chatting with friends or snapping pictures of herself with her cellphone.\n\nHer teacher, George Seidel, devoted a class this fall to reviewing equations with a single variable, such as x -- 1 = 36. It's the type of lesson students were supposed to have mastered in fourth grade.\n\n\"I got through a year of Vietnam,\" he said, \"so I tell myself every day I can get through 53 minutes of fifth period…. I don't know if I am making a difference with a single kid.\"\n\nEager to close this competitive chasm, education and business leaders in California sought to re-engineer the state's approach to math. They produced new math standards they believed would foster a \"rising tide of excellence.\"\n\nThis meant teaching algebra earlier, as soon as eighth grade for some students, even if instructors questioned whether younger students could handle abstract concepts.\n'I Give Up'\n\nWhether requiring all students to pass algebra is a good idea or not, two things are clear: Schools have not been equipped to teach it, and students have not been equipped to learn it.\n\nSecondary schools have had to rapidly expand algebra classes despite a shortage of credentialed math teachers.\n\nThe Center for the Future of Teaching & Learning in Santa Cruz found that more than 40% of eighth-grade algebra teachers in California lack a math credential or are teaching outside their field of expertise; more than 20% of high school math teachers are similarly unprepared.\n\nHigh school math instructors, meanwhile, face crowded classes of 40 or more students — some of whom do not know their multiplication tables or how to add fractions or convert percentages into decimals.\n\nBirmingham teacher Steve Kofahl said many students don't understand that X can be an abstract variable in an equation and not just a letter of the alphabet.\n\nBirmingham math coach Kathy De Soto said she was surprised to find something else: students who still count on their fingers.\n\nHigh school teachers blame middle schools for churning out ill-prepared students. The middle schools blame the elementary schools, where teachers are expected to have a command of all subjects but sometimes are shaky in math themselves.\n\nAt Cal State Northridge, the largest supplier of new teachers to Los Angeles Unified, 35% of future elementary school instructors earned Ds or Fs in their first college-level math class last year.\n\nSome of these students had already taken remedial classes that reviewed high school algebra and geometry.\n\n\"I give up. I'm not good at math,\" said sophomore Alexa Ganz, 19, who received a D in math last semester even after taking two remedial courses. \"I think I've been more confused this semester than helped.\"\n\nGanz, who wants to teach third grade, thinks the required math courses are overkill. \"I guarantee I won't need to know all this,\" she said, perhaps not realizing that if she were to teach in a public school, she could be bumped as a newcomer to upper grade levels that demand greater math knowledge.\n\nAdministrators in L.A. Unified say they are trying to reverse the alarming failure rates of high school students by changing the way math is taught, starting in elementary schools.\n\nThe new approach stresses conceptual lessons rather than rote memorization, a change that some instructors think is wrong. New math coaches also are training teachers and coordinating lesson plans at many schools.\n\nThe simplest algebraic concepts are now taught — or are supposed to be taught — beginning in kindergarten.\n\nSearching for a solution in its secondary schools, L.A. Unified is investing millions of dollars in new computer programs that teach pre-algebra, algebra and other skills.\n\nOfficials are considering other costly changes, including reducing the size of algebra classes to 25, launching algebra readiness classes for lagging eighth-graders and creating summer programs for students needing a kick-start before middle school or high school.\nGo figure\n\nAlgebra test\n\nA majority of ninth-graders in Los Angeles fail algebra or pass with a D grade.\n\nA copy of the LAUSD pacing plan for \"Algebra I: Structure and Method\" is included at the end of this letter. It undermines the organization of ideas in this textbook, and it undermines the California Mathematics Framework and Standards. We illustrate with some examples.\n\nThe two year pacing plan for \"Structure and Method\" calls for the quadratic formula together with completing the square of quadratic polynomials (in Chapter 12 of the textbook) to be explained to students before basic factoring techniques for polynomials (in Chapter 5), and before an introduction to radicals, including techniques for simplifying radicals (in Chapter 11). This choice of ordering of topics is so mathematically unsound that it will most likely seriously undermine the ability of LAUSD math teachers to teach algebra in a coherent and meaningful way. It will reduce the learning of algebra to memorizing meaningless formulas without understanding. In the words of the chairman of the Math Department of San Pedro High School (in LAUSD), Richard Wagoner:\n\n\"First and foremost among the problems with the Pacing Plan is that\nit renders the textbook and all support materials useless and obsolete.\nThe sequence is so seemingly random that students must jump back and\nforth between sections of chapters through most of the course.\nTherefore, all review materials, diagnostic tests, supplementary\nmaterials and enriched materials -- all of which are tied to the\nsequence as designed by the authors -- can no longer be used.\"\n\nTeacher George Seidel left a 25-year law career two years ago, hoping to find fulfillment as a teacher at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. \"I got through a year of Vietnam,\" he says, \"so I tell myself I can get through 53 minutes of period five.... I don't know if I am making a difference with a single kid.\"\n\nOfficials are considering other costly changes, including reducing the size of algebra classes to 25, launching algebra readiness classes for lagging eighth-graders and creating summer programs for students needing a kick-start before middle school or high school. Go figure\n\nSeems like they're trying everything but what works -- teaching elementary math to mastery before teaching algebraic concepts. It is exeedingly difficult to be this wrong accidentally.\n\nAfter viewing the photo gallary, I just want to say OMG. This article should be sent to every school board member pushing for \"fuzzy\" math.\n\nI am a homeschooler, so I don't have a dog in this fight, but ISeeing students in these photos who have been academically-abused for the first 8 years of their school lives just floors me. Really, this country doesn't need to worry about terrorist, we are destroying our country from the inside out.\n\nI look at those pictures and captions and everything points to how grades K-8 failed these kids. Lower schools do not want to hold kids back. One reason given for this is some study showing a higher drop-out rate for those kids who were held back. Duh! Keep passing them right along and you will have a 100% graduation rate.\n\nAt our public schools, they use the concepts of developmentally appropriate, full inclusion, and spiraling to justify this approach. They don't want classes/subjects to be filters. However, the filters are delayed until high school so they never see the product of their work. It's easy enough to blame the child, the parent, or society. By eighth grade many kids will decide that they are just not good in math, thereby completely letting the lower schools off the hook. High schools let the lower schools off the hook. They should be yelling and screaming at the lower schools.\n\nMy reaction is to tell people to look at the state tests and tell me what is so difficult that schools cannot succeed for most kids no matter what their parents or society does.\n\nI(I'M WRITING COMMENT TO POST AS A KEY WORD SO I CAN FIND THIS AGAIN)\n\nI had no idea homeschoolers didn't struggle over finding a math curriculum.\n\nOf course, I didn't struggle.\n\nThere were two choices (that I knew of at the time), and I made the choice quickly once I saw both.\n\nHere are all these teachers AND students saying 'He still counts on his fingers' — how can anyone NOT take seriously the absolute need to learn the procedures and algorithms of elementary math COLD.\n\nMy kindergarten aged son gets embarrassed when he has to resort to counting on his fingers to solve an addition or subtraction problem. You think these kids don't know that thye're not supposed to be counting on their fingers in high school? I'm sure this is all part of the low self-esteem problem you get when you you can't do math.\n\nWhen you're working efficiently at your child's pace, rather than at the pace of the class & the school with its many holidays & moments of lost instructional time, I think it would be easy to get through one Saxon book & two Singapore books each school year K-5 or even K-8.\n\nBecause these kids - these young adults - really are suffering. You can see it in their body language.\n\nThis didn't need to happen aren know.\n\nBecause we are looking at pain.\n\nThese young people break my heart.\n\nEvery one of these young people can solve an equation like\n\n3x + 2 = 32\n\nChristopher may be able to do that now.\n\nIF CHRISTOPHER WERE USING SAXON MATH HE'D BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH EASE.\n\nThe only reason Christopher has found equations like this one hard is that the course moves way too fast with way too little practice.\n\nI suppose the crafty teacher could secretly teach elementary math in class instead of algebra. It's not like these kids are in any condition to pass algebra anyway. Of course, thne this teacher looks bad since his students are all failing algebra and some other teacher will get all the glory when they ultimately pass algebra arenBut what is it?\n................\n\nMy MIL taught math to middle school kids for 25 years. She.\n\nShe\n\n\"Most students who enter my eighth-grade Algebra I or Honors Algebra I classes in September each year are ill-prepared to learn algebra because most of them have not fully mastered arithmetic. To make matters worse, I have too few class periods to teach them the entire rigorous course when one adds up the drug education activities, annual class trips, report card day, vacations, snow days, exams, and parent-teacher conferences. These restrictions demand that the students put in extensive quality time outside of class grappling with difficult problems and practicing for accuracy.\n\nThey really should only count full days with the teacher when they're adding up the 180 days of school required. It would probably shock parents how few days in the year are actually spent with their teacher learning about core subjects.\n\n\"It would probably shock parents how few days in the year are actually spent with their teacher learning about core subjects.\"\n\nEven with the teacher instructional time is a shrinking commodity. The first activity of the day is handing out meal ticket. That often takes half an hour of prime time. I've known teachers who schedule an hour of SSR in the morning. More prime time lost. Then you have the dogma of non-instruction under the constructivist regime.

{"text":"Solving\nequations\n\nOnce we can solve quadratic equations and simultaneous equations it is tempting to think that we will be able to solve more and more complicated equations by using the same principles but its not always that simple. The\nquadratic equation:\n\na\nx² + b x + c = 0\n\ncan\nbe solved using a formula but most polynomial equations don't have\nformulas to give the solution. Every polynomial with only real or complex coefficients has a complex number solution , this is the fundamental theorem of algebra, but they cannot always be expressed exactly with radicals. To find an approximation to the solution we may have to use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or Laguerre method.\n\nGeneralised reciprocity laws are very\ncomplicated algorithms that enable you to get crucial information\nabout some of these more complicated equations. In favorable\ncircumstances, they can be used to prove deep statements about the\nsolution sets of algebraic equations.\n\nAn\nequation does not have to be too complicated to lack a formula, for\nexample:\n\nx5 - x + 1 = 0\n\nNumbers\n\n- Real\nnumbers - numbers which are continuous such as when we are representing points along a line - On this site I will sometimes use the term 'Scalar' to mean 'Real' numbers although strictly the term should be used when scaling a vector - In computer programs real numbers have a finite length and may have decimal point and/or exponent this allows us to approximate most real numbers but it is only an approximation.\n\nSet Definition\n\nFunction Definition\n\nA\nfunction from a set A to a set B is a rule that assigns to each\nelement in A an element of B. If f is the name of the function and a is an element of A then we write f(a) to mean the\nelement of B that is assigned to a. A function f is often written as f: A →B.\n\nWhere I can, I have put links to Amazon for books that are relevant to\nthe subject, click on the appropriate country flag to get more details\nof the book or to buy it from them.\n\nFearless Symmetry - This\nbook approaches symmetry from the point of view of number theory. It\nmay not be for you if you are only interested in the geometrical\naspects of symmetry such as rotation groups but if you are interested\nin subjects like modulo n numbers, Galois theory, Fermats last\ntheorem, to name a few topics the chances are you will find this book\ninteresting. It is written in a friendly style for a general audience\nbut I did not find it dumbed down. I found a lot of new concepts to\nlearn.

{"text":"Fourier Series Concept Visualization Tools\n\nChris Long\n\nFor many students the concepts associated with Fourier series can be difficult to comprehend. Two of those concepts are the principle of superposition and the relationship between the time and frequency domains. At Purdue South Bend, Professor Gene Harding and undergraduate student Chris Long worked together using MATLAB to create a pair of visualization tools for illustrating these concepts.

{"text":"Because of its large command structure and intricate syntax, Mathematica can be difficult to learn. Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\"This book is a comprehensive package for knowledge sharing on Mathematics. The language of the book is simple and self-explanatory, this will help the students to grasp the fundamentals of the subject easily. The book follows a to the point approach and lays stress on the understanding of the core concepts. Appropriate number of MCQs are given for each topic that are of great help to the students appearing for competitive and State Board examinations.\"\"\n\n \" . . . [a] treasure house of material for students and teachers alike . . . can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic.\" --London Times Higher Education Supplement \"The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking.\" --SIAM Review \"Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards . . . to novelty . . . each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically.\" --Mathematical Reviews A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling provides in-depth and systematic coverage of the art and science of mathematical modelling. Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.\n\nMost texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data.\nAlthough the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.\n\nThe first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.\n\nDeveloped from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.\n\nAlthough the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation.\nA First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented.\nDeveloped from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.\n\nThe field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.\n\nRealizing the specific needs of first-year graduate students, this reference allows readers to grasp and master fundamental concepts in abstract algebra-establishing a clear understanding of basic linear algebra and number, group, and commutative ring theory and progressing to sophisticated discussions on Galois and Sylow theory, the structure of abelian groups, the Jordan canonical form, and linear transformations and their matrix representations.\n\nR is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields.\nDoing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive.\nA Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.\n\nWILEY-INTERSCIENCE PAPERBACK SERIESFrom the Reviews of History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750\"This is a marvelous book . . . Anyone with the slightest interest in the history of statistics, or in understanding how modern ideas have developed, will find this an invaluable resource.\"--Short Book Reviews of ISI\n\nBecause of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code.\nThe book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.","id":"/721","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9434678554534912,"__label__0":0.056552235037088394}}

{"text":"Published books of problems generally mean to nudge serious, dedicated and perhaps talented mathematics students towards a research-oriented frame of mind. If you really mean a bound problem collection for general education, I expect you will have to write such a book yourself. But I would probably recommend against publishing such a book - on the grounds: don't teach until you see the whites of their eyes. A mathematics problem that will work with one cohort might variously and unpredictably either defeat or insult the intelligence of another. And, as the the response to your other question might indicate, teachers of mathematics will have very diverse views of what constitute a value partial knowledge of mathematics.\n\nThat said, if I had an audience of highly intelligent but not especially mathematically oriented students, I might focus their \"last look\" at mathematics on Lawvere and Schanuel's Conceptual Mathematics (which has many good problems). The authors show themselves as both wise and smart. While the book could save the soul of a stray mathematician, it does not harbor any hidden agenda that means ignoring the needs of the broader audience. And while it might accidentally remediate some high school induces confusions, even the best trained students will find most of what the authors say both very new and very fundamental.\n\nSerge Lang's Math Talks for Undergraduate also attracts me, but where Lawvere and Schanuel help a student think about the larger world in a more mathematical way, Lang wants non-mathematicians to understand more about what mathematicians do.\n\nResearch mathematician/teachers generally hold as a sacred shibboleth the dictum that \"mathematics in not a spectator sport.\" In the case of a class of general education students seeing mathematics in the classroom for the last time, and and the risk of blasphemy, I question this, I question whether having these students primarily trying to solve problems for themselves necessarily constitutes the best use of their time. I believe that the mathematics community has neglected developing of literature of what one might call proof-oriented spectator mathematics. But still I might recommend a book: I taught a course recently out of Ross Honsberger's Episodes in 19th and 20th Century Euclidean Geometry where I focused on close readings of complicated but elementary proofs of concrete and yet often spectacularly counter-intuitive facts, all material most mathematics majors will never see on the grounds that it isn't sufficiently modern.

The latter is\nreally for people aged 16-18, but smart school students often discuss university mathematics.\n\nDiscussions worth reading Over at Cambridge, Tim Gowers is introducing a new feature this year,\nhis Weblog.\nWhile it will be tailored to his first year lectures at his university, I expect we will all learn a thing\nor two from Tim. There are Terry Tao's\nmaths quizzes, which seem to\nbe very attractive aids to learning pure maths in general (not just\nfor this course). Both Terry\nand Tim\nhave Fields Medals (these are like Nobel\nprizes, but for clever people).\n\nTimetable Here is the\ncourse timetable.\nFor this course, Lectures (and Problem Classes) are at\nTuesday 9:15 University Hall,\nThursday 16:15 University Hall\nand Friday 12:15 (Problem Class) University Hall.\n\nThe Mathematics Department has set up drop-in Workshops to advise students\non this course (and others). These are\n14:15 -- 16:05 Monday 1W4.40,\n10:15 -- 12:05 Tuesday 1W4.40\nand 17:15 -- 19:05 1W4.40.\nYou can drop in to any of them for as long, or as short, as you wish.\nThe workshops will not run in Week 1 but\nour Algebra 1A tutorials will run in week 1.\nThere are also drop-in help sessions organized by MASH.\nThese are on Tuesday 14:15 -- 16:05 in 1W2.5,\nWednesday 13:15 -- 15:05 in 1W3.15\nand Thursday 13:15 -- 15:05 in 4W1.7. Please let me know if any of this information is broken.\n\nFeedback The best way to get feedback on your progress is via your tutor. Hand-in work by the specified\ntime and date in the relevant 4W level 1 slot. Your tutor will comment on your work, which should be returned\nto you about a week later. It is a crime to go to a tutorial without having tried the problems\non the current sheet. It is also a crime to go to a tutorial without knowing the meaning of every word\nused on the problem sheet (since if you do not understand the words, you will not understand the questions).\nIt is most definitely not a crime to be stuck, confused or bamboozled, and your tutor should be able to help you there.\nDo not ask your tutor to show you how to do the problems. Rather your tutor should help you understand the problems\nwith sufficient insight that you can do some of the problems yourself. Problems come in varying levels of difficulty,\nand it would be an extraordinary student who could regularly do them all.\nWhat do you do if you think I have made an error in lectures, on a question sheet or on a solution sheet? Well, first check if someone else agrees with you. Then if so, send me an e-mail with the relevant information.\n\nLecturer's Lecture Notes These are in my head, and therefore cannot be borrowed. If you miss a lecture or lectures, then borrow a set of notes from a reliable scribe, and copy them up by hand or photocopying machine.\n\nProblem Sheet Solutions Written solutions will be put up at this site\nafter the work has been handed in.\n\nLecture 1Boole's rules\nare here. Problem Sheet 1. In this lecture we made three definitions and introduced\nsome notation. We defined the notion of a set, and wrote\nx ∈ A to mean that x is an element of the set A.\nWe defined the notion of a subset, and wrote A ⊆ B.\nWe decided to write A = B when both A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.\nIt follows that there is a unique set with no elements,\nso we can apply the definite article to the empty set ø.\nThe set of natural numbers is ℕ,\nthe set of integers is ℤ,\nthe set of rational numbers is ℚ,\nthe set of real numbers is ℝ and the set of complex numbers is ℂ.\nWe introduced interval notation (a,b), [a,b], (a, b] and [a,b].\nThus, for example, (1,2) = { x | x ∈ ℝ, 1 < x, x < 2}.\nFinally I asked if there was a collection of open intervals with the property\nthat the intersection of each pair is not the empty set, but the intersection\nof the whole collection is the empty set. Incidentally, I spent\nlast Sunday marking the 2012 UK\nMathematical Olympiad for Girls.\n\nLecture 2 We introduced more notation, including that\nfor intersection and union. We discussed Boole's rules\nat some length, including De Morgan's laws. We began to discuss maps.\nA dark warning was issued against allowing\nthe set\nof all sets to be a set, for Bertrand Russell is waiting for the\nunwary, and will hit you with a\nparadox if\nyou do that. Note the quality of the\nmoustache.\n\nLecture 3 We introduced the identity map on a set, and constant\nmaps. We defined composition of maps, and showed that\ncomposition of maps, where defined, is an associative process.\nWe defined injective, surjective and bijective maps.\nWe proved that each of these last three types of map\nis closed under map composition (Proposition 10).\nHere is Problem Sheet 2,\ndue in on Monday October 17.\n\nHere are\nSolutions to sheet 1. Note the use of the \"maps to\" symbol, a right arrow\nwith a short vertical tail. This is used to describe how a map acts.\nThus f: x |-> x^2 means the same as f(x) = x^2. Sorry about the home made symbols, I am still looking for the way to display the \"maps to\" symbol in html.\nThis is not the same symbol as the right arrow which sits between the\ndomain and codomain of a map.\n\nLecture 4\nWe characterized injections, surjections and bijections between\nnon-empty sets in terms of the existence of left, respectively right, respectively (unique) two sided inverses. We introduced the notion of the power\nset of a set. We showed that if A is a finite set, then |P(A)| = 2n.\nWe began the proof that for any set B, there is no bijection between B and\nP(B).\n\nLecture 5.\nWe finished the proof mentioned above. We proved that there is a bijection between\nthe natural numbers and the integers. We proved that if S is an infinite subset of\nthe natural numbers, then there is a bijection between S and the natural numbers.\nWe proved that there is a bijection between the set of ordered pairs of natural numbers\nand the natural numbers. We stated (but will not prove) that if A and B are sets, then either\nthere is an injection from A to B, or there is an injection from B to A (or possibly both).\nWe also stated, but will not prove in lectures, the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem, that\nif A and B are sets, and there are injections both from A to B, and from B to A, then\nthere is a bijection between A and B.\nProblem Sheet 3 and\nSheet 2 Solutions.\n\nLecture 6 We defined countability: a set S is countable\nif (and only if) there is an injection f : S → ℕ\nWe proved that the set ℚ of rational numbers is (infinite) countable.\nWe used Cantor's diagonal argument to show that\nthe real interval [0,1/2] is not countable, and so\nℝ is not countable. Note that there was a typo (chalko?) in\nthe diagonal argument. At one point I wrote yi\nwhen I should have written yii.\n\nLecture 7 Here are\nnotes v2 on partitions and equivalence relations.\nhere are the changes to version 1 in case you have it. First line, R is a subset of S X S, not R is a subset of S.\nIn \"Properties of Relations\", the erroneous spelling reflextive was eliminated. In Examples of Partitions (iii), change \"for\" to \"form\".\nIn Examples of Equivalence Relations (ii), insert the missing comma after the word \"sets\". In the discussion after teh Examples of Transversals,\ncorrect the mangled spelling of \"equivalence\". In teh final part on scary notation, change [3] to [2].\n\nAt the Problems Class on Friday October 19 2012, a student called Miles\nproposed a better solution to Sheet 2, problem 8(d), than the one\nwhich I had suggested in the solutions sheet.\n\nLecture 8 We started number theory. We defined prime numbers, and proved that there are infinitely many of\nthem. We defined coprimality, and we showed that if m and n are integers and not both 0, then\nthe smallest positive integer g expressible as rm + sn (with integers r and s) is the greatest common divisor of\nm and n, and moreover that every common divisor of m and n will divide g.\nWe stated the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that every positive integer greater than 1\nis the product of prime numbers in a (more or less) unique way. We got as far as proving the existence of\nsuch a factorization, and will address uniqueness in the lecture on Thursday.\nThis note addresses\nthe chalko in Euclid's proof, and the matter of good housekeeping (induction) as promised in the\nlecture.\nHere are Sheet 3 Solutions.\n\nLecture 9 We completed the proof of Gauss's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.\nWe discussed how to\ncount the number of divisors of a natural number by\nlooking at its factorization into prime numbers. We compared the prime factorization of positive\nintegers m and n with their prime factorizations.\nWe discussed Euclid's algorithm, why it terminates, and why it gives the gcd of two positive integers as the output.\nHere is a question which has a nice answer: \"what is the sum of the divisors of 1000?\". You can do it in your head\n(provided that you are relaxed about multiplying a three-digit number by a two-digit number, and who isn't?).\n\nLecture 10 We endowed the integers mod n with well-defined\naddition and multiplication. We defined the notion of a group, and gave\nseveral examples. Here are some\nnotes\nwhich will assist you with Sheet 5, Questions 1 and 2 in particular,\nand life in general.\n\nThu Nov 8 Lecture 13 We introduced Euler's φ-function, and proved that it was multiplicative\nwith respect to coprime arguments (by exploiting the Chinese Remainder\nTheorem). We also proved that of f, g are polynomials in K[X]\nwhere K is a field, and g is not the zero polynomial,\nthen there are q, r in K[X] such\nthat f = qg + r and deg r < deg g. There were a couple of\nglitches. (i) In the proof that deg(f + g) ≤\nmax {deg f, deg g}, I wrote\n(al + bl)Xk+l but the exponent should\nbe l rather than k + l.\n(ii) Also in the calculation of φ(pk), the set being subtracted\nshould have been { tp | 0 ≤ t < pk-1} (and\nnot { tp | 0 ≤ t < p}).\n\nTue Nov 20 Lecture 16 More on linear maps and matrices. Small glitch\nin one proof. Fix to follow. How to invert a 2 by 2 real matrix (or indeed, any 2 by 2 matrix\nwith entries in a field). There was a glitch in the lecture, in (iii)\nwhere we were establishing that if the determinant of a real 2 by 2 matrix\nis 0, then it has no inverse. Here is a\nfix.\nHere is Problem Sheet 9Sheet 8 solutions.\n\nThu Nov 22 Lecture 17 The area/volume interpretation of determinants for 2 by 2 and 3 by 3\nmatrices with real entries.\n\nThu Dec 6 Lecture 20\nEach element of S_n is either an even permutation or an odd permutation,\nand no permutation is in both categories.

{"text":"Discrete Mathematics With Combinatorics\n\n9780130457912\n\nISBN:\n\n0130457914\n\nEdition: 2 Pub Date: 2003 Publisher: Prentice Hall PTR\n\nSummary: As in the first edition, the purpose of this book is to present an extensive range and depth of topics in discrete mathematics and also work in a theme on how to do proofs. Proofs are introduced in the first chapter and continue throughout the book. Most students taking discrete mathematics are mathematics and computer science majors. Although the necessity of learning to do proofs is obvious for mathematics majors, ...it is also critical for computer science students to think logically. Essentially, a logical bug-free computer program is equivalent to a logical proof. Also, it is assumed in this book that it is easier to use (or at least not misuse) an application if one understands why it works. With few exceptions, the book is self-contained. Concepts are developed mathematically before they are seen in an applied context. Additions and alterations in the second edition: More coverage of proofs, especially in Chapter 1. Added computer science applications, such as a greedy algorithm for coloring the nodes of a graph, a recursive algorithm for counting the number of nodes on a binary search tree, or an efficient algorithm for computinga b modnfor very large values ofa, b,andn. An extensive increase in the number of problems in the first eight chapters. More problems are included that involve proofs. Additional material is included on matrices. Inclusion of finite states with output and Turing machines. True-False questions at the end of each chapter. Summary questions at the end of each chapter. A glossary at the end of each chapter. Functions and sequences are introduced earlier (in Chapter 2). Calculus is not required for any of the material in this book. College algebra is adequate for the basic chapters. However, although this book is self-contained, some of the remaining chapters require more mathematical maturity than do the basic chapters, so calculus is recommended more for giving maturity, than for any direct uses. This book is intended for either a one- or two-term course in discrete mathematics. The first eight chapters of this book provide a foundation in discrete mathematics and would be appropriate for a first-level course for freshmen or sophomores. These chapters are essentially independent, so that the instructor can pick the material he/she wishes to cover. The remainder of the book contains appropriate material for a second course in discrete mathematics. These chapters expand concepts introduced earlier and introduce numerous advanced topics. Topics are explored from different points of view to show how they may be used in different settings. The range of topics include: Logic--Including truth tables, propositional logic, predicate calculus, circuits, induction, and proofs. Set Theory--Including cardinality of sets, relations, partially ordered sets, congruence relations, graphs, directed graphs, and functions. Algorithms--Including complexity of algorithms, search and sort algorithms, the Euclidean algorithm, Huffman's algorithm, Prim's algorithms, Warshall's algorithm, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithms. Graph Theory--Including directed graphs, Euler cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles and paths, planar graphs, and weighted graphs. Trees--including binary search trees, weighted trees, tree transversal, Huffman's codes, and spanning trees. Combinatorics--including permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion, partitions, generating functions, Catalan numbers, Sterling numbers, Rook Polynomials, derangements, and enumeration of colors. Algebra--Including semigroups, groups, lattices, semilattices, Boolean algebras, rings, fields, integral domains,[","id":"/732","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9525595903396606,"__label__0":0.04746037349104881}}
{"text":"Just because something doesn't teach everything about a subject doesn't make it a poor instructional aid. Algebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it. Even if you do understand it and could in principle recreate the rules from scratch, recalling them from memory is faster than deriving them each time you need them - and since algebra is pretty much the foundation of all advanced math, you'll be needing them a lot if you want to study math at all. (Though if you end up struggling with the harder topics because you didn't have the rules of algebra appropriately memorized, you might never want to study more of it...)\n\nAlgebra is more than rote memorization, but having the rules memorized does help a lot in getting to the stage where you truly understand it.\n\nI disagree. I think that memorizing the rules first, without understanding where they come from, discourages the student from attempting to understand anything to begin with. After all, his goal is to balance an equation, and look, he just balanced it... so what else is there to know ? Thus, the memorization approach creates the impression that math (or whatever subject you're studying) is all about arbitrary rules that make no sense; it's all about \"guessing the teacher's password\", and that's boring.\n\nContrast this with the approach of treating an equation like a puzzle. If \"2x - 3 = 5\", and we want to know what x is, there are many ways to approach the solution. We could ask, \"someone did a bunch of stuff to x to get 5, how can we undo it ?\", or we could say, \"the equation is like a pair of scales that are balanced, so what can we do to get x by itself without unbalancing the scales ?\", etc. Some possible partial answers are, \"someone took away 3, so let's add it back\", or \"if we add 3 to both sides, the scales will still be balanced but we'll be one step closer to a solution\". But \"add 3 to both sides because that's how the game is programmed and you won't get the high score otherwise\" isn't much of an answer. High scores don't mean anything, algebra does.\n\nWell, I can't speak for others, but my personal experience with math tends to be that I only start properly learning why something works once I have the rules pretty well memorized. Before that, my working memory is so occupied with trying to just remember how to apply the rules that I don't have the space to remember why they work. Or alternatively, I can learn why the rules work - but in that case I don't have the memory capacity left for remembering how to apply them.\n\nOf course, this is complicated by the fact that during the process of trying to memorize the rules, I often stop to think about why they work in an attempt to rederive them and make sure I'm not misremembering them. So it's not pure rote memorization, like the way it seems to be with DragonBox. But I would still expect that if somebody first learned them as meaningless rules in the game, and was then later taught math and the reasons for the rules, they'd have a good chance of being delighted at discovering where the rules came from, and could spend all of their cognitive capacity on developing an actual understanding.\n\nFair enough; it's possible that you and I simply think in different ways. I personally find it very difficult to memorize (seemingly) arbitrary rules, and I found it very difficult to un-teach the \"guess the teacher's password\" mentality to people. But it's quite likely that I'm making an unjustified generalization from a very small number of examples.","id":"/734","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9939688444137573,"__label__0":0.006051153875887394}}
{"text":"Matrices\n\nSummary: This chapter covers principles of matrices. After completing this chapter students should be able to: complete matrix operations; solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan method; Solve linear systems using the matrix inverse method and complete application problems.\n\nChapter Overview\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn to:\n\nDo matrix operations.\n\nSolve linear systems using the Gauss-Jordan method.\n\nSolve linear systems using the matrix inverse method.\n\nDo application problems.\n\nIntroduction to Matrices\n\nSection Overview\n\nIn this section you will learn to:\n\nAdd and subtract matrices.\n\nMultiply a matrix by a scalar.\n\nMultiply two matrices.\n\nA matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Matrices are useful in organizing and manipulating large amounts of data. In order to get some idea of what matrices are all about, we will look at the following example.\n\nExample 1\n\nProblem 1\n\nFine Furniture Company makes chairs and tables at its San Jose, Hayward, and Oakland factories. The total production, in hundreds, from the three factories for the years 1994 and 1995 is listed in the table below.\n\nTable 1\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\nChairs\n\nTables\n\nChairs\n\nTables\n\nSan Jose\n\n30\n\n18\n\n36\n\n20\n\nHayward\n\n20\n\n12\n\n24\n\n18\n\nOakland\n\n16\n\n10\n\n20\n\n12\n\nRepresent the production for the years 1994 and 1995 as the matrices A and B.\n\nFind the difference in sales between the years 1994 and 1995.\n\nThe company predicts that in the year 2000 the production at these factories will double that of the year 1994. What will the production be for the year 2000?\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to familiarize ourselves with some terms that are associated with matrices. The numbers in a matrix are called the entries or the elements of a matrix. Whenever we talk about a matrix, we need to know the size or the dimension of the matrix. The dimension of a matrix is the number of rows and columns it has. When we say a matrix is a 3 by 4 matrix, we are saying that it has 3 rows and 4 columns. The rows are always mentioned first and the columns second. This means that a\n3×43×4 size 12{3 times 4} {} matrix does not have the same dimension as a\n4×34×3 size 12{4 times 3} {} matrix. A matrix that has the same number of rows as columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with all entries zero is called a zero matrix. A square matrix with 1's along the main diagonal and zeros everywhere else, is called an identity matrix. When a square matrix is multiplied by an identity matrix of same size, the matrix remains the same. A matrix with only one row is called a row matrix or a row vector, and a matrix with only one column is called a column matrix or a column vector. Two matrices are equal if they have the same size and the corresponding entries are equal.\n\nMatrix Addition and Subtraction\n\nIf two matrices have the same size, they can be added or subtracted. The operations are performed on corresponding entries.\n\nTo multiply a matrix by another is not as easy as the addition, subtraction, or scalar multiplication of matrices. Because of its wide use in application problems, it is important that we learn it well. Therefore, we will try to learn the process in a step by step manner. We first begin by finding a product of a row matrix and a column matrix.\n\nSolution\n\nWe already know how to multiply a row matrix by a column matrix. To find the product\nABAB size 12{ ital \"AB\"} {}, in this example, we will be multiplying the row matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} to both the first and second columns of matrix\nBB size 12{B} {}, resulting in a\n1×21×2 size 12{1 times 2} {} matrix.\n\nWe have just multiplied a\n1×31×3 size 12{1 times 3} {} matrix by a matrix whose size is\n3×23×2 size 12{3 times 2} {}. So unlike addition and subtraction, it is possible to multiply two matrices with different dimensions as long as the number of entries in the rows of the first matrix are the same as the number of entries in columns of the second matrix.\n\nSolution\n\nThis time we are multiplying two rows of the matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} with two columns of the matrix\nBB size 12{B} {}. Since the number of entries in each row of\nAA size 12{A} {} are the same as the number of entries in each column of\nBB size 12{B} {}, the product is possible. We do exactly what we did in Example 6. The only difference is that the matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} has one more row.\n\nWe multiply the first row of the matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} with the two columns of\nBB size 12{B} {}, one at a time, and then repeat the process with the second row of\nAA size 12{A} {}. We get\n\nThe product\nFEFE size 12{ ital \"FE\"} {} is not possible because the matrix\nFF size 12{F} {} has two entries in each row, while the matrix\nEE size 12{E} {} has three entries in each column. In other words, the matrix\nFF size 12{F} {} has two columns, while the matrix\nEE size 12{E} {} has three rows.\n\nIn order for product\nABAB size 12{ ital \"AB\"} {} to exist, the number of columns of\nAA size 12{A} {}, must equal the number of rows of\nBB size 12{B} {}. If matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} is of dimension\nm×nm×n size 12{m times n} {} and\nBB size 12{B} {} of dimension\nn×pn×p size 12{n times p} {}, the product will have the dimension\nm×pm×p size 12{m times p} {}. Furthermore, matrix multiplication is not commutative.\n\nIn this chapter, we will be using matrices to solve linear systems. In Section 7, we will be asked to express linear systems as the matrix equation AX=BAX=B size 12{ ital \"AX\"=B} {}, where\nAA size 12{A} {},\nXX size 12{X} {}, and\nBB size 12{B} {} are matrices. The matrix\nAA size 12{A} {} is called the coefficient matrix.\n\nSystems of Linear Equations; Gauss-Jordan Method\n\nIn this section, we learn to solve systems of linear equations using a process called the Gauss-Jordan method. The process begins by first expressing the system as a matrix, and then reducing it to an equivalent system by simple row operations. The process is continued until the solution is obvious from the matrix. The matrix that represents the system is called the augmented matrix, and the arithmetic manipulation that is used to move from a system to a reduced equivalent system is called a row operation.\n\nExample 12\n\nProblem 1\n\nWrite the following system as an augmented matrix.\n\n2x+3y−4z=52x+3y−4z=5 size 12{2x+3y - 4z=5} {}\n\n(30)\n\n3x+4y−5z=−63x+4y−5z=−6 size 12{3x+4y - 5z= - 6} {}\n\n(31)\n\n4x+5y−6z=74x+5y−6z=7 size 12{4x+5y - 6z=7} {}\n\n(32)\n\nSolution\n\nWe express the above information in matrix form. Since a system is entirely determined by its coefficient matrix and by its matrix of constant terms, the augmented matrix will include only the coefficient matrix and the constant matrix. So the augmented matrix we get is as follows:\n\nIn the Section 2, we expressed the system of equations as\nAX=BAX=B size 12{ ital \"AX\"=B} {}, where\nAA size 12{A} {} represented the coefficient matrix, and\nBB size 12{B} {} the matrix of constant terms. As an augmented matrix, we write the matrix as\nA∣BA∣B size 12{ left [A \\lline B right ]} {}. It is clear that all of the information is maintained in this matrix form, and only the letters\nxx size 12{x} {},\nyy size 12{y} {} and\nzz size 12{z} {} are missing. A student may choose to write\nxx size 12{x} {},\nyy size 12{y} {} and\nzz size 12{z} {} on top of the first three columns to help ease the transition.\n\nExample 13\n\nProblem 1\n\nFor the following augmented matrix, write the system of equations it represents.\n\nOnce a system is expressed as an augmented matrix, the Gauss-Jordan method reduces the system into a series of equivalent systems by employing the row operations. This row reduction continues until the system is expressed in what is called the reduced row echelon form. The reduced row echelon form of the coefficient matrix has 1's along the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The solution is readily obtained from this form.\n\nThe method is not much different form the algebraic operations we employed in the elimination method in the first chapter. The basic difference is that it is algorithmic in nature, and, therefore, can easily be programmed on a computer.\n\nWe will next solve a system of two equations with two unknowns, using the elimination method, and then show that the method is analogous to the Gauss-Jordan method.\n\nExample 14\n\nProblem 1\n\nSolve the following system by the elimination method.\n\nx+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}\n\n(38)\n\n3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y=\"11\"} {}\n\n(39)\n\nSolution\n\nWe multiply the first equation by – 3, and add it to the second equation.\n\nRow Operations\n\nOne can easily see that these three row operation may make the system look different, but they do not change the solution of the system.\n\nThe first row operation states that if any two rows of a system are interchanged, the new system obtained has the same solution as the old one. Let us look at an example in two equations with two unknowns. Consider the system\n\nx+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}\n\n(53)\n\n3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y=\"11\"} {}\n\n(54)\n\nWe interchange the rows, and we get,\n\n3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y=\"11\"} {}\n\n(55)\n\nx+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}\n\n(56)\n\nClearly, this system has the same solution as the one above.\n\nThe second operation states that if a row is multiplied by any non-zero constant, the new system obtained has the same solution as the old one. Consider the above system again,\n\nx+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}\n\n(57)\n\n3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y=\"11\"} {}\n\n(58)\n\nWe multiply the first row by –3, we get,\n\n-3x-9y=-21-3x-9y=-21\n\n(59)\n\n3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y=\"11\"} {}\n\n(60)\n\nAgain, it is obvious that this new system has the same solution as the original.\n\nThe third row operation states that any constant multiple of one row added to another preserves the solution. Consider our system,\n\nx+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}\n\n(61)\n\n3x+4y=113x+4y=11 size 12{3x+4y=\"11\"} {}\n\n(62)\n\nIf we multiply the first row by – 3, and add it to the second row, we get,\n\nx+3y=7x+3y=7 size 12{x+3y=7} {}\n\n(63)\n\n−5y=−10−5y=−10 size 12{ - 5y= - \"10\"} {}\n\n(64)\n\nAnd once again, the same solution is maintained.\n\nNow that we understand how the three row operations work, it is time to introduce the Gauss-Jordan method to solve systems of linear equations.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Gauss-Jordan method starts out with an augmented matrix, and by a series of row operations ends up with a matrix that is in the reduced row echelon form. A matrix is in the reduced row echelon form if the first nonzero entry in each row is a 1, and the columns containing these 1's have all other entries as zeros. The reduced row echelon form also requires that the leading entry in each row be to the right of the leading entry in the row above it, and the rows containing all zeros be moved down to the bottom.\n\nWe state the Gauss-Jordan method as follows.\n\nGauss-Jordan Method\n\nWrite the augmented matrix.\n\nInterchange rows if necessary to obtain a non-zero number in the first row, first column.\n\nUse a row operation to make the entry in the first row, first column, a 1.\n\nUse row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column one.\n\nInterchange rows if necessary to obtain a nonzero number in the second row, second column. Use a row operation to make this entry 1. Use row operations to make all other entries as zeros in column two.\n\nRepeat step 5 for row 3, column 3. Continue moving along the main diagonal until you reach the last row, or until the number is zero. The final matrix is called the reduced row-echelon form.\n\nWe want a 1 in row one, column one. This can be obtained by dividing the first row by 2, or interchanging the second row with the first. Interchanging the rows is a better choice because that way we avoid fractions.\n\nSo far we have made a 1 in the left corner and all other entries zeros in that column. Now we move to the next diagonal entry, row 2, column 2. We need to make this entry(–3) a 1 and make all other entries in this column zeros. To make row 2, column 2 entry a 1, we divide the entire second row by –3.\n\nBefore we leave this section, we mention some terms we may need in the fourth chapter. The process of obtaining a 1 in a location, and then making all other entries zeros in that column, is called pivoting. The number that is made a 1 is called the pivot element, and the row that contains the pivot element is called the pivot row. We often multiply the pivot row by a number and add it to another row to obtain a zero in the latter. The row to which a multiple of pivot row is added is called the target row.\n\nSystems of Linear Equations – Special Cases\n\nSection Overview\n\nIn this section you will learn to:\n\nDetermine the linear systems that have no solution.\n\nSolve the linear systems that have infinitely many solutions.\n\nIf we consider the intersection of two lines in a plane, three things can happen.\n\nThe lines intersect in exactly one point. This is called an independent system.\n\nThe lines are parallel, so they do not intersect. This is called an inconsistent system.\n\nThe lines coincide, so they intersect at infinitely many points. This is a dependent system.\n\nThe figures below shows all three cases.\n\nFigure 1\n\nEvery system of equations has either one solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions.\n\nIn the Section 4, we used the Gauss-Jordan method to solve systems that had exactly one solution. In this section, we will determine the systems that have no solution, and solve the systems that have infinitely many solutions.\n\nExample 19\n\nProblem 1\n\nSolve the following system of equations.\n\nx+y=7x+y=7 size 12{x+y=7} {}\n\n(76)\n\nx+y=9x+y=9 size 12{x+y=9} {}\n\n(77)\n\nSolution\n\nLet us use the Gauss-Jordan method to solve this system. The augmented matrix is as follows.\n\nExample 21\n\nProblem 1\n\nSolution\n\nThe problem clearly asks for the intersection of two lines that are the same; that is, the lines coincide. This means the lines intersect at an infinite number of points.\n\nA few intersection points are listed as follows: (3, 4), (5, 2), (–1, 8), (–6, 13) etc. However, when a system has an infinite number of solutions, the solution is often expressed in the parametric form. This can be accomplished by assigning an arbitrary constant,\ntt size 12{t} {}, to one of the variables, and then solving for the remaining variables. Therefore, if we let\ny=ty=t size 12{y=t} {}, then\nx=7−tx=7−t size 12{x=7 - t} {}. Or we can say all ordered pairs of the form (\n7−t7−t size 12{7 - t} {},\ntt size 12{t} {}) satisfy the given system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, while solving the Gauss-Jordan method, we will get the reduced row-echelon form given below.\n\nThe row of all zeros, can simply be discarded in a manner that it never existed. This leaves us with only one equation but two variables. And whenever there are more variables than the equations, the solution must be expressed in terms of an arbitrary constant, as above. That is,\nx=7−tx=7−t size 12{x=7 - t} {},\ny=ty=t size 12{y=t} {}.\n\nSince the last equation dropped out, we are left with two equations and three variables. This means the system has infinite number of solutions. We express those solutions in the parametric form by letting the last variable\nzz size 12{z} {} equal the parameter\ntt size 12{t} {}.\n\nThe reader should note that particular solutions to the system can be obtained by assigning values to the parameter\ntt size 12{t} {}. For example, if we let\nt=2t=2 size 12{t=2} {}, we have the solution (5, –5, 2).\n\nThis time the last two equations drop out, and we are left with one equation and three variables. Again, there are infinite number of solutions. But this time the answer must be expressed in terms of two arbitrary constants.\n\nIf any row of the reduced row-echelon form of the matrix gives a false statement such as 0 = 1, the system is inconsistent and has no solution.\n\nIf the reduced row echelon form has fewer equations than the variables and the system is consistent, then the system has an infinite number of solutions. Remember the rows that contain all zeros are dropped.\n\nIf a system has an infinite number of solutions, the solution must be expressed in the parametric form.\n\nThe number of arbitrary parameters equals the number of variables minus the number of equations.\n\nInverse Matrices\n\nSection Overview\n\nIn this section you will learn to:\n\nFind the inverse of a matrix, if it exists.\n\nUse inverses to solve linear systems.\n\nIn this section, we will learn to find the inverse of a matrix, if it exists. Later, we will use matrix inverses to solve linear systems.\n\nAs we look at the two augmented matrices, we notice that the coefficient matrix for both the matrices is the same. Which implies the row operations of the Gauss-Jordan method will also be the same. A great deal of work can be saved if the two right hand columns are grouped together to form one augmented matrix as below.\n\nNow that we know how to find the inverse of a matrix, we will use inverses to solve systems of equations. The method is analogous to solving a simple equation like the one below.\n\n23x=423x=4 size 12{ { {2} over {3} } x=4} {}\n\n(122)\n\nExample 28\n\nProblem 1\n\nSolve the following equation .\n\n23x=423x=4 size 12{ { {2} over {3} } x=4} {}\n\n(123)\n\nSolution\n\nTo solve the above equation, we multiply both sides of the equation by the multiplicative inverse of\n2323 size 12{ { {2} over {3} } } {} which happens to be\n3232 size 12{ { {3} over {2} } } {} . We get\n\nTo solve a linear system, we first write the system in the matrix equation\nAX=BAX=B size 12{ ital \"AX\"=B} {}, where\nAA size 12{A} {} is the coefficient matrix,\nXX size 12{X} {} the matrix of variables, and\nBB size 12{B} {} the matrix of constant terms. We then multiply both sides of this equation by the multiplicative inverse of the matrix\nAA size 12{A} {}.\n\nConsider the following example.\n\nExample 29\n\nProblem 1\n\nSolve the following system\n\n3x+y=33x+y=3 size 12{3x+y=3} {}\n\n(126)\n\n5x+2y=45x+2y=4 size 12{5x+2y=4} {}\n\n(127)\n\nSolution\n\nTo solve the above equation, first we express the system as\n\nAX=BAX=B size 12{ ital \"AX\"=B} {}\n\n(128)\n\nwhere\nAA size 12{A} {} is the coefficient matrix, and\nBB size 12{B} {} is the matrix of constant terms. We get\n\nOnce again, we remind the reader that not every system of equations can be solved by the matrix inverse method. Although the Gauss-Jordan method works for every situation, the matrix inverse method works only in cases where the inverse of the square matrix exists. In such cases the system has a unique solution.\n\nApplication of Matrices in Cryptography\n\nIn this section, we see a use of matrices in encoding and decoding secret messages. There are many techniques used, but we will use a method that first converts the secret message into a string of numbers by arbitrarily assigning a number to each letter of the message. Next we convert this string of numbers into a new set of numbers by multiplying the string by a square matrix of our choice that has an inverse. This new set of numbers represents the coded message. To decode the message, we take the string of coded numbers and multiply it by the inverse of the matrix to get the original string of numbers. Finally, by associating the numbers with their corresponding letters, we obtain the original message.\n\nIn this section, we will use the correspondence where the letters A to Z correspond to the numbers 1 to 26, as shown below, and a space is represented by the number 27, and all punctuation is ignored.\n\nExample 31\n\nProblem 1\n\nSolution\n\nWe divide the letters of the message into groups of two.\n\nAT TA CK –N OW\n\nWe assign the numbers to these letters from the above table, and convert each pair of numbers into\n2×12×1 size 12{2 times 1} {} matrices. In the case where a single letter is left over on the end, a space is added to make it into a pair.\n\nTO ENCODE A MESSAGE\n\nConvert each group into a string of numbers by assigning a number to each letter of the message. Remember to assign letters to blank spaces.\n\nConvert each group of numbers into column matrices.\n\nConvert these column matrices into a new set of column matrices by multiplying them with a compatible square matrix of your choice that has an inverse. This new set of numbers or matrices represents the coded message.\n\nTO DECODE A MESSAGE\n\nTake the string of coded numbers and multiply it by the inverse of the matrix that was used to encode the message.\n\nAssociate the numbers with their corresponding letters.\n\nApplications – Leontief Models\n\nIn the 1930's, Wassily Leontief used matrices to model economic systems. His models, often referred to as the input-output models, divide the economy into sectors where each sector produces goods and services not only for itself but also for other sectors. These sectors are dependent on each other and the total input always equals the total output. In 1973, he won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this field. In this section we look at both the closed and the open models that he developed.\n\nThe Closed Model\n\nAs an example of the closed model, we look at a very simple economy, where there are only three sectors: food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nExample 36\n\nProblem 1\n\nWe assume that in a village there is a farmer, carpenter, and a tailor, who provide the three essential goods: food, shelter, and clothing. Suppose the farmer himself consumes 40% of the food he produces, and gives 40% to the carpenter, and 20% to the tailor. Thirty percent of the carpenter's production is consumed by himself, 40% by the farmer, and 30% by the carpenter. Fifty percent of the tailor's production is used by himself, 30% by the farmer, and 20% by the tailor. Write the matrix that describes this closed model.\n\nThis matrix is called the input-output matrix. It is important that we read the matrix correctly. For example the entry\nA23A23 size 12{A rSub { size 8{\"23\"} } } {}, the entry in row 2 and column 3, represents the following.\n\nA23=20%A23=20% size 12{A rSub { size 8{\"23\"} } =\"20\"%} {} of the tailor's production is used by the carpenter.\n\nA33=50%A33=50% size 12{A rSub { size 8{\"33\"} } =\"50\"%} {}of the tailor's production is used by the tailor.\n\nAs we said earlier, in this model input must equal output. That is, the amount paid by each equals the amount received by each.\n\nLet us say the farmer gets paid\nxx size 12{x} {} dollars. Let us now look at the farmer's expenses. The farmer uses up 40% of his own production, that is, of the\nxx size 12{x} {} dollars he gets paid, he pays himself\n.40x.40x size 12{ \".\" \"40\"x} {} dollars, he pays\n.40y.40y size 12{ \".\" \"40\"y} {} dollars to the carpenter, and\n.30z.30z size 12{ \".\" \"30\"z} {} to the tailor. Since the expenses equal the wages, we get the following equation.\n\nNote:\n\nThe use of a calculator in solving these problems is strongly recommended. Although we at De Anza College use TI-85 calculators, any calculator that handles matrices will do.\n\nThe Open Model\n\nThe open model is more realistic, as it deals with the economy where sectors of the economy not only satisfy each others needs, but they also satisfy some outside demands. In this case, the outside demands are put on by the consumer. But the basic assumption is still the same; that is, whatever is produced is consumed.\n\nLet us again look at a very simple scenario. Suppose the economy consists of three people, the farmer\nFF size 12{F} {}, the carpenter\nCC size 12{C} {}, and the tailor\nTT size 12{T} {}. A part of the farmer's production is used by all three, and the rest is used by the consumer. In the same manner, a part of the carpenter's and the tailor's production is used by all three, and rest is used by the consumer.\n\nLet us assume that whatever the farmer produces, 20% is used by him, 15% by the carpenter, 10% by the tailor, and the consumer uses the other 40 billion dollars worth of the food. Ten percent of the carpenter's production is used by him, 25% by the farmer, 5% by the tailor, and 50 billion dollars worth by the consumer. Fifteen percent of the clothing is used by the tailor, 10% by the farmer, 5% by the carpenter, and the remaining 60 billion dollars worth by the consumer. We write the internal consumption in the following table, and express the demand as the matrix D.\n\nTable 4\n\nFF size 12{F} {} produces\n\nCC size 12{C} {} produces\n\nTT size 12{T} {} produces\n\nFF size 12{F} {} uses\n\n.20\n\n.25\n\n.10\n\nCC size 12{C} {} uses\n\n.15\n\n.10\n\n.05\n\nTT size 12{T} {} uses\n\n.10\n\n.05\n\n.15\n\nThe consumer demand for each industry in billions of dollars is given below.\n\nIn the closed model, our equation was\nX=AXX=AX size 12{X = ital \"AX\"} {}, that is, the total input equals the total output. This time our equation is similar with the exception of the demand by the consumer.\n\nSo our equation for the open model should be\nX=AX+DX=AX+D size 12{X= ital \"AX\"+D} {}, where\nDD size 12{D} {} represents the demand matrix. We express it as follows:\n\nWe will do one more problem like the one above, except this time we give the amount of internal and external consumption in dollars and ask for the proportion of the amounts consumed by each of the industries. In other words, we ask for the matrix A.\n\nExample 39\n\nProblem 1\n\nSuppose an economy consists of three industries\nFF size 12{F} {},\nCC size 12{C} {}, and\nTT size 12{T} {}. Again, each of the industries produces for internal consumption among themselves, as well as, the external demand by the consumer. The following table gives information about the use of each industry's production in dollars.\n\nTable 5\n\nFF size 12{F} {}\n\nCC size 12{C} {}\n\nTT size 12{T} {}\n\nDemand\n\nTotal\n\nFF size 12{F} {}\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n100\n\n250\n\nCC size 12{C} {}\n\n30\n\n40\n\n40\n\n110\n\n220\n\nTT size 12{T} {}\n\n20\n\n30\n\n30\n\n120\n\n200\n\nThe first row says that of the $250 dollars worth of production by the industry\nFF size 12{F} {}, $40 is used by\nFF size 12{F} {}, $50 is used by\nCC size 12{C} {}, $60 is used by\nTT size 12{T} {}, and the remainder of $100 is used by the consumer. The other rows are described in a similar manner.\n\nFind the proportion of the amounts consumed by each of the industries. In other words, find the matrix A.\n\nOnce again, the total input equals the total output.\n\nSolution\n\nWe are being asked to determine the following:\n\nHow much of the production of each of the three industries,\nFF size 12{F} {},\nCC size 12{C} {}, and\nTT size 12{T} {} is required to produce one unit of\nFF size 12{F} {}? In the same way, how much of the production of each of the three industries,\nFF size 12{F} {},\nCC size 12{C} {}, and\nTT size 12{T} {} is required to produce one unit of\nCC size 12{C} {}? And finally, how much of the production of each of the three industries,\nFF size 12{F} {},\nCC size 12{C} {}, and\nTT size 12{T} {} is required to produce one unit of\nTT size 12{T} {}?\n\nSince we are looking for proportions, we need to divide the production of each industry by the total production for each industry","id":"/736","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9855867028236389,"__label__0":0.014433346688747406}}

{"text":"Mathematics\n\nThe mathematics curriculum has two primary objectives. The first is to provide students with a thorough grounding in the structure and techniques of the subject area, so that they will be well prepared for future work at the secondary or college level as well as motivated to challenge themselves in these venues. The second is to provide students with an understanding of the utility and power of the subject area and of their current competence and abilities as well as their potential for future development and comprehension.\n\nTowards these objectives, the Mathematics Department faculty promote critical thinking and problem solving skills that will enable students to find success in applying their knowledge of mathematics to other fields. In addition, the faculty develop the skills necessary for students to effectively utilize technology as a mathematical tool for exploration and analysis. Finally, the faculty nurture an appreciation for mathematics as an exact science and of the role it plays in the fields of physical science, art, philosophy, engineering, architecture, and industry.\n\nMathematics Curriculum Overview\n\nIn order to graduate from Avon Old Farms School, students must complete at least three mathematics courses: Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2 with Trigonometry. Upon completion of Algebra 2 with Trigonometry, students are encouraged to enroll in Advanced Mathematics, Precalculus, or Probability and Statistics. After successfully completing Precalculus, students may elect to take Honors Calculus, Advanced Placement Calculus AB, Advanced Placement Calculus BC, or Advanced Placement Probability and Statistics.\n\nAlgebra 1\n\nAlgebra 1 introduces the student to fundamental operations using signed numbers and their elementary applications. The goal of Algebra 1 is to develop fluency in working with expressions, equations and variables. Students will extend their experiences with tables, graphs, and learn to solve linear equations, inequalities and systems of linear equations. Students will generate equivalent expressions and begin to apply formulas to methodically solve questions involving motion, speed and distance. Students will simplify polynomials and begin to study and apply strategies to solve quadratic relationships.\n\nStudents will use technology to learn, investigate, and develop strategies for analyzing complex situations and mathematical relationships. Topics covered in the course include grouping techniques, exponents, algebraic fractions, linear and quadratic equations, radicals, graphing, inequalities, and the solution of verbal problems.\n\nAlgebra 1 Honors\n\nThis course is designed for students who have demonstrated a strong ability in previous mathematics courses and who wish to pursue upper-level mathematics courses throughout their academic career. In addition to the topics covered in the regular Algebra 1 course, the honors section studies mathematical modeling, trigonometry, and calculator programming.\n\nAlgebra 2 with Trigonometry\n\nThis course is a more intensive and extensive study of topics introduced in Algebra 1. The primary objective of the Algebra 2 curriculum is to prepare students for Precalculus or Precalculus Honors. The course is designed to prepare students for college level mathematics and is beneficial for those who will pursue further study in mathematics or related fields. Extensive work is included with equalities, inequalities, absolute value, fractional and negative exponents, radicals, systems of quadratics, logarithms and trigonometric properties. The content of the course is organized around families of functions, including linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, radical and rational functions. Students will learn to represent functions in multiple ways, including verbal descriptions, equations, tables, and graphs. Students will also learn to model real-world situations using functions. To help students prepare for standardized tests, this course provides instruction and practice in a variety of formats. Graphing calculator skills will be taught and used extensively in this course. Throughout this course, students will develop learning strategies, critical thinking skills, and problem solving techniques to prepare for future math courses and college entrance exams.\n\nAlgebra 2 with Trigonometry Honors\n\nThis course is an extensive, fast-moving study of the fundamental principles of algebra, trigonometry, probability, and statistics to prepare students for Precalculus. Students who earn a high \"B\" range grade or better in this class usually pursue Honors Precalculus the following year. Topics covered include linear equations, functions, polynomials, complex numbers, quadratic equations, and functions. The honors class will also complete chapters on analytic geometry, exponential functions, trigonometry, sequences, series, and probability. Students completing this class in good standing are prepared to study pre-calculus.\n\nAlgebra is the language of calculus. Understanding this, there will be special emphasis early in the year on developing a solid working understanding of the algebraic skills and procedures necessary for success in higher level math courses. Students will learn to define the major concepts in a second year algebra course including polynomials, rational expressions, radical expressions, and complex numbers and then learn how to simplify, add, subtract, multiply and divide these expressions. Other major themes include: solving various types of equations and inequalities, factoring, understanding the concept of a function, and graphing functions on the coordinate plane. Linear and quadratic functions are studied in great detail. Later in the year, students will be introduced to higher degree polynomial functions and associated theorems. Students are introduced to conic sections, exponents and logarithms, right triangle and circular trigonometry, and, if time permits, sequences and series.\n\nGeometry\n\nGeometry's primary objective is the study of Euclidean Geometry as a formal, logical system. Where possible, excursions are made into three-dimensional figures and elementary analytic geometry. Some review of algebraic materials may be included. This course begins with developing visualization and some drawing skills. Both algebraic and geometric models are introduced and are further enhanced throughout the course. Proofs are developed slowly in the first half of the course. Various proof formats, including paragraph, flow-chart, and two-column proofs are presented. Students are expected to be actively involved in their own learning. The use of manipulatives is integrated into this course.\n\nGeometry Honors\n\nThe Geometry Honors course begins with a strong development of visualization and drawing skills. Both algebraic and geometric models are introduced and are used throughout the course. Proofs are developed slowly in the first half of the year. Various proof formats, including paragraph, flow chart, and two column proofs, are presented. Students are expected to be actively involved in their own learning. Manipulatives, constructions, and the computer program Geometer's Sketchpad are also integrated into this course.\n\nAdvanced Mathematics\n\nThis course consists of a more thorough treatment of Trigonometry and other selected topics in Algebra 2 with Trigonometry to prepare students for further study in mathematics. Algebra 2 with Trigonometry is a prerequisite. The primary objective of the Advanced Math curriculum is to prepare students for Precalculus. Integral to the learning process is the systematic review of earlier concepts learned in Algebra 2 with Trigonometry and procedures in which students use previously learned skills to develop proficiency with more advanced concepts. The Advanced Math course includes organizational skills, communication, mathematical tools, calculators, hands on activities and group work.\n\nPrecalculus\n\nThe primary objective of the Precalculus curriculum is to prepare students for Calculus. Integral to the learning process is the systematic review of earlier concepts learned in Algebra 2 and/or Advanced Math and procedures in which students use previously learned skills to develop proficiency with more advanced concepts, especially Trigonometry. The Precalculus course includes exploration, communication, mathematical tools, manipulatives, calculators, hands on activities and group work.\n\nPrecalculus Honors\n\nDesigned to prepare the more advanced student for Advanced Placement Calculus, this course provides students an honors level study of trigonometry, advanced functions, analytic geometry, and data analysis. A faster pace also allows for the introduction of topics from calculus earlier in the second semester. Limits, continuity, the definition of the derivative, techniques of differentiation, and applications of the derivative are all explored. Applications and modeling are included throughout the course. Appropriate technology is used regularly for instruction and assessment.\n\nCalculus\n\nThis advanced course is an introduction to the fundamental topics comprising calculus. Algebraic, trigonometric, and transcendental functions are studied in the context of differentiation and integration. The Calculus curriculum includes exploration, communication, mathematical tools, manipulatives, calculators, hands on activities and group work. At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to use calculus methods in a variety of applications and problem solving situations.\n\nCalculus Honors\n\nThis advanced course is an introduction to the fundamental topics of calculus. Algebraic, trigonometric, and transcendental functions are studied in the context of differentiation and integration. The Honors Calculus curriculum is designed to introduce students to the many application of calculus, learn the fundamental rules of calculus, and develop strong problem solving skills. Students will learn how to use technologies such as the graphing calculator, Mathematica, and Excel to investigate various calculus topics and real world problems. Upon completion of this course, students should be well prepared to move onto a first year college level calculus course.\n\nProbability and Statistics\n\nLess rigorous than Pre-Calculus, the primary objective of Probability and Statistics is to offer students an opportunity to continue their mathematical studies in a new area. This course begins with an overview of statistics and includes an investigation of the fundamental laws of probability. It also includes such topics as distributions, sampling, regression, estimation, and hypothesis testing.\n\nAdvanced Placement Calculus AB\n\nThis is a rigorous Advanced Placement course designed to prepare students for the AP Calculus AB exam in the spring. The course seeks to develop students' understanding of the concepts of calculus, while providing experience with its methods and applications. A multi-representational approach to calculus is employed with concepts, results, and problems being expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. The connections between these representations are also explored.\n\nAdvanced Placement Calculus BC\n\nThis is a rigorous Advanced Placement course that prepares students to take the AP Calculus BC exam in the spring. The course seeks to develop advanced problem solving skills by stressing the application of the concepts covered in the problem solving process. The class requires some vacation assignments that are to reinforce the concepts that have been taught. The class moves quickly and covers all the material outlined by the College Board and is intended for students that have had success in Precalculus or lower levels of Calculus and want to challenge themselves at the highest level.\n\nAdvanced Placement Statistics\n\nAP Statistics is the high school equivalent of a one semester, introductory college statistics course. In this rigorous course, students develop strategies for collecting, organizing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students design, administer, and tabulate results from surveys and experiments. Probability and simulations aid students in constructing models for chance behavior. Sampling distributions provide the logical structure for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Students use a TI-84 graphing calculator, Fathom and Minitab statistical software, and Web-based java applets to investigate statistical concepts. To develop effective statistical communication skills, students are required to prepare frequent written and oral analyses of real data.","id":"/747","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9536636471748352,"__label__0":0.04635639116168022}}
{"text":"Academics\nJean-Martin Albert - Mathematics Fellow\n\nJean-Martin Albert is an enthusiastic teacher with experience teaching math courses and tutoring students, and is well prepared to teach mathematical concepts to students coming from a wide variety of backgrounds. He comes to Marlboro after working in several Canadian provinces, and is looking forward to collaborating with logicians in New England and New York.\n\nTeaching Philosophy\n\nFrom his experience as a math teacher and teaching assistant for all levels of undergraduate courses, Jean-Martin has learned that many students, especially in introductory courses, are intimidated by mathematics, and view the material as abstract and tedious. He says, \"I try to show them that mathematics can be fun and useful, and most often, especially at the introductory level, not very far removed from reality. My enthusiasm plays a big part in the process.\"\n\nJean-Martin believes that \"the best way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics, and a big part of doing mathematics is solving problems. I try to show the students that each formula and each theorem is the answer to a particular question, whether the question came from the real world or is mathematics for its own sake.\" He also notes that discussion and teamwork are an important part of learning mathematics. \"Each student will see a problem in a slightly different light, and so each will consider a different approach to the solution.\" He then asks students to try to explain to him or to other students how they arrive at a solution, in order to help them internalize and remember the solution they found. He also encourages mistakes: \"I want the students to fall into traps, make mistakes, and learn to see exactly where they made the mistake, and how to recover from it.\"\n\nScholarly Activities\n\nJean-Martin is interested in mathematical logic, more specifically continuous model theory and its applications to functional analysis. This is a new and exciting area of mathematical logic, which has applications to many other mathematical areas such as algebra, topology, functional analysis, p-adic analysis and probability.\n\nSelected Conference Presentations\n\n\"Strong Conceptual Completeness for First-Order Continuous Logic.\" North American Annual Meeting of the Association for Symbolic Logic, March 2010.","id":"/750","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9238508939743042,"__label__0":0.07616908848285675}}

{"text":"Description: This course studies fundamental algebraic systems in mathematics, selected from groups, rings, fields, and modules. Examples of groups include the invertible matrices with a fixed size and the roots of unity. Rings are illustrated by integers, polynomials, and modular arithmetic. Complex numbers, rational numbers, and rational functions are examples of fields. (There are also finite fields, which are used all the time in computer science.) Finally, ordinary vectors in space and any lattice in the plane are examples of modules. The concern with these algebraic systems is not simply the study of individual systems, but also of functions between systems which carry one operation into the other. For instance, the determinant not only converts matrices into numbers, but it sends a product of matrices into a product of numbers. The level of attention given to such operation-preserving transformations (putting them on an equal footing with the algebraic systems they transform) is one of the characteristic features of abstract algebra, and also one of the algebraic ideas which have reached into other areas of mathematics. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in MATH 2142(244) or 2710(213). Recommended preparation: MATH 2210Q(227Q) or 2144Q(246Q).

{"text":"Core Abilities (Note: since this course may be taken in partial fulfillment of the general education requirements, this syllabus includes the following set of core ability goals.)\n\n1. Thinking: Students engage in the process of inquiry and problem solving that involves both critical and creative thinking.\n\nStudents will be exposed to the logic of mathematical proof\n\nStudents will develop their problem-solving skills\n\nCalculus is a major intellectual development in human history and students will think through the concepts\n\n2. Communication: Students communicate orally and in writing in an appropriate manner both personally and professionally.\n\nStudents will develop their skills of written mathematical communication, specifically learning to properly use the language and notation of the Calculus\n\nStudents will develop their verbal mathematical communication skills, both in small groups and in class discussions\n\n3. Life Values: Students analyze, evaluate and respond to ethical issues from informed personal, professional, and social value systems.\n\nStudents will see the importance of integrity regarding their own scholarship\n\n4. Community Involvement: Students demonstrate skills of interdependent group participation and decision-making.\n\nStudents will work in groups, learning to share their ideas and skills, and respecting the ideas and skills of others\n\nSpecific Course Goals:\n\n1. From the perspective of mathematical content, this course should allow the student to expand and apply skills and knowledge gained in the first semester of Calculus to the topics of integration and applications of integration.\n\n2. The student will gain knowledge and skills, and the ability to apply these, to a variety of situations which might be encountered in the world of mathematics, science, or engineering.\n\n3. The student will further improve his/her ability to communicate mathematical ideas and solutions to problems.\n\n4. The student will improve her/his problem-solving ability.\n\n5. From a most general perspective, the student should see growth in his/her mathematical maturity. The three-semester sequence of calculus courses form the foundation of any serious study of mathematics or other mathematically-oriented disciplines.\n\nCourse Philosophy and Procedures:\n\nI am a firm believer in the notion that you as the student must be actively engaged in the learning process and that this is best accomplished by your DOING mathematics. My job here is not to somehow convince you that I know how to do the mathematics included in the course, but to help guide YOU through the material; I am to be a \"guide on the side, NOT a sage on the stage\". I may not always say things in the way which best leads to your full comprehension, but I will try to do so and I ask that you try to see your learning as something YOU DO rather than as something I do to you. PLEASE feel free to come see me to discuss questions or concerns you may have during the course; I will not bite! PLEASE ask questions in class if you have them; the only dumb question is the one you fail to ask!\n\nHomework: Let me therefore urge you to make it a regular part of your day to try working the homework problems. There will never be enough time for us to go through every listed problem in class, and it is probably unrealistic to think that you will be able to find the time to work through every listed problem, but you should at least spend some time thinking about virtually every problem, and working the more interesting or challenging to completion. The daily homework assignments will not generally be collected or graded. They are intended to structure your learning so that you regularly challenge yourself to see that you understand the material we are looking at. The important thing is that you at least look at all the assigned problems. You should also feel free to work other problems if you deem it necessary for your comprehension of the content.\n\nYou should view homework assignments as a test to see how well you understand the material and you should bring to the next class any questions you might have.\n\nGroup Work: In general, I think students can benefit greatly by working together on problems. While there is some danger of the \"blind leading the blind\" syndrome, or of students deceiving themselves into thinking they understand the material better than they actually do, for the most part grappling with ideas and trying to explain them to another student or learning to listen to others explain an idea is a wonderful way to see that you really do understand the material. In class we will spend an occasional day working on a group \"lab\", and we sill also typically have a group \"practice exam\" before the individual exams, and I also encourage you to find a \"learning group\" outside of class.\n\nPortfolio: I will be asking you to keep a PORTFOLIO of your work. This portfolio will be collected twice during the semester, once upon our return from our spring break, on Monday 17 March, and again at the end of the course, on Friday 2 May. Each of these portfolios should be a representative collection of your work during that half of the semester; each collection you turn in should include 5 problems, written up in a finished form, along with a brief discussion of why you chose to include that particular problem. These problems should represent work you are proud of, or problems which brought you to a breakthrough point. Each of these portfolios of your work will be worth 40 points, 8 points per problem. Presumably you will hand in 5 sheets of paper, each of which will include a nicely organized solution to the problem, which might be from homework, or from a lab or worksheet, of from an exam, along with that reflection mentioned above.\n\nGrading: I use a rather traditional Grading Scale: A = 90% (or better), AB = 87%, B = 80%, BC = 77%, C = 70%, CD = 67%, D = 60%. I do try to come up with a mix of points so that exams are not weighted too heavily; about two-thirds of the points during the semester will come from individual, in-class exams - the rest will come from group labs, take-home problems, group practice exams, journals, and portfolios.\n\nLate Assignments: It is rarely much of a problem at the level of a calculus course, but it remains important that students turn in work in a timely manner, so that they do not get behind. Consequently, Late Assignments will be penalized 20% of the possible points for each class period late, up to a maximum of three periods. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted.\n\nAttendance: I do not prefer to quantify your attendance in terms of a grade, but I can assure you that your chances of success will be much improved by regular attendance.\n\nAmericans with Disability Act:\n\nIf you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services or other accommodations for this class, please see me or Wayne Wojciechowski in MC 320 (796-3085) within 10 days to discuss your accommodation needs.","id":"/756","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.934615433216095,"__label__0":0.06540462374687195}}

First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.\n\nThis video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.\n\nContinuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions. Note: The current set of practice problems titled �Chain rule 1� cannot be solved until one knows how to find the derivative of ex and trigonometric functions\n\nIn the first example, instead of actually using the quotient rule, Sal rewrites the denominator as a negative exponent and uses the product rule. In subsequent examples, Sal shows, but does not prove, the derivative of several interesting functions including ex, ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x.\n\nAfter defining L�Hopital�s rule, Sal shows an example of using the rule to solve for the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x) / x. He also describes what it means for a fraction to have indeterminate form.\n\nAfter applying L�Hopitals Rule once and showing that the limit is still indeterminate, Sal applies the rule a second and third time before arriving at a limit that exists.

{"text":"Category: Math curriculum in general\n\nSome people will be surprised that our Mathematical Literacy course includes some factoring. Over the years, the topic of factoring has been a focal point of conversations — almost with the assumption that a reform math course would not cover any factoring. Sometimes, we go to the extreme view of \"anything not practical right now … will be omitted\", and factoring is usually not very practical.\n\nIn our Mathematical Literacy course we covered factoring last week — true, this is just the GCF (no trinomial methods nor special formulas). Since we only include GCF as a method students have an easier time. However, if we had time, I would not mind if we covered a little more factoring.\n\nFor language skills, it is important that people be able to express thoughts concisely (simplify); in some important situations, it is even more important to be able to express thoughts in a more complex way that maintains the equivalent message — persuasive writing and speaking are particular modes in this style. In a general way, learning (or a process) that can only be used one direction is usually learned only partially. Deeper learning depends upon a variety of experiences with objects or ideas.\n\nFactoring plays a comparable role in any course emphasizing algebraic reasoning. A basic issue in algebraic reasoning is \"Adding or multiplying?\" Many of our students believe that parentheses always show two things — what to do first (under the curse of PEMDAS) and \"this is a product\". Our work with the GCF puts students right in the middle of this confusion; in other words, the GCF is a great opportunity for students to better understand basic algebraic notation.\n\nOf course, one risk of this work with the GCF is that students get even more confused. We need to be careful that assessments help students understand better; within the Math Lit class, I need more experience designing the class work so better assessments can be delivered to students.\n\nOf the traditional developmental algebra content, factoring is not my lowest priority — it connects with basic issues of algebra. I can't say the same thing for radical expressions, where we deal with procedures only vaguely connected with exponents. I also place 'rational expressions' lower in priority than factoring; outside of the very basic ideas of reducing simple rational expressions, our time on operations and equations with rational expressions list mostly wasted … the emphasis ends up on procedures, not concepts and understanding. Such topics have been included in developmental courses because they are seen as needed in pre-calculus courses … because they are seen as needed in calculus courses. We should strengthen this flimsy curriculum design based on student needs AND content needs in deliberate ways.\n\nAll of us have a role in this process so that mathematics becomes an enabling process rather than a inhibiting process. Factoring polynomials is not necessarily an evil to be avoided.\n\nJoin Dev Math Revival on Facebook:\n\nShare this:\n\nThe AMATYC conference (Anaheim, October 31 to November 3) will include several sessions on New Life-inspired efforts to reform developmental mathematics. I will be doing a general session on the New Life model at the conference, and other sessions will focus on particular implementations. Over the next month or so, I will be posting a detailed schedule.\n\nThis conference will not include a workshop on the New Life courses; this workshop was done at last year's conference and the materials are still available at  If you want to know more about the details of MLCS (Mathematical Literacy for College Students) and AL (Algebraic Literacy), I plan to create some additional 5-minute presentations about each — they will be posted on the \"Instant Presentations\" page (\n\nSome related work will also be available at the conference — the Dana Center \"New Mathways Project\" will have sessions. When the mini-program is available, I will post a summary of all reform-related sessions.\n\nShare this:\n\nA course design can facilitate learning, and a course design can hinder learning. I suspect that we get so focused on the details of our math courses that we may not notice whether our course is facilitating or hindering.\n\nIn our Math Literacy class, we have been working on algebraic reasoning. On the surface, the class looks like we are not 'covering' very much because we don't include some typical algebraic (developmental) topics. We found some hidden treasure this week in class.\n\nAs we often do, part of class is based on groups figuring out problems with some guidance and reflection. Today this meant that we had each group do an equation 'tag-team' style — each student could either do the next step, or erase the last step. Students had a little trouble playing by the rules, and wanted to switch to 'their' method to solve the equation. The payoff came when we talked about the different choices, as more students figured out that they have options for linear equations.\n\nThe hidden treasure came next, not that students saw it as totally good. We looked at how we could solve equations of a type never seen before, starting with a simple rational equation (namely, 5 = 200/x). Students could see the solution (40) though not always obtained formally, so we talked about doing 'opposite' operations to solve. We followed this with a radical equation (the pendulum model), which is not normally seen in this level of math course. To solve for the length inside the radical, we listed the calculation steps if we knew the length and wanted to calculate the period. Then, we reversed — the opposite operations in the reverse order.\n\nTo me, the hidden treasure in this is that students get to think about both types of skills that we use in mathematics — we have routine procedures (often based on properties) and we have reasoning about statements (often based on relationships unique to the problem). Wouldn't it be wonderful if students developed both strategies, instead of just using routine procedures (often memorized)?\n\nIt's clear that my hidden treasure was not perfectly clear to students; after this discussion, we had a worksheet which included an equation of related design. They generally understood the reverse order idea, but thought they should do them in a different order — a choice which requires applying properties of expressions. Our conversation was more satisfying than normal because we had used the reasoning approach, and talked about choices.\n\nStudents may still 'want' a recipe for solving equations and simplifying expressions. Giving students a recipe hides the math treasure; emphasizing choices and reasoning allows for the possibility of students finding our hidden treasure.","id":"/778","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9709575176239014,"__label__0":0.029062509536743164}}

{"text":"Note: This course serves as a pre-requisite for MATH 110 (College Algebra), MATH 130 (Introductory Statistics), or MATH 155 (Mathematics, A Way of Thinking). You must earn at least a \"C\" grade to qualify for the next course in your sequence.\n\nALEKS Student Access Code: Purchased from the Viterbo Bookstore.\n\nYou will also need the appropriate Course Code for your specific section, which is provided later in this document.\n\nThis textbook is published by McGraw-Hill, who also handles ALEKS for institutions of higher education. Our text has been precisely integrated with ALEKS, so that you can use your book for explanations, worked examples and practice problems as we move our way through the course material.\n\nCourse Goals and Student Outcomes:\n\n1. Students will demonstrate their readiness for learning algebra.\n\n(a) Students will take ALEKS assessment.\n\n(b) Students will work through pre-algebra ALEKS modules indicated as necessary.\n\n2. Students will improve their mastery of algebraic skills.\n\n(a) Students will take ALEKS assessment of algebra knowledge and skills.\n\n(b) Students will work through the ALEKS modules indicated as necessary.\n\n(c) Students will take indicated exams to demonstrate their learning.\n\n3. Students will develop their ability to apply algebraic thinking and procedures to problem solving.\n\n(a) Students will work through the ALEKS modules that focus on problem solving.\n\nCourse Procedures and Policies:\n\nMATH 001: Math 001, \"Introductory Algebra\", is a not-for-graduation-credit course intended to prepare students for the various courses for which 001 is a pre-requisite, namely MATH 110 (College Algebra), MATH 130 (Introductory Statistics), and MATH 155 (Mathematics, A Way of Thinking). The material is essentially the first year of algebra, which would typically be taken in high school, which explains why this course is numbered 001, and why the 4 credits you will earn here do not count toward graduation, even though they do count toward full-time status.\n\nYour placement score indicated that you have not mastered this content, whatever the reason. To make the best of the situation, your goal here must be to learn this material and master the necessary skills so that you can be successful in the courses you eventually need to take as part of your college program.\n\nALEKS: ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces) is a web-based program designed to carefully assess what students know and what they are ready to learn, and then to methodically tutor them in the given material, in this case Introductory Algebra. After registering, you will begin by going through a brief tutorial on the use of the ALEKS input tool, also called the \"Answer Editor.\" On the second day you will do the Initial Assessment in class.\n\nProbably the best thing about ALEKS is that it allows each student to take a course specifically designed for his/her individual needs – students will be working at their own pace and working on material they are ready to learn. The implication of this is that I will not be \"lecturing\" on textbook sections in the customary way. My role as instructor here is to monitor your learning and to engage in individual tutoring as the need arises.\n\nAnother advantage to using ALEKS is that since it is web-based you can work on your course anywhere you have internet access. ALEKS will remember where you left off and will always make sure that you have shown readiness before presenting new material. However, the Initial Assessment and all Quizzes/Exams must be taken during class.\n\nBe sure to do your own work! Your best preparation for online in-class quizzes is when you have been working with ALEKS yourself. By allowing someone else to do your work for you, the only person you are cheating is yourself.\n\nGrading System: Your grade will be determined by the following five factors:\n\n(5) Attendance/ALEKS time outside of class: Important determination for borderline grades\n\nThis makes for a total of 560 points. Grades will be assigned according to the scale:\n\nA 93% or above\n\nAB 88 – 92%\n\nB 82 – 87%\n\nBC 77 – 81%\n\nC 70 – 76%\n\nCD 65 – 69%\n\nD 60 – 64%\n\nF < 60%\n\n**NOTE** You also need to complete at least or 80% of the ALEKS topics to pass the course. You need at least a \"C\" grade to be allowed to advance to the next course in your sequence.\n\n(1) Check-Offs: You will all receive a packet containing Check-Offs which are basically practice problems for questions covered throughout the course. Think of these as homework problems that need to be turned-in. As you master the topics covered on each Check-Off, complete the questions and submit your packet for review. Each section (A – L) is worth 5 points. The Check-Offs need to be completed during class in order to receive credit.\n\n(2) ALEKS Quizzes: In addition to automatic assessments produced by ALEKS based on your completion, ALEKS has the ability to construct exams at points indicated by the instructor. I tell ALEKS what material I want covered and the program constructs problems that test understanding of that material. You will need to complete a Quiz for each chapter of ALEKS, which should correspond to a chapter in your text. Each quiz will be worth 20 points. You can take the quizzes when you complete a chapter, however, there will be a due date at which point you must have the quiz completed whether or not you have finished the material on ALEKS. You can use your handwritten notes on the quizzes. DO NOT use the text.\n\nThink of quizzes as a way to keep yourself on schedule for completing the course by the end of the semester.\n\n* For each Quiz, although it will be taken online, you need to turn-in a paper/pencil copy of the questions with your work and answers at the end of the class period during which each Quiz is taken. At the completion of the Quiz, you will receive your score. If you do not pass a Quiz or plan to retake it, do not turn in your work. Study from it - - you are allowed one chance to re-take each quiz.\n\n**REMINDER**These quizzes, even the re-takes, must be taken in the classroom!\n\nA calculator is allowed for all in-class assessments EXCEPT for Quiz #1 .\n\n_______________ __Quiz Schedule: _____________________\n\nDue Date\n\nReview & Chapter 1 January 24, 2007\n\nChapter 2 February 7\n\nChapter 3 February 14\n\nChapter 4 February 21\n\nChapter 5 March 14\nChapter 6 March 21\n\nChapter 7 March 28\n\nChapter 8 April 11\n\nChapter 9 April 18\n\nChapter 10 May 1\n\n(3) ALEKS Modules Completed: On the last two days of class you will take a final assessment, triggered by me. The percentage you score on that assessment is the number of points you receive, based out of 100. This assessment must be completed in the classroom. If you do not finish in one class period, you MUST NOT log on to ALEKS again until you return the next day for class, at which time you can complete your assessment. You must leave record with me as to which problem you were on when you leave, and if you are not on that same problem when you return, you must take the assessment again in the Learning Center. You can use your handwritten notes. DO NOT use the text.\n\n(4) Midterm and Final: The Mid-Term and Final will be a traditional hard-copy test. It will not be an online assessment. Some of you may not be on schedule for the assessments, and this will no doubt affect your performance and, in turn, your Mid-Term and final course grade. The lesson learned here is that part of success in a course is learning the material within a designated amount of time. You will be allowed one instructor-provided note card for notes to use with each test.\n\n(5) Attendance: A major factor in learning mathematics is a regular and focused schedule of practice. You need to practice virtually every day, and for a considerable amount of time each day in order to establish a solid foundation in algebra. To help you work on ALEKS, classroom attendance is REQUIRED every day. I will be keeping track, and will contact you if you miss too many classes. Your attendance will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nALEKS Time: ALEKS keeps track of how much time you have put in as well as how much progress you have made. It is almost impossible to pass the class if you do not spend additional time outside of class on ALEKS. It is suggested that you spend an additional 2 to3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. This commitment will help ensure successful progress through ALEKS. I will be keeping track of your hours spent on ALEKS, and I will contact you if it appears you are not putting in enough time outside of class. Your total number of hours on ALEKS will become a factor if your grade falls on a border between two grading categories.\n\nSchedule: Your starting point and rate of progress are based on your initial assessment and learning rate. Because ALEKS allows students to work at their individual pace, students will be at a variety of places in the material throughout the semester. Still, in order to pass the course and move into the subsequent course you will need to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the material within the semester's time constraints.\n\nIt is possible that some of you will actually complete the ALEKS course before the calendar indicates the semester is over, and that's fine. I will still have you take the final exam with the rest of the class on the scheduled date. And it is possible that some of you may reach December without completing the material. ALEKS offers a guarantee that if you do not pass the course despite having put in at least 80 hours, your license to use ALEKS can be renewed for a semester at no cost. In this case, you will be given a grade of \"I\" (Incomplete), allowing you to work towards completion of the course during the next semester. Of course, this is far from ideal since it means you could not yet enroll in the course you need to take for your major. Use the Quiz dates as a goal for completion!\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act: If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services, or other accommodations for this class, please see me and/or Wayne Wojciechowski, the campus ADA coordinator (MC 335, 796-3085), within ten days to discuss your needs.\n\nAcademic Honesty: Per University policy (handbook page 131), you are expected to do your own work for this class. This includes and is not limited to the completion of all ALEKS work, including practice within ALEKS, and assessments. One example of dishonest behavior would be allowing another student to work problems for you in ALEKS. A second example would be having another student take all or part of an online assessment for you. If it is suspected that you violated this policy, you will need to retake the assessment under supervision.\n\nImportant Dates:\n\nTuesday, May 1: Check-Offs Due\n\nWednesday, May 2 & Thursday, May 3: Completion Assessment on ALEKS\n\nFriday, May 11: Course Final\n\nNo Class Meetings:\n\nMonday, March 5 – Thursday, March 8: Spring Break\n\nMonday, April 9: Easter Break\n\nThe policies and outline of this course are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor.\n\nRevised 1/9/07\n\nUsing ALEKS\n\nYou will need the ALEKS Student Access Code on the back of your ALEKS Users' Guide, purchased from the Bookstore. You will also need the Course Code for your section, which is listed below.\n\n1st Type  the URL line of your browser. Then add the site to Your Favorites.\n\nALEKS will lead you through the process of creating an account. Above the Registered Users box you should click:\n\nNew User? Sign Up Now!\n\n2nd To enroll in your specific section, you will need the appropriate course code:\n\nWVT63-HTFFX Section 001 MRC 316\n\nOn the first day of class, each of you will log in and we will examine the basics of using ALEKS. I will ask you to work your way through the \"Answer Editor\" tutorial so that you become familiar with how to enter mathematical expressions for assessments, on-line work and quizzes. Then on the second day of class I will have you take the initial ALEKS assessment to get a baseline rating of your skills and readiness for the material in this course. It is important that you always put forth your best effort when taking assessments, because this is how ALEKS determines whether or not you have mastered the material already learned.\n\nALEKS keeps track of (and lets your instructor see) how much you have mastered and what you are ready to learn. Below are the topics covered in this course.","id":"/784","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9382012486457825,"__label__0":0.06181876361370087}}

First, discover the secrets to increasing your brain's ability to meet everyday challenges with Optimizing Brain Fitness. Then, gain all the essential skills, tips, and tricks you need to solve a range of mathematical problems right inside your head with The Secrets of Mental Math.\n\nCourse\n1\nof\n2:\nSecrets of Mental Math Professor\nProfessor Arthur T. Benjamin,\nHarvey Mudd College Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University\nImprove and expand your math potential—whether you're a corporate executive or a high-school student—in the company of Professor Arthur T. Benjamin, one of the most entertaining members of The Great Courses faculty. The Secrets of Mental Math, his exciting 12-lecture course, guides you through all the essential skills, tips, and tricks for enhancing your ability to solve a range of mathematical problems right in your head. Along the way, you'll discover how mental mathematics is the gateway to success in understanding and mastering higher fields, including algebra and statistics.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n12\nLectures\n30\nminutes/lecture\n\n1.\nMath in Your Head!\nDive right into the joys of mental math. First, learn the fundamental strategies of mental arithmetic (including the value of adding from left to right, unlike what you do on paper). Then, discover how a variety of shortcuts hold the keys to rapidly solving basic multiplication problems and finding squares.\n\n7.\nIntermediate Multiplication\nTake mental multiplication to an even higher level. Professor Benjamin shows you five methods for accurately multiplying any two-digit numbers. Among these: the squaring method (when both numbers are equal), the \"close together\" method (when both numbers are near each other), and the subtraction method (when one number ends in 6, 7, 8, or 9).\n\n2.\nMental Addition and Subtraction\nProfessor Benjamin demonstrates how easily you can mentally add and subtract one-, two-, and three-digit numbers. He also shows you shortcuts using the complement of a number (its distance from 100 or 1000) and demonstrates the uses of mental addition and subtraction for quickly counting calories and making change.\n\n8.\nThe Speed of Vedic Division\nVedic mathematics, which has been around for centuries, is extremely helpful for solving division problems—much more efficiently than the methods you learned in school. Learn how Vedic division works for dividing numbers of any length by any two-digit numbers.\n\n3.\nGo Forth and Multiply\nDelve into the secrets of easy mental multiplication—Professor Benjamin's favorite mathematical operation. Once you've mastered how to quickly multiply any two-digit or three-digit number by a one-digit number, you've mastered the most fundamental operations of mental multiplication and added a vital tool to your mental math tool kit.\n\n9.\nMemorizing Numbers\nThink that memorizing long numbers sounds impossible? Think again. Investigate a fun—and effective—way to memorize numbers using a phonetic code in which every digit is given a consonant sound. Then practice your knowledge by trying to memorize the first 24 digits of pi, all of your credit card numbers, and more.\n\n4.\nDivide and Conquer\nTurn now to the last fundamental operation of arithmetic: division. Explore a variety of shortcuts for dividing by one- and two-digit numbers; learn how to convert fractions such as 1/7 and 3/16 into decimals; and discover methods for determining when a large number is divisible by numbers such as 3, 7, and 11.\n\n10.\nCalendar Calculating\nThe fun continues in this lecture with determining the day of the week of any date in the past or in the future. What day of the week was July 4, 2000? How about February 12, 1809? You'd be surprised at how easy it is for you to grasp the simple mathematics behind this handy skill.\n\n5.\nThe Art of Guesstimation\nIn most real-world situations—such as figuring out sales tax or how much to tip—you don't need an exact answer but just a reasonable approximation. Here, develop skills for effectively estimating addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.\n\n11.\nAdvanced Multiplication\nProfessor Benjamin shows you how to do enormous multiplication problems in your head, such as squaring three-digit and four-digit numbers; cubing two-digit numbers, and multiplying two-digit and three-digit numbers. While you may not frequently encounter these large problems, knowing how to mentally solve them cements your knowledge of basic mental math skills.\n\n6.\nMental Math and Paper\nSometimes we encounter math problems on paper in our daily lives. Even so, there are some rarely taught techniques to help speed up your calculations and check your answers when you are adding tall columns of numbers, multiplying numbers of any length, and more.\n\n12.\nMasters of Mental Math\nProfessor Benjamin concludes his exciting course by showing how you can use different methods to solve the same problem; how you can find the cube root of large perfect cubes; how you can use the techniques you've learned and mastered in the last 11 lectures; and more.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n12\nLectures\n30\nminutes/lecture\n\n1.\nHow Your Brain Works\nIn order to best optimize your brain fitness, it's important to understand how the brain's circuitry works. After a brief introduction to the course, Professor Restak guides you through a range of intriguing topics, including the principles of brain operation, the organization of the brain, patterns of brain growth, and more.\n\n7.\nExercising Your Working Memory\nFocus now on working memory—the most important memory process of all and one that involves manipulating stored information. After an overview of the topic, dive into a series of engaging exercises that use your creativity, your powers of observation, and your heightened awareness to enhance and improve your working memory.\n\n2.\nHow Your Brain Changes\nYour brain and your intelligence can change throughout your life span. Here, look closer at the way changes in your brain can improve the way you function in your day-to-day life. Also, explore how a series of visual, sensory, and spatial exercises demonstrate the powerful effects of brain plasticity.\n\n8.\nPutting Your Senses to Work\nImaginative memory techniques—such as mnemonic devices and personal associations—have been used to improve memory for over 1,000 years. Try your hand at some of them right here, including \"chunking\" numbers to aid in number recall, creating a vivid story to memorize words, drawing free-form designs, and playing mental chess.\n\n3.\nCare and Feeding of the Brain\nYou can optimize your brain function by paying attention to three key habits: what you eat, how well you sleep, and how much you exercise. Ponder the science behind this three-pronged approach to caring for your brain, and come away with helpful tips you can apply to your own lifestyle.\n\n9.\nEnlisting Your Emotional Memory\nTurn now to an aspect of memory we don't usually consider when thinking about the subject: emotional memory. How did scientists uncover this specific aspect of memory? How does it actually work? And what kinds of playful exercises can you perform to help you relive the emotional experience of your past?\n\n4.\nCreativity and the Playful Brain\nWhat's the connection between daydreaming and creativity? What are four steps for increasing your creativity? Which puzzles are the best for optimizing your brain function—and how can you more efficiently solve them? Learn the answers to these and other questions in this fascinating lecture on creativity and the brain.\n\n10.\nPracticing for Peak Performance\nExceptional performers aren't born with \"superior brains.\" Rather, anyone—thanks to brain plasticity—can achieve high performance levels in an area of interest through deliberate practice. Focus here on two aspects of deliberate practice: remaining fully aware of what you're doing, and concentrating on the most difficult aspects of your performance.\n\n11.\nTaking Advantage of Technology\nTake a closer look at the impact of modern technology on how our brains function.

{"text":"In grades 9-12, the\nmathematics curriculum should include the informal exploration of\ncalculus concepts from both a graphical and a numerical perspective\nso that all students can--\n\ndetermine maximum\nand minimum points of a graph and interpret the results in problem\nsituations;\n\ninvestigate limiting\nprocesses by examining infinite sequences and series and areas\nunder curves;\n\nand so that, in addition,\ncollege-intending students can--\n\nunderstand the\nconceptual foundations of limit, the area under a curve, the rate\nof change, and the slope of a tangent line, and their applications\nin other disciplines;\n\nanalyze the graphs\nof polynomial, rational, radical, and transcendental functions.\n\nFocus\n\nThis standard does not\nadvocate the formal study of calculus in high school for\nall students or even for college-intending students. Rather, it\ncalls for opportunities for students to systematically, but informally,\ninvestigate the central ideas of calculus--limit, the area under\na curve, the rate of change, and the slope of a tangent line--that\ncontribute to a deepening of their understanding of function and\nits utility in representing and answering questions about real-world\nphenomena.\n\nMost of the mathematics\ndescribed in the other 9-12 standards involve finite processes,\nsuch as determining a sequence of transformations that maps a figure\nonto a congruent figure or approximating a zero of a polynominal\nfunction using an iterative technique. In contrast, the concept\nof limit and its connection with the other mathematical topics in\nthis standard is based on infinite processes. Thus, explorations\nof the topics proposed here not only extend students' knowledge\nof function characteristics but also introduce them to another mode\nof mathematical thinking.\n\nInstruction should be highly\nexploratory and based on numerical and geometric experiences that\ncapitalize on both calculator and computer technology. Instructional\nactivities should be aimed at providing students with firm conceptual\nunderpinnings of calculus rather than at developing manipulative\ntechniques.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe development of the\ncalculus represents one of the great intellectual accomplishments\nin human history; perhaps the greatest achievement in the application\nof mathematics is the use of calculus in physics during the first\nthird of this century. Today, methods of calculus are applied increasingly\nin the social and biological sciences, and in business as well.\nAs students explore the topics proposed in this standard, it is\nimportant that they develop an awareness of, and appreciation for,\nthe historical origins and the cultural contributions of the calculus.\n\nThe topics proposed for\ninvestigation in this standard should be developed as natural extensions\nof ideas students have previously encountered. The study of finite\nsequences and series recommended in the discrete-mathematics standard\nleads naturally to consideration of the corresponding infinite cases\nand concepts associated with limiting processes. Considerations\nof infinite sequences and series can occur at many different levels\nof abstraction and formalism. Consider, for example, the series\n\nAt a very concrete level,\nthis series can be summed in parts, as shown in figure\n13.1.\n\nFig. 13.1.An informal approach to infinite series\n\nAt a somewhat higher but\nstill intuitive level, the series can be summed by investigating\nthe limit of the sequence of partial sums (either by using a calculator\nor a simple looping computer program or by applying the formula\nfor the sum of a finite geometric series). An understanding of the\nconcept of limit in contexts such as this should in turn contribute\nto the meaningful development of the remaining topics in this standard.\n\nSimilarly, it is important\nthat all students recognize how the concept of the area under a\ncurve builds on and extends their previous experiences with areas\nof geometric figures. College-intending students also should recognize\nhow the rate of change builds on and extends their experiences with\nuniform motion and associated rates in algebra and trigonometry,\nand how the slope of a tangent to a curve generalizes the notion\nof the slope of a line as developed in algebra.\n\nMany of these concepts\ncan be approached through informal activities that focus on the\nunderstanding of interrelationships. For example, the concepts of\nslope, derivative, velocity, and acceleration could be addressed\nthrough experiences such as the following:\n\nGiven the velocity-time\ngraph shown in figure 13.2, construct reasonable\ndistance-time and acceleration-time graphs for the same system.\n\nNote that correct responses\nmay vary; for example, the distance-time graph could be translated\nvertically.\n\nComputing technology makes\nthe fundamental concepts and applications of calculus accessible\nto all students. The area under a finite portion of a curve, for\nexample, can be approximated geometrically by partitioning the region\ninto rectangles with bases of equal length and heights given by\nfunction values at an endpoint of each base. Using a calculator\nor a computer-based algorithm, students can easily sum the areas\nto obtain a numerical approximation of the desired area. This approximation\ncan then be sharpened by using sequences of rectangles whose bases\nare made to decrease toward zero. Project work might require students\nto investigate other ways of partitioning the region so as to obtain\na more precise estimate. (A description of a process using trapezoids\ncan be found in the standard on mathematical\nconnections.)\n\nAll students could use\na graphing utility to investigate and solve optimization problems,\nincluding the maximum-minimum problems traditionally associated\nwith the first college-level course in calculus, without computing\na derivative. (For an example, see\nExamples of Content Differentiation,) A great deal of mathematical\nunderstanding is reinforced in the context of solving these problems:\ndata analysis, problem formulation, mathematical modeling, geometric\ntopics, translation across multiple representations, and validation.\n\nUsing interactive graphing\nutilities, college-intending students could examine other characteristics\nof the graphs of functions, including continuity, asymptotes, end\nbehavior (i.e., behavior as |x| ), and concavity. Moreover,\nsuch analysis can be applied with equal ease to the graphs of a\nvariety of complicated functions and to curves specified by polar\nand parametric equations.\n\nComputing technology also\npermits the foreshadowing of analytic ideas for college-intending\nstudents. From a computer-graphics perspective, for example, a differentiable\nfunction can be viewed as a function having the property that a\nsmall portion of its graph, when highly magnified, approximates\na line segment. The \"zoom in\" feature permits students\nto magnify the graph of a function over a small interval to view\nthe approximate segment representation and to compute the gradient\n(slope). Using the computer to plot successive gradients for a series\nof short intervals (see fig. 13.4) suggests\na process that derives functions from functions.\n\nFig. 13.4.Using computer graphics to see that the derivative of y\n= sin x is y = cos x\n\nAlthough developing a foundation\nfor the future study of calculus remains a goal of the 9-12 curriculum\nfor college-intending students, equally important is the development\nof prerequisite understandings for further study of statistics,\nprobability, and discrete mathematics. This standard calls for a\nnew balance of skills, concepts, and applications in that portion\nof the curriculum traditionally associated with preparation for\ncalculus. Instead of devoting large blocks of time to developing\na mastery of paper-and-pencil manipulative skills, more time and\neffort should be spent on developing a conceptual understanding\nof key ideas and their applications. All students should have the\nbenefit of a computer-enhanced introduction to some of the types\nof problems for which calculus was developed.","id":"/797","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9831687211990356,"__label__0":0.016851238906383514}}

{"text":"MAA Review\n\n[Reviewed by Fernando Q. Gouvêa, on 05/20/2010]\n\nLie groups play such a central role in mathematics and its applications that all mathematics students should be aware of them. From computer graphics to quantum theory, from differential equations to number theory, Lie groups and algebras are everywhere. Nevertheless, most mathematics undergraduates have never heard of them.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is that even the definition of a Lie group (i.e., a differentiable manifold which is also a group and whose group operations are smooth functions) seems to require more background knowledge than most undergraduates have. In a famous article on \"Very Basic Lie Theory\" (American Mathematical Monthly, 1983), Roger Howe argued that the absence of the theory of Lie groups from most undergraduate programs was both scandalous and unnecessary. Since then, several books attempting to respond to Howe's challenge have appeared. Harriet Pollatsek's Lie Groups is her entry in this list.\n\nHowe's article, and many of the books that it inspired, still laid a heavy emphasis on the underlying topology and analysis, with the result that only advanced undergraduates (in fact, probably only rather strong advanced undergraduates) could really understand the material. Pollatsek is not satisfied with that approach. At Smith College, she has been teaching Lie Groups to sophomores, using a problem-driven approach that only assumes knowledge of linear algebra and multivariable calculus. From that course was born this book.\n\nLie Groups is fundamentally a problem book: each chapter presents a sequence of problems that students should solve. In each chapter, the main sections are followed by a summary section called \"Putting the pieces together.\" Finally, a section called \"A broader view\" tries to give a wider context to the material in that chapter. Everything important is done through problems. Thus, this is a book to be used, not a book to be read.\n\nI must admit that I find teaching this material to sophomore mathematics majors to be a little bit too much of a reach. Instead, I used the book in a seminar course that followed our standard one-semester introduction to abstract algebra. In the class were six seniors, three juniors, and (yes!) a sophomore; all had taken algebra, either in the previous semester or a year before. Most, but not all, had taken other advanced courses as well, including Real Analysis. My students were assigned problems to solve and present in class, and we developed the theory in that way. Every once in a while, I would step in and give a broader view.\n\nDid it work? Yes, it mostly did, though in the process I discovered that some aspects have to be tweaked a little bit. Because Pollatsek doesn't want to assume any algebra background, there are lots of \"check that SL(2,R) is a group\" problems — more than I or my students wanted. Because she doesn't want to assume much knowledge of topology, she does not have the chance to make much of connectedness, compactness, covering spaces, and (most significant in this context) simple connectedness. This seems like an opportunity lost.\n\nSome choices I just don't understand. Why, for example, is there a section on differential equations? It seems totally unrelated to the rest of the book. Why make such a meal of continuity versus differentiability in the definition of one-parameter subgroups? In this setting, one might as well just state that all one-parameter subgroups are differentiable and be done with it. Why not do more with the fact that SU(2) is a three-sphere? (My students were fascinated.) Why work only with the one-dimensional Lorenz group? Why not have more pictures? After all, it's easy to draw pictures of the one-dimensional Lie groups.\n\nIn many of the problems, there is more handholding than I wanted my students to have; at some points, this included \"hints\" that led towards unnecessarily messy ways of doing things. Pollatsek clearly thinks that students at this level prefer computation to theory. She is probably right, but I would rather not indulge that preference.\n\nSome issues had to do with the fact that my students knew some things that her students didn't (what a group is, what a normal subgroup is) but did not have a sure grasp of some things that her students clearly do have well under control (the example that stands out in my mind is the Jacobian matrix of a differentiable map). The bibliography is also a little strange, too selective for my taste. This proved significant towards the end, when my students were working on term papers and all of them wanted the same books… which were not in our library.\n\nThere is no representation theory at all. The adjoint representation is described, but not put into any sort of context. With no representation theory, one cannot do much more than say \"the physicists use this a lot,\" without showing how or why. That seems like a pity.\n\nPollatsek's book faces stiff competition. Perhaps the closest competitor is John Stillwell's Naïve Lie Theory, a beautiful book aimed at upper-level undergraduates that is very much in the same spirit. Kristopher Tapp's Matrix Groups for Undergraduates is also in a similar spirit. The main difference, of course, is that Stillwell and Tapp have written textbooks, while Pollatsek gives us a problem book. Using it requires buy-in: you need to want to teach in this way, and you will need to convince your students that the work is worth doing. If that applies to you, give this book a try.\n\nFernando Q. Gouvêa is Carter Professor of Mathematics at Colby College. He'll be doing the Lie groups thing again soon.","id":"/802","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.964851975440979,"__label__0":0.03516801446676254}}

It also extends the notion of the derivatives covered in the Khan Academy videos, �Calculus Derivatives 2� and �Calculus Derivatives 2.5 (HD).� Note: Additional practice using the power rule for differentiating polynomials (including some with negative exponents) is available to the listener.\n\nThis video is the 4th in a series of videos that explains derivatives. First, Sal shows another example of differentiating a polynomial and then shows two examples using the chain rule. Sal continues the chain rule in the next video.\n\nThis video continues with examples of differentiating functions using the chain rule including examples that use negative exponents and more complicated nested parenthesis. Note: Additional practice on using the chain rule is available.\n\nContinuing to use the chain rule, Sal shows more examples of finding the derivative, this time, by looking at composite functions. Note: The current set of practice problems titled �Chain rule 1� cannot be solved until one knows how to find the derivative of ex and trigonometric functions\n\nIn the first example, instead of actually using the quotient rule, Sal rewrites the denominator as a negative exponent and uses the product rule. In subsequent examples, Sal shows, but does not prove, the derivative of several interesting functions including ex, ln x, sin x, cos x, and tan x.\n\nAfter defining L�Hopital�s rule, Sal shows an example of using the rule to solve for the limit as x approaches 0 of (sin x) / x. He also describes what it means for a fraction to have indeterminate form.\n\nAfter applying L�Hopitals Rule once and showing that the limit is still indeterminate, Sal applies the rule a second and third time before arriving at a limit that exists. He then shows that given that the final limit exits, so do the previous ones including the limit of the first original problem. Note: Practice problems on L�Hopital�s rule are available and can be practiced now or after watching the other example videos.","id":"/807","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9807248115539551,"__label__0":0.019295210018754005}}

{"text":"The Cartoon Guide to Calculus Cartoon Guide to Calculus\n\nCalculus is the mathematics of change...and The Cartoon Guide to Calculus represents a big change from previous books on this subject. Using graphics and humor to lighten what is often perceived as a challenging discipline, Larry Gonick teaches all of the essentials, from functions and limits to derivatives and integrals.\n\nThe cartoon's unnamed narrator, with the help of his friend Delta Wye, guides us through a vast range of concepts. We see, for example, how calculus was initially conceived by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz as a way of resolving age-old mysteries involving the calculation of motion. Newton and Leibniz make several cameo appearances within the book, sometimes to quibble with each other regarding who invented calculus first, but mostly to explain a new concept to us. It's fun to learn about instantaneous velocity with an example involving Newton jumping up and down on a trampoline.\n\nWe go on to study a vast range of functions—Gonick invents a function creature to show how they work. We also are treated to a visual definition of the limit that is significantly easier to understand than the algebraic version that has traditionally been taught to generations of students. Learning derivatives in calculus has always involved diagrams, but not quite as vividly as in this book. For example, at one point, the narrator finds himself in a rapidly filling pool of water in order to calculate the instantaneous rate of flow. Equally refreshing is the way the book shows us a sphere literally being cut up into slices in a section that illustrates how to calculate its volume.\n\nComplete with end-of-chapter exercises, The Cartoon Guide to Calculus will inspire even the most math-phobic among","id":"/810","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9902251958847046,"__label__0":0.009794781915843487}}

{"text":"MAA Review\n\n[Reviewed by Peter Rabinovitch, on 09/22/2011]\n\nA rule I have found to be true is that any book claiming to be suitable for beginners and yet leading to the frontiers of unsolved research problems does neither well. This book is the exception to that rule.\n\nA glance at the table of contents reveals many of the standard combinatorics topics. As the title implies, they are generally explored via bijections. As a user of combinatorics, rather than a dyed in the wool combinatorialist, I find bijections to be the central core of the subject and so I found this book engaging.\n\nThe proofs are very clear, and in many cases several proofs are offered. For example, there may be an algebraic proof of an identity, followed by a bijective proof.\n\nThis book could serve several purposes. By focussing on the first half of the book, it could be an excellent choice for a first course in cominatorics for senior undergraduates. By selecting topics and/or moving quickly, it could work well for a more mature audience. The book is at a higher level than Stanton & White, but lower than Stanley, thus it also makes a great reference for people who use combinatorics but are not specialists.\n\nThere are many exercises. The back cover claims nearly 1000, and although I didn't count them, I have no reason to doubt this claim. Some are very simple, and some are hard — the back cover claims some are unsolved. Many of the exercises are discussed in an appendix, ranging in detail from mere hints to \"draw a diagram\" to full but terse solutions. Because there are so many exercises, and because the level of detail of the provided solutions varies so much, an instructor using this text could easily find appropriate problems for assignment for courses of various levels of sophistication.\n\nThere are few obvious typos.\n\nOn the negative side, the book's web site is empty, and the author uses \"quantum numbers\" and \"quantum binomial coefficients\" etc. rather than the more common \"q numbers\" and \"q binomial coefficients.\"\n\nThis is a very nice book that deserves serious consideration.\n\nPeter Rabinovitch is a Systems Architect at Research in Motion, and a PhD student in probability. He's currently thinking about applications of Mallows permutations.","id":"/816","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9803566932678223,"__label__0":0.019663294777274132}}

{"text":"Suggested Project Topics\n\nHere are a few ideas for project topics for final year, higher diploma, and\nMasters students.

These can be applied to\ncontoling LEGO Mindstrom NXT robot.\n\n2. The Singular Value Decomposition, and it's applications.\n\nThe singular value decomposition (SVD) is an important\nfactorization of a matrix with interesting applications to\na wide variety of areas such as image and signal processing,\ndata compression, computational tomography, etc..\nFor one example of the the SVD can be applied to problems involving in face\nrecognition, see Singular Value Decomposition, Eigenfaces, and 3D Reconstructions by Neil Muller, Lourenco Magaia,\nB.M. Herbst\n\nYou should consider this project if you like Linear Algebra. Some\ncomputing will be essential, but not necessarily\nanything too difficult.\n\n3. Numerical Algorithms for Parallel Computers\n\nMany classical numerical methods were designed for single-processor computers.\nExamples include Gaussian elimination\nor Numerical Integration. With the advent of parallel,\nmultiprocessor and distributed systems, there is a need to revisit\nmany of these methods and to see how they can be adapted for parallel\ncomputation.\n\nA different example is Schwarz Methods for linear boundary\nvalue problems. These have existed for over 100 years, but are being\n``rediscovered'' because they are so suitable for parallel computers\n\nA project on this topic would mainly involve programming and algorithm\ndesign. Code could be tested on some Linux computers running software to\nemulate parallel and distributed systems.\n\nThe student who does this project should like programming.\nIt would be useful\nto have studied numerical analysis.\n\n4. Simulating Small-World Networks\n\nMany networks that occur naturally have two properties: clustering and\nshort average path-lengths. This is called the small world\nphenomenon and is related to research activities in very diverse\nareas. To verify this, check a web search engine for such topics as\nSix Degrees of Separation and The Kevin Bacon Game\n\nA student working on this project will, at the very least, read\na number of articles on the topic, learn enough mathematics to\nunderstand some of the theorems and conjectures in the area, and write\nsome computer programs to simulate these networks.\n\nThe project would suit a student with interests in programming and\ngraph theory. Some knowledge is stochastic processes and Markov chains\nwould be useful.\n\n5. Topics in Numerical Analysis\n\nNumerical Analysis is the area of mathematics that is concerned\nwith the design and analysis of methods and algorithms for obtaining\nuseful solutions to mathematical problems. Two of the main sources of\nproblems are differential equations and linear algebra. The\napplications are far too numerous to mention.\n\nThe interested student should browse a few books in the library.

The assignments use two frames.\nThe upper frame has the instructions and a form for your responses;\nthe bottom frame has tools you might need to solve the problems, such\nas graphs, calculators, etc.\n\nTo access the assignments, you must provide the following\nidentifying information:\n\nlast name, first name, student ID, email address.\n\nAt the bottom of the instruction frame, after all the questions,\nthere are three buttons: one to submit the assignment for grading,\none to save your intermediate results on your computer, and one to\nclear the answer form.\n\nYou must click the submit button to send your\nanswers to be graded.\n\nAfter you click the submit button, you must\nclick another button to confirm that you really want to submit\nyour answers for grading.\n\nYou will get confirmation in this window of your browser that your\nassignment was received by the server (a message from AutoGrader).\nYour score will be posted to the web.\n\nAfter the due date, there will be no \"submit\"\nbutton. If the submit button is missing, but the assignment\nis not yet due, the clock on your computer is set incorrectly.\n\nTo see your grades, you\nneed to enter your name, email address and SID, to protect your\nprivacy. Click the button just under the assignment list, near the\ntop of this page. Also, if you go back to the assignment after the\ndue date, you can see the correct answers to your unique version of\nthe assignment.\n\nYou can save intermediate results on the assignment using a button\nat the bottom of the instruction page. The assignments also save\nthemselves on your computer when you submit them, if you have your\nbrowser configured to accept cookies. That lets you resubmit the same\nanswers again in case, for some reason, your submission does not get\nto the server, and lets you see your answers with the correct answers\nconveniently, after the due date. Note: cookies are not very\nreliable. Some things will cause or require your cookies to be\ndeleted. To use the save feature, you must use the same computer\nevery time you work on a given assignment. You can use\ndifferent computers for different assignments. After filling out the\nidentifying information at the top of this page to access the\nassignments, the computer will look for a record of your previous\nwork on the assignment on the computer you are using.\nIf it finds your previous work, the assignment will have your\nprevious answers filled in. If it does not find your previous work,\nthe answer fields will be blank. Many of the questions and data in\nassignments are generated randomly. Different students get different\nquestions and different data. You are scored based on the questions\nand data you receive.\n\nQuestions with multiple-choice answers. There are\ntwo types of questions with multiple-choice answers. The first kind\nallows you to select only one response. The second kind asks you to\n\"select all that apply.\" How to select more than one answer\ndepends on the computer operating system and browser. In Netscape and\nFirefox on unix systems, click each answer you want to select;\nclicking an answer again de-selects it. On Windows systems, hold down\nthe control (ctrl) key while clicking each response to select more\nthan one. On Macintosh systems, hold down the \"apple\" key\nto select multiple responses. In such \"multiple-multiple-choice\"\nquestions, if you select an answer that is not correct, or fail to\nselect one that is correct, you will not receive credit--there is no\npartial credit.\n\nNumerical answers. The grader strips commas from\nnumbers, so you are free to punctuate numerical responses. If your\nresponse includes a percent sign at the end, your numerical answer\nwill be converted to a percentage (divided by 100). Scientific\nnotation (e.g., 4.23e-7 as shorthand for 0.000000423) will work; do\nnot put a space between the digits and the letter \"e.\"\nQuestions that do not have an exact numerical answer accept a small\nrange of answers as correct. The precision required depends on the\nproblem statement. When in doubt, don't round off your final answer.\nIn this class, there is no such thing as an answer that is \"too\nprecise.\" Never round off intermediate calculations:\nsee Assignment 0.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nMost technical problems with the online book and assignments\nhave one of three causes:\n\nClearing Cookies\n\nCookies are small text files stored on your computer.

{"text":"Mathematical Modes of Thought\n\nOverview\n\nThis is a course in modern mathematics. We will be exploring a number of topics that have been developed fairly recently in the mathematical world.\n\nThis class will be nothing like your intermediate algebra course. If you prefer equations and expressions, this is not the class for you. We will be looking at topics that might not seem like math to you. Many of these topics will be explored in context of their applications.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to expose you to the wider world of mathematical thinking. There are two reasons for this. First, for you to understand the power of quantitative thinking and the power of numbers in solving and dealing with real world scenarios. Secondly, for you to understand that there is more to mathematics then expressions and equations.\n\nTechnical Expectations\n\nTo be successful in this course, you will need some technical skills. Most important is access to a computer with a reliable internet connection, and the ability to operate that computer and a web browser. If you are reading this, you're probably OK for this part. There will be a couple assignments that ask you to upload files, cut-and-paste internet addresses (URLs), etc. In most cases, a non-technical alternative is available if needed.\n\nIs this course right for you?\n\nMath 1080 is a terminal math course, meaning it does not prepare you for any other math class. This course is intended only for people who will be seeing only one mathematics class in college.\n\nHopefully you went to an adviser who knows your educational goals when deciding which class to take. If you're not sure if this class is right for you, please feel free to email me and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\nTextbook\n\nI got tired of students having to pay over $100 for the book. So instead of using a traditional textbook, a book written by a friend from graduate school, David Lippman. The textbook is available online at  and is free.\n\nFormat of the Course\n\nEach week there will be a specific set of material to learn, and assignments and tests on that material. There will be fixed due-dates for those assignments. However, the course is asynchronous, which means that you can log in any time during the week that is convenient for you and complete the assignments.\n\nIn addition to lecture, each week, you will be given a reading assignment. Attending Lectures and reading the textbook will be your primary way to learn the material for the course.\n\nDuring class there will be frequent assignment, these can range from quizzes to group work. These assignments cannot be made up and make up a significant portion of your grade.\n\nOutside of class a discussion forum will be provided where you can ask questions about the reading, and discuss the material with me and your classmates.In class you can ask me and we can discuss any problems you are having. Usually if you are having trouble, others are as well.\n\nThere will be a set of homework exercises assigned each week. The online homework exercises are required, and graded. However, if you miss a question, it will show the answer, allowing you to self-diagnose your mistake, and then you can try similar problems until you get the questions correct. You can ask questions in the discussion board about any homework questions you have difficulty with.\n\nFor each section there will be a \"Skills Quiz\". This will be a test consisting of problems similar, but not necessarily identical, to the homework problems, that test your understanding of the material and your ability to perform any procedures or techniques presented in that chapter. These questions will be numerical, multiple-choice, matching, or fill-in-the-blank.\n\nAdditionally, each week there will be an assignment not from the book. This assignment will be a more open-ended question that usually requires a bit more work, conceptual understanding, possibly some outside research, and may require a written solution or explanation. In some cases these may be collaborative assignments with intermediary due dates in the middle of the week. Be sure to keep track of the due dates.\n\nExcept in the case of collaborative assignments requiring feedback to fellow students, there are no graded forum response, email, or log-in frequency requirements. However, I strongly encourage you to not wait until the last day of the week to begin your assignments, as this does not allow time to seek out assistance if needed.\n\nMidway through the course there will be a midterm exam and at the end of the course there will a final exam.\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nThe course learning outcomes (aka objectives) describe what abilities and skills a successful student is expected to develop and demonstrate in this course. While often related, these are separate from the course content (the specific topics we'll be covering)\n\nDemonstrate a positive attitude towards mathematics and an appreciation for its power and uses.\n\nExplore new and unfamiliar problems and employ critical thinking skills.\n\nForm and communicate generalizations discovered through individual or group investigations.\n\nCommunicate methods of solutions and solutions to problems for the clarity of the receiver.\n\nModel and solve problems using graphical methods.\n\nAnalyze and interpret data, as well as calculate statistical mean and median and use these to describe data.\n\nRepresent data using a histogram and/or other graphical forms.\n\nSolve problems using algorithms or formulas.\n\nExamine multicultural perspectives of at least one mathematical topic studied.\n\nSolve, analyze, and effectively communicate the solution to problems of the instructor's choice.\n\nParticipate actively and responsibly in all course activities.\n\nWithin each sections folder, you will find a list of that sections topic-based learning outcomes, and how they related back to these course outcomes. You will be able to meet these learning outcomes by reading the book, making sure you understand the examples in the book, and working through the online exercises, seeking out assistance if you have difficulties. You will, of course, also need to apply your critical thinking skills, since part of the purpose of this course is to expand your ability apply the skills you've learned to new and different scenarios. In real life, problems rarely tell you how to solve them :)\n\nLate Work Policy\n\nThe online Homework and Skills Test deadlines are extremely firm. The link to these assignments will actually disappear at midnight on the due date, and the assignment must be completed before midnight. Because of this, I strongly recommend that students not wait until 11:50pm to start the test, in case if they have problems logging in or something.\n\nThe Graded Assignments deadlines are also very firm, since you have the entire week to work on them. If a graded assignment is turned in late, I will never give more than 50% of the possible points.\n\nIf something major comes up (a death in the family, hospitalization, etc.), go ahead and email me or call me to let me know, and we can work something out.\n\nGetting Help\n\nThe discussion board is a forum where you can ask questions about the reading or homework, and get help from me or your classmates. The idea is to have the class operate like a study group - with all of you working together to further your learning. This is what distinguishes an online class from a traditional distance learning or math lab course.\n\nUse the Discussion Board to ask for help on problems you don't understand how to do. If you do understand how to do the problems, help out your classmates by answering questions on the discussion board.\n\nI will monitor the homework discussion boards, and will respond to questions if they go unanswered, or if someone provides an incorrect response. If you have additional questions, didn't understand the answer someone gave you, or have a question that has gone unanswered, don't hesitate to email me and ask questions. However, please use the discussion boards first, so that others can benefit from your questions.\n\nI can't stress enough that without being able to see the expression on your face, there's no way for me to judge if you understand my or a fellow student's explanation to your questions. So, you need to be proactive about your learning, and ask for more explanation when you need it. Again, you can do this via email to me, or in the discussion boards.\n\nIn addition to the discussion board and emailing me, you are also welcome to come see me on-campus if your schedule allows. See the Instructor Information to see what my office hours are this quarter.\n\nAdditionally, you can get help from the drop-in tutors at the Academic Support Center on either campus. Be aware that not all tutors have taken this math course, and may have difficulty helping you. Writing tutors are also available to help with writing assignments.\n\nInstructor Contact\n\nYou can contact me via the discussion boards, email, messages, by phone, or in person.\n\nIf you have general questions about the course, you can ask them in the \"Ask John\" discussion forum. If the question is of a personal nature, feel free to email me.\n\nIf you have questions about the homework or readings, you can ask them in class. Feel free to email me, call me, or visit me in my office for additional help.\n\nWhen you post a message or email me, please understand that I am not online all the time. Please allow at least 24 hours for me to respond to your questions, possibly longer on the weekends (up to 48 hours).\n\nGrading\n\nThe first week of class there is a bio assignment and syllabus quiz.\n\nEach week you will have online Homework.\n\nEach section you will have a Skills Quiz.\n\nEach section there will be a written/extended assignment.\n\nThere will be a midterm and final test.\n\nThe midterm exam will count 20% of your course grade.\n\nIn class assignments will count 20% of your course grade.\n\nOnline homework will count for 15% of your course grade.\n\nSkills Quizzes will count for 15% of your course grade.\n\nWritten assignments will count for 15% of your course grade.\n\nThe Final will count for 20% of your course grade.\n\nYour weighted percent in the class will be converted to a decimal grade via this scale:\n\n90-100%: 3.5-4.0\n\n80-89% : 2.5-3.4\n\n75-79% : 2.0-2.4\n\n70-74%: 1.5-1.9\n\n60-69%: 0.7-1.4\n\nBelow 60%: 0.0\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nOnline courses have the same academic integrity as any other college course. You can trust that I will respond to your questions and comments in a timely manner, as well as be timely and fair in grading submitted assignments.\n\nAs your instructor, I trust that you will make your best effort to complete the activities in a timely manner and to the best of your abilities. If there is an unforeseen change in your schedule feel free to contact me for alternative arrangements. I expect that the work you submit for this course will be your own work. Cheating and/or plagiarism will not be tolerated. Please refer to the college's Academic Dishonesty policy for more details.\n\nOnline Etiquette\n\nMuch has been written about online etiquette. The old saying, \"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\" is suddenly untrue. Words are our sole means of communication. Many times a sarcastic phrase you make to a friend is softened with a smile or eye contact. In an online situation, that same phrase can be very hurtful if read differently. Remember treat everyone the same way you would want to be treated: with respect.\n\nThere are ways to express emotions without words. These are called emoticons. You've probably seen several already in computer writing: ;-) :) :o) :-( etc., These are actually faces turned on their side to represent emotions. They take the place of body language and facial expressions that are a natural part of communication. In this setting, it's difficult sometimes to discern between sarcasm and criticism. Using emoticons can often convey the context of the comment when words can't.\n\nMost importantly, this class will be free of sexual, verbal, and racial discrimination or harassment.\n\nNC Policy\n\nThe NC policy has changed beginning with this semester. For a\n100% refund the date is August 23 and for a 50% refund the date is\nSeptember 1. The last day to obtain an NC is Friday Oct. 23. This\nis a hard deadline and will be enforced as such. The department\nwill not approve any late NC requests. Students must request an\nNC through MetroConnect; faculty approval is no longer required.\nHolidays: Observance of religious holidays follows College policy, which is\nposted on the web at  in the Academic\nand Campus Policies for Students section. Each student is responsible\nfor understanding and abiding by the policy.\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities:\nThe Metropolitan State College of Denver is committed to making reasonable accommodations to assist individuals with disabilities in reaching their academic potential. If you have a disability that may impact your performance, attendance, or grades in this class and are requesting accommodations, then you must first register with the Access\nCenter, located in the Auraria Library, Suite 116, 303-556-8387. Faculty Notification Letter, I would be happy to meet with you to discuss your accommodations. All discussions will remain confidential.

In Professor James A. Sellers' engaging course, Mastering the Fundamentals of Mathematics, you learn all the key math topics you need to know. In 24 lectures packed with helpful examples, practice problems, and guided walkthroughs, you'll finally grasp the all-important fundamentals of math in a way that truly sticks.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n24\nLectures\n30\nminutes/lecture\n\n1.\nAddition and Subtraction\nThis introductory lecture starts with Professor Sellers' overview of the general topics and themes you'll encounter throughout the course. Then, plunge into an engaging review of the addition and subtraction of whole numbers, complete with several helpful tips designed to help you approach these types of problems with more confidence.\n\n13.\nExponents and Order of Operations\nExplore a fifth fundamental mathematical operation: exponentiation. First, take a step-by-step look at the order of operations for handling longer calculations that involve multiple tasks—complete with invaluable tips to help you handle them with ease. Then, see where exponentiation fits in this larger process.\n\n2.\nMultiplication\nContinue your quick review of basic mathematical operations, this time with a focus on the multiplication of whole numbers. In addition to uncovering the relationship between addition and multiplication, you'll get plenty of opportunities to strengthen your ability to multiply two 2-digit numbers, two 3-digit numbers, and more.\n\n14.\nNegative and Positive Integers\nImprove your confidence in dealing with negative numbers. You'll learn to use the number line to help visualize these numbers; discover how to rewrite subtraction problems involving negative numbers as addition problems to make them easier; examine the rules involved in multiplying and dividing with them; and much more.\n\n3.\nLong Division\nTurn now to the opposite of multiplication: division. Learn how to properly set up a long division problem, how to check your answers to make sure they're correct, how to handle zeroes when they appear in a problem, and what to do when a long division problem ends with a remainder.\n\n15.\nIntroduction to Square Roots\nIn this lecture, finally make sense of square roots. Professor Sellers offers examples to help you sidestep issues many students express frustration with, shows you how to simplify radical expressions involving addition and subtraction, and reveals how to find the approximate value of a square root without using a calculator.\n\n4.\nIntroduction to Fractions\nMathematics is also filled with \"parts\" of whole numbers, or fractions. In the first of several lectures on fractions, define key terms and focus on powerful techniques for determining if fractions are equivalent, finding out which of two fractions is larger, and reducing fractions to their lowest terms.\n\n16.\nNegative and Fractional Powers\nWhat happens when you have to raise numbers to a fraction of a power? How about when you have to deal with negative exponents? Or negative fractional exponents? No need to worry —Professor Sellers guides you through this tricky mathematical territory, arming you with invaluable techniques for approaching these scenarios.\n\n5.\nAdding and Subtracting Fractions\nFractions with the same denominator. Fractions with different denominators. Mixed numbers. Here, learn ways to add and subtract them all (and sometimes even in the same problem) and get tips for reducing your answers to their lowest terms. Math with fractions, you'll discover, doesn't have to be intimidating—it can even be fun!\n\n17.\nGraphing in the Coordinate Plane\nGrab some graph paper and learn how to graph objects in the coordinate (or xy) plane. You'll find out how to plot points, how to determine which quadrant they go in, how to sketch the graph of a line, how to determine a line's slope, and more.\n\n6.\nMultiplying Fractions\nContinue having fun with fractions, this time by mastering how to multiply them and reduce your answer to its lowest term. Professor Sellers shows you how to approach and solve multiplication problems involving fractions (with both similar and different denominators), fractions and whole numbers, and fractions and mixed numbers.\n\n18.\nGeometry—Triangles and Quadrilaterals\nContinue exploring the visual side of mathematics with this look at the basics of two-dimensional geometry. Among the topics you'll focus on here are the various types of triangles (including scalene and obtuse triangles) and quadrilaterals (such as rectangles and squares), as well as methods for measuring angles, area, and perimeter.\n\n7.\nDividing Fractions\nProfessor Sellers walks you step-by-step through the process for speedily solving division problems involving fractions in this lecture filled with helpful practice problems. You'll also learn how to better handle calculations involving different notations, fractions, and whole numbers, and even word problems involving the division of fractions.\n\n19.\nGeometry—Polygons and Circles\nGain a greater appreciation for the interaction between arithmetic and geometry. First, learn how to recognize and approach large polygons, including hexagons and decagons. Then, explore the various concepts behind circles (such as radius, diameter, and the always intriguing pi), as well as methods for calculating their circumference, area, and perimeter.\n\n8.\nAdding and Subtracting Decimals\nWhat's 29.42 + 84.67? Or 643 + 82.987? What about 25.7 – 10.483? Problems like these are the focus of this helpful lecture on adding and subtracting decimals. One tip for making these sorts of calculations easier: making sure your decimal points are all lined up vertically.\n\n20.\nNumber Theory—Prime Numbers and Divisors\nShift gears and demystify number theory, which takes as its focus the study of the properties of whole numbers. Concepts that Professor Sellers discusses and teaches you how to engage with in this insightful lecture include divisors, prime numbers, prime factorizations, greatest common divisors, and factor trees.\n\n9.\nMultiplying and Dividing Decimals\nInvestigate the best ways to multiply and divide decimal numbers. You'll get insights into when and when not to ignore the decimal point in your calculations, how to check your answer to ensure that your result has the correct number of decimal places, and how to express remainders in decimals.\n\n21.\nNumber Theory—Divisibility Tricks\nIn this second lecture on the world of number theory, take a closer look at the relationships between even and odd numbers, as well as the rules of divisibility for particular numbers.

{"text":"Integral Calculus: An Introduction to the Anti-Derivative\n\nIf a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable. The function for which the integral is calculated is called the integrand. The region over which a function is being integrated is called the domain of integration.\n\nIn this class, the presenter will introduce the concept of Integration. We will describe it as simply, the reverse process of differentiation, hence, also called Anti-Differentiation.\n\nThe integral may be found without a definite specification or for a particular region leading to the development of indefinite & definite integrals. In case of the definite integrals, the domain of integration is defined by specifying the upper & lower limits of the enclosed region. Also, definite integrals may not be referred to as anti-derivatives which is a term used only for indefinite integrals in accordance with the fundamental theorem of calculus. Besides, the indefinite integral may be a constant or a function of the independent variable however, the definite integral is always constant.\n\nWe will also discuss about the geometrical & physical representation & significance of the integral. When we look into the practical applications of integrals, they appear in a number of practical situations.\n\nConsider a swimming pool. If it is rectangular, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. The best of problems in Physics too involve the integral.\n\nAbout Rishabh Dev (Teacher)\n\nRishabh Dev is a teacher in Calculus & other mathematics disciplines. Dev has a remarkable style of delivering the very advanced math concepts useful for the various competitive exams in a very basic manner understandable to all.\n\nHe has developed innovative ways of teaching mathematics to his students.

{"text":"rational functions take two\n\nTwo weeks ago in my Algebra 2 Trig Honors class we were finishing up our unit on rational expressions, equations, and functions. In past years, students at this level had focused on graphing only simple rational functions – transformations of y=1/x. (In Precalculus, students are exposed to general rational functions.) I was feeling frustrated, though, at how limited this approach felt – I didn't want students to be misled into ignoring the big vast ocean full of rational functions after looking at a goldfish bowl-sized sample. (Questions like: \"so it will always look like this?\" were driving me crazy.) But at the same time, I didn't want to bog them down with a tedious approach to graphing general cases by hand. I just wanted my students to get a feel for all of the different crazy shapes these graphs can make, notice patterns, and begin the process of generalizing.\n\nLast year I had included an investigation of general rational functions using Wolfram Alpha on a homework assignment. In hindsight, leaving this activity for homework wasn't a good call – there wasn't enough time for thoughtful follow-up, and by having students work alone they missed out on the magic of discussing their findings with others and building understanding together. So this year, I took an extra class day to allow students time to play around with more complicated rational functions on the Desmos calculator. (Which I am a little bit in love with.)\n\nIn my 2nd period class, I didn't do a great job of setting up and explaining what I had envisioned for the hour. I showed them the Desmos calculator, told them they should be graphing a variety of rational functions, and gave them a sheet with 4 specific examples with bullet points for guided questions underneath to use as a framework for their investigation. On the back board, I had written \"What do you notice/what are you wondering about…\" with different categories for them to record some of their findings throughout the hour. The idea was that throughout class, I would circulate and peek in on their conversations, help answer some questions or poke at their thinking a bit, they would record their observations and questions on the back board, and at the end of class we'd save 10 minutes to discuss our findings on the board.\n\nAs I turned students loose to begin working, some problems became evident pretty quickly. While students were comfortable recognizing the one vertical and one horizontal asymptote for simple rational functions, they couldn't \"see\" the asymptotes for the more complicated graphs. This to me indicated that they didn't have a good enough understanding of what an asymptote truly was, but instead had mastered an algorithm for graphing the simple rational functions. I tried to chat with groups of students to see where the disconnect was, and I encouraged students to graph the lines that they visually predicted were asymptotes – then connect that to the algebra of each function. I also realized I had not done a good job explaining or modeling the way they should record what they noticed/wondered on the back board – I ended up with lots of random pictures and little interpretation or generalizations. I also did a horrible job keeping track of the timing of the class. It became clear we weren't going to have the 10 minutes I wanted at the end of class to pull together our big findings – instead, I had to take pictures of the back board and wait until the next day to summarize their investigation.\n\nThere were more nuanced conversations than the sloppy work on the board indicated, but overall I wasn't happy with the way things had gone. I didn't feel like we had arrived at enough clarity or closure for the big ideas I wanted them to be tackling.\n\nLucky for me, I learned a bit from my mistakes and in my 4th period class I did a MUCH better job of setting up the activity. I graphed the first specific example on Desmos, talked through how I could visually \"see\" the 2 vertical asymptotes and 1 horizontal asymptote, showed them to graph those lines to confirm the asymptotic behavior, returned to the algebra of the example function to make connections between the algebra and the graph, then added a generalization to the board of noticing/wondering.\n\nDuring this hour, the students did a better job of working together, asked me fewer questions, and were more able to generalize their findings. They even surprised me with some observations I was *not* expecting them to make (see the last one under \"V.A.\") and a few students figured out how to use sliders with Desmos to more efficiently explore how changing different bits of the function they graphed would impact its shape. You can tell by looking at their noticings/wonderings how much more successful my second shot at this lesson was. During the follow-up conversation at the end of class, I addressed all of the points on the board, asked for students to help respond to some of the questions, and felt that the majority of students left with a better understanding of both the important features of these graphs and how the algebra of the functions controls their shape.\n\nSince I first started this post a week ago (sorry, February is the worst), I have now given the test for this unit. General rational functions were not tested (only transformations of y=1/x), but I did decide to include a question that had students explain the shape of the parent function y=1/x. It was a great way for me to see if all of the investigation and conversation about the shapes of the graphs had paid off… were my students more \"mathematically fluent\" in the vocabulary and ideas associated with rational functions? I did have some very strong responses, and I've included my favorite below.\n\nI'm sure there are ways for me to tweak and improve upon this lesson for future classes, but I was happy with the chance it afforded students to talk, play, investigate, and generalize.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nResponses\n\nSome comments and questions here\n* Love the guided questions along the way. Do you intend to move away from the more specific clues? Is the unit long enough for that?\n* Love the writing on the second set of board snapshots. Why is it that students are so determined to misspell the word vertical even when it is in the question that they are answering?\n* In addition to division for slant asymptotes, do you suggest division as a way to get at horizontal asymptotes as well?\n* How comfortable are your kids with 'washing away the remainder' in these processes?\n* I am intrigued by DESMOS – haven't used it. I'm partial to GeoGebra myself.\n\nI like how you have students put their observations on the board – I'm not sure my algebra students are persistent enough in their investigations, but I would like to try something similar to this in Geometry. Have you ever done it with a class that is not honors?\n\nNo, that was actually my first time to have students record observations on the board like this. You can see how much better I modeled for students the types of things they should be recording in the 2nd class. I think I would be comfortable doing something like this in a non-honors class, but the investigation activity would have to be much more structured – I was asking a lot, conceptually, of my students here.","id":"/841","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.948320209980011,"__label__0":0.051699794828891754}}

I will use this site to post all assignments, class notes, solutions, and items of interest for each of my classes.\n\nAP Physics C Electricity & Magnetism\n\nA rigorous calculus-based physics course is an essential requirement for every student in the field of engineering or the physical sciences. This course will provide you with the opportunity to apply calculus to the physical principles underlying the laws of nature. Major emphasis is on problem solving with laboratory work and class demonstrations to provide data for developing analytical models that can be understood and manipulated mathematically.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, linear algebra/matrix theory is an absolute requirement. Linear Algebra is the mathematical study of vectors and vector spaces (also called linear spaces). Matrices are widely used to represent the linear transformations that input one vector and output another. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Calculus. The only REAL prerequisite for this material is a good knowledge of high school algebra. We have designated AB Calculus as a requirement because everyone will need strong algebra skills and good analytical ability. Linear Algebra has many practical applications, not limited to math/physics/engineering. It shows up in economics, logistics, finance, computer science, operations research, and lots of other disciplines.\n\nFor students desiring to study mathematics, engineering, physics, or chemistry at the university level, advanced calculus is an absolute requirement. Currently, you have received a solid foundation in Advanced Placement Calculus AB & BC. The material in these courses however, has generally been limited to one independent variable expressed in the form of y = f(x). Multivariable/vector calculus is used to describe phenomena that result from the simultaneous effects of many variables. For example, in the case of the ideal gas law from chemistry, the pressure of an ideal gas is a result of the number of moles of the gas, the volume of the container, and the temperature. We could express this as P = f(n,V,T). If all three are changed simultaneously, how is the pressure changed?\n\nPre-AP PreCalculus provides opportunities to study real numbers, functions and their graphs, trigonometric relationships, parametric representations, sequences, and series. This course provides the necessary foundation for advanced placement or college calculus. Extends and builds on the foundation for the Advanced Placement program. Includes all of the regular Precalculus course with extensions, both guided and independent, in the areas of symbolic logic, linear programming, applications of polar coordinates, and topics from discrete mathematics. Typically, after taking Pre-AP PreCalculus a student would take AP Statistics and/or AP Calculus AB.","id":"/844","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.990790069103241,"__label__0":0.009229895658791065}}

{"text":"While I do think that many pop-sci explanations of theoretical physics are fairly worthless and often actively misleading, I do not think that it is impossible to gain real insight into (say) the general theory of relativity without mastering differential geometry. Geroch's book presupposes only high school mathematics, but it provides a genuinely deep insight into relativity.\n\nI described the requirements as algebra, analytic geometry, and basic calculus, which is more or less within advanced high-school math. (Without calculus, I don't see how you could explain integrals along the world line, which are the very heart of the matter.)\n\nHowever, note that just high-school algebra is already worlds apart from purely prose-based, general-audience pop-science.

{"text":"Elementary\nMathematics Courses. In order to accommodate diverse\nbackgrounds and interests, several course options are available\nto beginning mathematics students. All courses require three years\nof high school mathematics; four years are strongly recommended\nand more information is given for some individual courses below.\nStudents with College Board Advanced Placement credit and anyone\nplanning to enroll in an upper-level class should consider one\nof the Honors\nsequences and discuss the options with a mathematics advisor.\n\nStudents who need additional preparation for calculus are tentatively\nidentified by a combination of the math placement test (given\nduring orientation), college admission test scores (SAT or ACT), and high school grade point average. Academic advisors will discuss\nthis placement information with each student and refer students\nto a special mathematics advisor when necessary.\n\nTwo courses preparatory to the calculus, MATH 105 and 110, are offered. MATH 105 is a course on data analysis, functions\nand graphs with an emphasis on problem solving. MATH 110 is a\ncondensed half-term version of the same material offered as a\nself-study course taught through the Math Lab and is only open\nto students in MATH 115 who find that they need additional preparation\nto successfully complete the course. A maximum total of 4 credits\nmay be earned in courses numbered 103, 105, and 110. MATH 103\nis offered exclusively in the Summer half-term for students in\nthe Summer Bridge Program.\n\nMATH 127 and 128 are courses containing selected topics from\ngeometry and number theory, respectively. They are intended for\nstudents who want exposure to mathematical culture and thinking\nthrough a single course. They are neither prerequisite nor preparation\nfor any further course. No credit will be received for the election\nof MATH 127 or 128 if a student already has credit for a 200-(or\nhigher) level MATH course.\n\nEach of MATH 115, 185, and 295 is a first course in calculus.\nGenerally credit can be received for only one of 115 or 185. The\nsequence MATH 115-116-215 is appropriate for must students who\nwant a complete introduction to calculus. One of 215, 285, or\n395 is prerequisite to most more advanced courses in Mathematics.\n\nThe sequences MATH 156-255-256, 175-186-285-286, 185-186-285-286, and 295-296-395-396 are Honors sequences. Students need not be\nenrolled in the LS&A Honors Program to enroll in any of these\ncourses but must have the permission of an Honors advisor. Students\nwith strong preparation and interest in mathematics are encouraged\nto consider these courses.\n\nMATH 185-285 covers much of the material of MATH 115-215 with\nmore attention to the theory in addition to applications. Most\nstudents who take MATH 185 have taken a high school calculus course, but it is not required. MATH 175-186 assumes a knowledge of calculus\nroughly equivalent to MATH 115 and covers a substantial amount\nof so-called combinatorial mathematics as well as calculus-related\ntopics not usually part of the calculus sequence. MATH 175 is\ntaught by the discovery method: students are presented with a\ngreat variety of problems and encouraged to experiment in groups\nusing computers. The sequence MATH 295-396 provides a rigorous\nintroduction to theoretical mathematics. Proofs are stressed over\napplications and these courses require a high level of interest\nand commitment. Most students electing MATH 295 have completed\na thorough high school calculus course. MATH 295-396 is excellent\npreparation for mathematics at the advanced undergraduate and\nbeginning graduate level.\n\nStudents with strong scores on either the AB or BC version\nof the College Board Advanced Placement exam may be granted credit\nand advanced placement in one of the sequences described above;\na table explaining the possibilities is available from advisors\nand the Department. In addition, there is one course expressly\ndesigned and recommended for students with one or two semesters\nof AP credit, MATH 156. MATH 156 is an Honors course intended\nprimarily for science and engineering concentrators and will emphasize\nboth applications and theory. Interested students should consult\na mathematics advisor for more details.\n\nIn rare circumstances and with permission of a Mathematics\nadvisor, reduced credit may be granted for MATH 185 after MATH\n115. A list of these and other cases of reduced credit for courses\nwith overlapping material is available from the Department. To\navoid unexpected reduction in credit, a student should always consult\nan advisor before switching from one sequence to another. In all\ncases a maximum total of 16 credits may be earned for calculus\ncourses MATH 115 through 396, and no credit can be earned for\na prerequisite to a course taken after the course itself.\n\nStudents completing MATH 116 who are principally interested\nin the application of mathematics to other fields may continue\neither to MATH 215 (Analytic Geometry and Calculus III) or to\nMATH 216 (Introduction to Differential Equations); these two courses\nmay be taken in either order. Students who have greater interest\nin theory or who intend to take more advanced courses in mathematics\nshould continue with MATH 215 followed by the sequence MATH 217-316\n(Linear Algebra-Differential Equations). MATH 217 (or the Honors\nversion, MATH 513) is required for a concentration in Mathematics;\nit both serves as a transition to the more theoretical material\nof advanced courses and provides the background required to optimal\ntreatment of differential equations in MATH 316. MATH 216 is not\nintended for mathematics concentrators.\n\nA maximum total of 4 credits may be earned in MATH 103, 105, and 110. A maximum total of 16 credits may be earned for calculus courses MATH 112 through MATH 396, and no credit can be earned for a prerequisite to a course taken after the course itself.\n\nMATH 103. Intermediate Algebra.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Only open to designated summer half-term Bridge students. (Excl). May not be repeated for credit. A maximum of four credits may be earned in MATH 101, 103, 105, and 110.\n\nMATH 105. Data, Functions, and Graphs.\n\nTHERE ARE JOINT EVENING EXAMS FOR ALL SECTIONS of MATH 105: WED, OCT 1 & MON, NOV 3, 6-8PM. ALSO A JOINT FINAL. CAUTION! AVOID SCHEDULING ANOTHER CLASS THAT CONFLICTS WITH THESE EVENING EXAMS.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: (4). (MSA). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit.Credits: (4).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nMATH 105 serves both as a preparatory course to the calculus sequences and as a terminal course for students who need only this level of mathematics. Students who complete MATH 105 are fully prepared for MATH 115.MATH 110. Pre-Calculus (Self-Study).Instructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: See Elementary Courses above. Enrollment in MATH 110 is by recommendation of MATH 115 instructor and override only. (2). (Excl). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who already have 4 credits for pre-calculus mathematics courses. A maximum of four credits may be earned in MATH 101, 103, 105, and 110.\n\nCredits: (2).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThe course covers data analysis by means of functions and graphs. MATH 110 serves both as a preparatory class to the calculus sequences and as a terminal course for students who need only this level of mathematics. The course is a condensed, half-term version of MATH 105 (MATH 105 covers the same material in a traditional classroom setting) designed for students who appear to be prepared to handle calculus but are not able to successfully complete MATH 115. Students who complete MATH 110 are fully prepared for MATH 115. Students may enroll in MATH 110 only on the recommendation of a mathematics instructor after the third week of classes.MATH 115. Calculus I.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Four years of high school mathematics. See Elementary Courses above. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit usually is granted for only one course from among 115, 185, and 295. No credit granted to those who have completed MATH 175 uniform midterm and final exam. The course presents the concepts of calculus from three points of view: geometric (graphs); numerical (tables); and algebraic (formulas). Students will develop their reading, writing, and questioning skills.\n\nTopics include functions and graphs, derivatives and their applications to real-life problems in various fields, and definite integrals. MATH 185 is a somewhat more theoretical course which covers some of the same material. MATH 175 includes some of the material of MATH 115 together with some combinatorial mathematics. A student whose preparation is insufficient for MATH 115 should take MATH 105 (Data, Functions, and Graphs). MATH 116 is the natural sequel. A student who has done very well in this course could enter the honors sequence at this point by taking MATH 186. The cost for this course is over $100 since the student will need a text (to be used for MATH 115 and 116) and a graphing calculator (the Texas Instruments TI-83 is recommended).\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 115. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit is granted for only one course from among MATH 116, 156, 176, and 186.\n\nCredits: (4).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.MATH 147. Introduction to Interest Theory.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 115. (3). (MSA). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed a 200- (or higher) level mathematics course.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis course is designed for students who seek an introduction to the mathematical concepts and techniques employed by financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. Actuarial students, and other mathematics concentrators should elect MATH 424, which covers the same topics but on a more rigorous basis requiring considerable use of calculus. Topics covered include: various rates of simple and compound interest, present and accumulated values based on these; annuity functions and their application to amortization, sinking funds, and bond values; depreciation methods; introduction to life tables, life annuity, and life insurance values. This course is not part of a sequence. Students should possess financial calculators.\n\nMATH 156. Applied Honors Calculus II.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Score of 4 or 5 on the AB or BC Advanced Placement calculus exam. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit is granted for only one course among MATH 116, 156, 176, 186, and 296.\n\nMath 156 is a 2nd term Honors calculus course for engineering and science students. The course emphasizes applications of calculus, computational skills, and conceptual understanding. The\nprerequisite is a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement calculus AB or BC exam. Math 156 provides students with the calculus background they need for subsequent courses in engineering, math, and\nscience.\n\nThe aim of Math 156 is to provide students with the math background they need for\nsubsequent courses. Math 156 strikes a balance between theory and application. Theorems\nare stated carefully and several are proven, but technical details are omitted (though\nreference is made to higher-level math courses where such issues are discussed). The\nproofs are presented in easily understood steps, based on the course coordinator's prior\nexperience. Examples are given to illustrate the theory.\n\nThe course starts by reviewing the definition of the integral as a limit of Riemann sums.\nThe students presumably have seen this topic in their AP class, but many comment that\nthe Math 156 treatment is different. The class moves quickly to topics that most students\nhaven't seen before, including improper integrals, and applications such as work, center of\nmass, arclength, surface area, hydrostatic force, and probability density functions. Math\n156 avoids the traditional segment on \"methods of integration for their own sake\"; instead\nthe methods are discussed as they arise in concrete problems. Taylor approximation is\ndiscussed in some depth with emphasis on applications the students will likely encounter\nin later courses (e.g., far-field expansion for the electrostatic potential of a pair of charged particles).\n\nPart I.

The class meets 4 times per week and each\nclass is 50 minutes long. There are uniform weekly homework assignments and uniform\nexams (two 90 minute midterms and one 2 hour final exam). The homework assignments\ninclude problems from the assigned text and customized problems. The students are introduced to MAPLE in a computer lab. There is brief exposure\nto special topics such as Bessel function, Gamma function, error function, fractal sets, Laplace transform, polar coordinates, complex numbers.\n\nText: \"Calculus\" by James Stewart, 5th edition, Brooks/Cole Publishing Company\n\nMATH 185. Honors Calculus I.\n\nSection 001, 002The sequence MATH 185-186-285-286 is the Honors introduction to calculus. It is taken by students intending to concentrate in mathematics, science, or engineering as well as students heading 185. Honors Calculus I.\n\nSection 003, 004Credits: (4).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThe sequence MATH 185-186-285-286 is the Honors introduction to calculus. It is taken by students intending to concentrate 214. Linear Algebra and Differential Equations.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 115 and 116This course is intended for second-year students who might otherwise take MATH 216 (Introduction to Differential Equations) but who have a greater need or desire to study Linear Algebra. This may include some Engineering students, particularly from Industrial and Operations engineering (IOE), as well as students of Economics and other quantitative social sciences. Students intending to concentrate in Mathematics must continue to elect MATH 217.\n\nWhile MATH 216 includes 3-4 weeks of Linear Algebra as a tool in the study of Differential Equations, MATH 214 will include roughly three weeks of Differential Equations as an application of Linear Algebra.\n\nMATH 215. Calculus III.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 116, 119, 156, 176, 186, or 296 midterm and final exam. Maple software. MATH 285 is a somewhat more theoretical course which covers the same material. For students intending to concentrate in mathematics or who have some interest in the theory of mathematics as well as its applications, the appropriate sequel is MATH 217. Students who intend to take only one further mathematics course and need differential equations should take MATH 216.\n\nMATH 216. Introduction to Differential Equations.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 116, 119, 156, 176, 186, or 296. Not intended for Mathematics concentrators. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. Credit can be earned for only one of MATH 216, 256, 286, or 316 engineering and the sciences. Math concentrators and other students who have some interest in the theory of mathematics should elect the sequence MATH 217-316. After an introduction to ordinary differential equations, the first half of the course is devoted to topics in linear algebra, including systems of linear algebraic equations, vector spaces, linear dependence, bases, dimension, matrix algebra, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. In the second half these tools are applied to the solution of linear systems of ordinary differential equations. Topics include: oscillating systems, the Laplace transform, initial value problems, resonance, phase portraits, and an introduction to numerical methods. There is a weekly computer lab using MATLAB software. This course is not intended for mathematics concentrators, who should elect the sequence MATH 217-316. MATH 286 covers much of the same material in the honors sequence. The sequence MATH 217-316 covers all of this material and substantially more at greater depth and with greater emphasis on the theory. MATH 404 covers further material on differential equations. MATH 217 and 417 cover further material on linear algebra. MATH 371 and 471 cover additional material on numerical methods.\n\nMATH 217. Linear Algebra.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215, 255, or 285 concentrators Therefore the student entering MATH 217 should come with a sincere interest in learning about proofs. The topics covered include: systems of linear equations; matrix algebra; vectors, vector spaces, and subspaces; geometry of Rn; linear dependence, bases, and dimension; linear transformations; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; diagonalization; and inner products. Throughout there will be emphasis on the concepts, logic, and methods of theoretical mathematics. MATH 417 and 419 cover similar material with more emphasis on computation and applications and less emphasis on proofs. MATH 513 covers more in a much more sophisticated way. The intended course to follow MATH 217 is 316. MATH 217 is also prerequisite for MATH 412 and all more advanced courses in mathematics.\n\nMATH 285. Honors Calculus III.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 176 or 186, or permission of the Honors advisorSee MATH 185 for a general description of the sequence MATH 185-186-285-286.\n\nTopics include vector algebra and vector functions; analytic geometry of planes, surfaces, and solids; functions of several variables and partial differentiation; maximum-minimum problems; line, surface, and volume integrals and applications; vector fields and integration; curl, divergence, and gradient; Green's Theorem and Stokes' Theorem. Additional topics may be added at the discretion of the instructor. MATH 215 is a less theoretical course which covers the same material.\n\nMATH 289. Problem Seminar.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nOne of the best ways to develop mathematical abilities is by solving problems using a variety of methods. Familiarity with numerous methods is a great asset to the developing student of mathematics. Methods learned in attacking a specific problem frequently find application in many other areas of mathematics. In many instances an interest in and appreciation of mathematics is better developed by solving problems than by hearing formal lectures on specific topics. The student has an opportunity to participate more actively in his/her education and development. This course is intended for superior students who have exhibited both ability and interest in doing mathematics, but it is not restricted to honors students. This course is excellent preparation for the Putnam exam. Students and one or more faculty and graduate student assistants will meet in small groups to explore problems in many different areas of mathematics. Problems will be selected according to the interests and background of the students.\n\nMATH 295. Honors Mathematics I.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Prior knowledge of first year calculus and permission of the Honors advisor. (4). (MSA). (BS). (QR/1). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 185.\n\nCredits: (4).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nMATH 295-296-395-396 is the main Honors calculus sequence. It is aimed at talented students who intend to major in mathematics, science, or engineering. The emphasis is on concepts and problem solving, as well as the underlying theory and proofs of important results. Students interested in taking advanced mathematical courses later should seriously consider starting with this sequence. The expected background is high school trigonometry and algebra (previous calculus not required). This sequence is not restricted to students enrolled in the LS&A Honors Program. Real functions, limits, continuous functions, limits of sequences, complex numbers, derivatives, indefinite integrals and applications, and some linear algebra. MATH 175 and MATH 185 are less intensive Honors courses. MATH 296 is the intended sequel.\n\nMATH 316. Differential Equations.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215 and 217. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. Credit can be earned for only one of MATH 216, 256, 286, or 316.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis is an introduction to differential equations for students who have studied linear algebra (MATH 217). It treats techniques of solution (exact and approximate), existence and uniqueness theorems, some qualitative theory, and many applications. Proofs are given in class; homework problems include both computational and more conceptually oriented problems. First-order equations: solutions, existence and uniqueness, and numerical techniques; linear systems: eigenvector-eigenvalue solutions of constant coefficient systems, fundamental matrix solutions, nonhomogeneous systems; higher-order equations, reduction of order, variation of parameters, series solutions; qualitative behavior of systems, equilibrium points, stability. Applications to physical problems are considered throughout. MATH 216 covers somewhat less material without the use of linear algebra and with less emphasis on theory. MATH 286 is the Honors version of MATH 316. MATH 471 and/or MATH 572 are natural sequels in the area of differential equations, but MATH 316 is also preparation for more theoretical courses such as MATH 451.\n\nMATH 333. Directed Tutoring.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Enrollment in the secondary teaching certificate program with concentration in mathematics. Permission of instructor required. (1-3). (Excl). (EXPERIENTIAL). May be repeated for credit for a maximum of 3 credits. Offered mandatory credit/no credit.\n\nCredits: (1-3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nAn experiential mathematics course for elementary teachers. Students tutor pre-calculus (Math. 105) or calculus (Math. 115) in the Math. Lab. They also participate in a bi-weekly seminar to discuss mathematical and methodological questions. Mandatory Credit/No Credit grading.\n\nMATH 371 / ENGR 371. Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: ENGR 101; one of MATH 216, 256, 286, or 316. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in Math 471This is a survey course of the basic numerical methods which are used to solve practical scientific problems.\nImportant concepts such as accuracy, stability, and efficiency are discussed. The course provides an introduction\nto MATLAB, an interactive program for numerical linear algebra.

Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers.\n\nInstructor(s):\nCarolyn A Dean\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: One year each of high school algebra and geometry. (3). (Excl). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 485.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nAll elementary teaching certificate candidates are required to take two\nmath courses, MATH 385 and MATH 489, either before or after admission to\nthe School of Education. MATH 385 is offered in the Fall Term, MATH 489\nin the Winter Term. Enrollment is limited to 30 students per section; class-size limits will be STRICTLY enforced. Anyone who can elect MATH 385 in the Spring Term is urged to do so. It is the surest way to guarantee yourself a place in the course.\n\nThis course, together with its sequel MATH 489, provides a coherent overview of the mathematics underlying the elementary and middle school curriculum. It is required of all students intending to earn an elementary teaching certificate and is taken almost exclusively by such students. Concepts are heavily emphasized with some attention given to calculation and proof. The course is conducted using a discussion format. Class participation is expected and constitutes a significant part of the course grade. Although only two years of high school mathematics are required, a more complete background including pre-calculus or calculus is desirable. Topics covered include problem solving, sets and functions, numeration systems, whole numbers (including some number theory), and integers. Each number system is examined in terms of its algorithms, its applications, and its mathematical structure. There is no alternative course. MATH 489 is the required sequel.\n\nMATH 395. Honors Analysis I.\n\nSection 001.\n\nInstructor(s):\nMario Bonk\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 296 or permission of the Honors advisor. (4). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (4).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis course is a continuation of the sequence MATH 295-296 and has the same theoretical emphasis. Students are expected to understand and construct proofs. This course studies functions of several real variables. Topics are chosen from elementary linear algebra (vector spaces, subspaces, bases, dimension, and solutions of linear systems by Gaussian elimination); elementary topology (open, closed, compact, and connected sets, and continuous and uniformly continuous functions); differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions of a scalar; differential and integral calculus of scalar-valued functions on Euclidean spaces; linear transformations (null space, range, matrices, calculations, linear systems, and norms); and differential calculus of vector-valued mappings on Euclidean spaces (derivative, chain rule, and implicit and inverse function theorems).\n\nMATH 404. Intermediate Differential Equations and Dynamics.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 216, 256 or 286, or 316. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis is a course oriented to the solutions and applications of differential equations. Numerical methods and computer graphics are incorporated to varying degrees depending on the instructor. There are relatively few proofs. Some background in linear algebra is strongly recommended. First-order equations, second and higher-order linear equations, Wronskians, variation of parameters, mechanical vibrations, power series solutions, regular singular points, Laplace transform methods, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, nonlinear autonomous systems, critical points, stability, qualitative behavior, application to competing-species and predator-prey models, numerical methods. MATH 454 is a natural sequel.\n\nMATH 412. Introduction to Modern Algebra.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215, 255, or 285; and 217. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 512. Students with credit for MATH 312 should take MATH 512 rather than 412. One credit granted to those who have completed MATH 312.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis course is designed to serve as an introduction to the methods and concepts of abstract mathematics. A typical student entering this course has substantial experience in using complex mathematical (calculus) calculations to solve physical or geometrical problems, but is unused to analyzing carefully the content of definitions or the logical flow of ideas which underlie and justify these calculations. Although the topics discussed here are quite distinct from those of calculus, an important goal of the course is to introduce the student to this type of analysis. Much of the reading, homework exercises, and exams consists of theorems (propositions, lemmas, etc.) and their proofs. MATH 217 or equivalent required as background. The initial topics include ones common to every branch of mathematics: sets, functions (mappings), relations, and the common number systems (integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers). These are then applied to the study of particular types of mathematical structures such as groups, rings, and fields. These structures are presented as abstractions from many examples such as the common number systems together with the operations of addition or multiplication, permutations of finite and infinite sets with function composition, sets of motions of geometric figures, and polynomials. Notions such as generator, subgroup, direct product, isomorphism, and homomorphism are defined and studied.\n\nMATH 312 is a somewhat less abstract course which substitutes material on finite automata and other topics for some of the material on rings and fields of MATH 412. MATH 512 is an Honors version of MATH 412 which treats more material in a deeper way. A student who successfully completes this course will be prepared to take a number of other courses in abstract mathematics: MATH 416, 451, 475, 575, 481, 513, and 582. All of these courses will extend and deepen the student's grasp of modern abstract mathematics.\n\nMATH 416. Theory of Algorithms.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 312 or 412 or EECS 203, and EECS 281. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nMany common problems from mathematics and computer science may be solved by applying one or more algorithms — well-defined procedures that accept input data specifying a particular instance of the problem and produce a solution. Students entering MATH 416 typically have encountered some of these problems and their algorithmic solutions in a programming course. The goal here is to develop the mathematical tools necessary to analyze such algorithms with respect to their efficiency (running time) and correctness. Different instructors will put varying degrees of emphasis on mathematical proofs and computer implementation of these ideas. Typical problems considered are: sorting, searching, matrix multiplication, graph problems (flows, travelling salesman), and primality and pseudo-primality testing (in connection with coding questions). Algorithm types such as divide-and-conquer, backtracking, greedy, and dynamic programming are analyzed using mathematical tools such as generating functions, recurrence relations, induction and recursion, graphs and trees, and permutations. The course often includes a section on abstract complexity theory including NP completeness. This course has substantial overlap with EECS 586 — more or less depending on the instructors. In general, MATH 416 will put more emphasis on the analysis aspect in contrast to design of algorithms. MATH 516 (given infrequently) and EECS 574 and 575 (Theoretical Computer Science I and II) include some topics which follow those of this course.\n\nMATH 417. Matrix Algebra I.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Three courses MATH 513.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nMany problems in science, engineering, and mathematics are best formulated in terms of matrices — rectangular arrays of numbers. This course is an introduction to the properties of and operations on matrices with a wide variety of applications. The main emphasis is on concepts and problem-solving, but students are responsible for some of the underlying theory. Diversity rather than depth of applications is stressed. This course is not intended for mathematics concentrators, who should elect MATH 217 or 513 (Honors). Topics include matrix operations, echelon form, general solutions of systems of linear equations, vector spaces and subspaces, linear independence and bases, linear transformations, determinants, orthogonality, characteristic polynomials, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and similarity theory. Applications include linear networks, least squares method (regression), discrete Markov processes, linear programming, and differential equations.\n\nMATH 419 is an enriched version of MATH 417 with a somewhat more theoretical emphasis. MATH 217 (despite its lower number) is also a more theoretical course which covers much of the material of MATH 417 at a deeper level. MATH 513 is an Honors version of this course, which is also taken by some mathematics graduate students. MATH 420 is the natural sequel, but this course serves as prerequisite to several courses: MATH 452, 462, 561, and 571.\n\nMATH 419. Linear Spaces and Matrix Theory.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Four terms of college mathematics in MATH 513.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nMATH 419 covers much of the same ground as MATH 417 but presents the material in a somewhat more abstract way in terms of vector spaces and linear transformations instead of matrices. There is a mix of proofs, calculations, and applications with the emphasis depending somewhat on the instructor. A previous proof-oriented course is helpful but by no means necessary. Basic notions of vector spaces and linear transformations: spanning, linear independence, bases, dimension, matrix representation of linear transformations; determinants; eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Jordan canonical form, inner-product spaces; unitary, self-adjoint, and orthogonal operators and matrices, and applications to differential and difference equations.\n\nMATH 417 is less rigorous and theoretical and more oriented to applications. MATH 217 is similar to MATH 419 but slightly more proof-oriented. MATH 513 is much more abstract and sophisticated. Math 420 is the natural sequel, but this course serves as prerequisite to several courses: MATH 452, 462, 561, and 571.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nThis course is an introduction to the mathematical models used in finance and economics with particular emphasis on models for pricing derivative instruments such as options and futures. The goal is to understand how the models reflect observed market features, and to provide the necessary mathematical tools for their analysis and implementation. The course will introduce the stochastic processes used for modeling particular financial instruments. However, the students are expected to have a solid background in basic probability theory.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nThis course explores the concepts underlying the theory of interest and then applies them to concrete problems. The course also includes applications of spreadsheet software. The course is a prerequisite to advanced actuarial courses. It also helps students prepare for the Part 4A examination of the Casualty Actuarial Society and the Course 140 examination of the Society of Actuaries. The course covers compound interest (growth) theory and its application to valuation of monetary deposits, annuities, and bonds. Problems are approached both analytically (using algebra) and geometrically (using pictorial representations). Techniques are applied to real-life situations: bank accounts, bond prices, etc. The text is used as a guide because it is prescribed for the Society of Actuaries exam; the material covered will depend somewhat on the instructor. MATH 424 is required for students concentrating in actuarial mathematics; others may take MATH 147, which deals with the same techniques but with less emphasis on continuous growth situations. MATH 520 applies the concepts of MATH 424 together with probability theory to the valuation of life contingencies (death benefits and pensions).\n\nMATH 425 / STATS 425. Introduction to Probability.\n\nInstructor(s):\nMathematics faculty 425 / STATS 425. Introduction to Probability.\n\nSection 001.\n\nInstructor(s): Math 116 and 215. Topics include the basic results and methods of both discrete and continuous probability theory: conditional probability, independent events, random variables, jointly distributed random variables, expectations, variances, covariances. Different instructors will vary the emphasis. Math 525 is a similar course for students with stronger mathematical background and ability. Stat 426 is a natural sequel for students interested in statistics. Math 523 includes many applications of probability theory.Instructor(s):\nKausch 427 / HB 603. Retirement Plans and Other Employee Benefit Plans.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Junior standing. (3). (Excl). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nAn overview of the range of employee benefit plans, the considerations (actuarial and others) which influence plan design and implementation practices, and the role of actuaries and other benefit plan professionals and their relation to decision makers in management and unions. Particular attention will be given to government programs which provide the framework, and establish requirements, for privately operated benefit plans. Relevant mathematical techniques will be reviewed, but are not the exclusive focus of the course. MATH 521 and/or MATH 522 (which can be taken independently of each other) provide more in-depth examination of the actuarial techniques used in employee benefit plans. No textbook\n\nMATH 429. Internship.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: Concentration in Mathematics. (1). (Excl). (EXPERIENTIAL). May be elected up to three times for credit. Internship credit is not retroactive and must be prearranged. May not apply toward a Mathematics concentration. May be used to satisfy the Curriculum Practical Training (CPT) required of foreign students. Offered mandatory credit/no credit.\n\nCredits: (1).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nCredits is granted for a full-time internship of at least eight weeks that is used to enrich a student's academic experience and/or allows the student to explore careers related to his/her academic studies.\n\nThis course is a study of the axiomatic foundations of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. Concepts and proofs are emphasized; students must be able to follow as well as construct clear logical arguments. For most students this is an introduction to proofs. A subsidiary goal is the development of enrichment and problem materials suitable for secondary geometry classes. Topics selected depend heavily on the instructor but may include classification of isometries of the Euclidean plane; similarities; rosette, frieze, and wallpaper symmetry groups; tessellations; triangle groups; and finite, hyperbolic, and taxicab non-Euclidean geometries. Alternative geometry courses at this level are MATH 432 and 433. Although it is not strictly a prerequisite, MATH 431 is good preparation for MATH 531.\n\nMATH 433. Introduction to Differential Geometry.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215 (or 255 or 285), and 217. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis course is about the analysis of curves and surfaces in 2- and 3-space using the tools of calculus and linear algebra. There will be many examples discussed, including some which arise in engineering and physics applications. Emphasis will be placed on developing intuitions and learning to use calculations to verify and prove theorems. Students need a good background in multivariable calculus (MATH 215) and linear algebra (preferably MATH 217). Some exposure to differential equations (MATH 216 or 316) is helpful but not absolutely necessary. Topics covered include (1) curves: curvature, torsion, rigid motions, existence and uniqueness theorems; (2) global properties of curves: rotation index, global index theorem, convex curves, 4-vertex theorem; and (3) local theory of surfaces: local parameters, metric coefficients, curves on surfaces, geodesic and normal curvature, second fundamental form, Christoffel symbols, Gaussian and mean curvature, minimal surfaces, and classification of minimal surfaces of revolution. MATH 537 is a substantially more advanced course which requires a strong background in topology (MATH 590), linear algebra (MATH 513), and advanced multivariable calculus (MATH 551). It treats some of the same material from a more abstract and topological perspective and introduces more general notions of curvature and covariant derivative for spaces of any dimension. MATH 635 and MATH 636 (Topics in Differential Geometry) further study Riemannian manifolds and their topological and analytic properties. Physics courses in general relativity and gauge theory will use some of the material of this course.\n\nMATH 450. Advanced Mathematics for Engineers I.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 215, 255, or 285. (4). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 354 or 454.\n\nCredits: (4).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submittedMATH 451. Advanced Calculus I.\n\nInstructor(s): extends 451. Advanced Calculus I.\n\nSection 001.\n\nInstructor(s):\nPeter L Duren extends 454. Boundary Value Problems for Partial Differential Equations.\n\nSection 001.MATH 454. Boundary Value Problems for Partial Differential Equations.\n\nSection 002.\n\nInstructor(s):This course will concentrate on the applications of ordinary differential\nequations to physiological systems. Partial differential equations will\nnot be covered in detail. Thus, a course in ODEs such as 216 or 316 will\nbe sufficient preparation for this course.\n\nWho could take the course? Basically anybody who is interested\nin applying mathematical methods to the biological sciences. For instance, students from Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Complex Systems, Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering, Mathematics, Chemical Engineering, Physiology, Microbiology, and Epidemiology.\n\nWhat kind of background will you need? Basically a course in differential\nequations, such as 216 or 316. If you have never seen a differential equation\nbefore, you may have trouble with the course. You will also need to be familiar\nand comfortable with computers, as a lot of the work in the course will\nhave to be done on a computer. You will not need to be an expert in biology, as we will learn most of what we need to know as we go.\n\nMATH 471. Introduction to Numerical Methods.\n\nSection 001.\n\nInstructor(s):Credits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted 471. Introduction to Numerical Methods.\n\nSection 002. 481. Introduction to Mathematical Logic.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 412 or 451 or equivalent experience with abstract mathematics. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nAll of modern mathematics involves logical relationships among mathematical concepts. In this course we focus on these relationships themselves rather than the ideas they relate. Inevitably this leads to a study of the (formal) languages suitable for expressing mathematical ideas. The explicit goal of the course is the study of propositional and first-order logic; the implicit goal is an improved understanding of the logical structure of mathematics. Students should have some previous experience with abstract mathematics and proofs, both because the course is largely concerned with theorems and proofs and because the formal logical concepts will be much more meaningful to a student who has already encountered these concepts informally. No previous course in logic is prerequisite. In the first third of the course the notion of a formal language is introduced and propositional connectives (and, or, not, implies), tautologies, and tautological consequence are studied. The heart of the course is the study of first-order predicate languages and their models. The new elements here are quantifiers ('there exists' and 'for all'). The study of the notions of truth, logical consequence, and provability lead to the completeness and compactness theorems. The final topics include some applications of these theorems, usually including non-standard analysis. MATH 681, the graduate introductory logic course, also has no specific logic prerequisite but does presuppose a much higher general level of mathematical sophistication. PHIL 414 may cover much of the same material with a less mathematical orientation. MATH 481 is not explicitly prerequisite for any later course, but the ideas developed have application to every branch of mathematics.\n\nMATH 485. Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers and Supervisors.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: One year of high school algebra. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in MATH 385. May not be included in a concentration plan in mathematics.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submittedThis is an elective course for elementary teaching certificate\ncandidates that extends and deepens the coverage of mathematics begun in the\nrequired two-course sequence MATH 385-489. Topics are chosen from geometry and\nalgebra.\n\nMATH 501. Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics Student Seminar.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: At least two 300 or above level math courses, and graduate standing; Qualified undergraduates with permission of instructor only. (1). (Excl). (BS). May be repeated for credit for a maximum of 6 credits. Offered mandatory credit/no credit.\n\nCredits: (1).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThe Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics (AIM) student seminar is an introductory and survey course in the methods and applications of modern mathematics in the natural, social, and engineering sciences. Students will attend the weekly AIM Research Seminar where topics of current interest are presented by active researchers (both from U-M and from elsewhere). The other central aspect of the course will be a seminar to prepare students with appropriate introductory background material. The seminar will also focus on effective communication methods for interdisciplinary research. MATH 501 is primarily intended for graduate students in the Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics M.S. and Ph.D. programs. It is also intended for mathematically curious graduate students from other areas. Qualified undergraduates are welcome to elect the course with the instructor's permission.\n\nStudent attendance and participation at all seminar sessions is required. Students will develop and make a short presentation on some aspect of applied and interdisciplinary mathematics.\n\nMATH 513. Introduction to Linear Algebra.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 412. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. Two credits granted to those who have completed MATH 214, 217, 417, or 419.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis is an introduction to the theory of abstract vector spaces and linear transformations. The emphasis is on concepts and proofs with some calculations to illustrate the theory. For students with only the minimal prerequisite, this is a demanding course; at least one additional proof-oriented course e.g., MATH 451 or 512) is recommended. Topics are selected from: vector spaces over arbitrary fields (including finite fields); linear transformations, bases, and matrices; eigenvalues and eigenvectors; applications to linear and linear differential equations; bilinear and quadratic forms; spectral theorem; Jordan Canonical Form. MATH 419 covers much of the same material using the same text, but there is more stress on computation and applications. MATH 217 is similarly proof-oriented but significantly less demanding than MATH 513. MATH 417 is much less abstract and more concerned with applications. The natural sequel to MATH 513 is MATH 593. MATH 513 is also prerequisite to several other courses (MATH 537, 551, 571, and 575) and may always be substituted for MATH 417 or 419.\n\nStudent Body: a mix of math and computer science undergrads and non-math majors\n\nBackground and Goals: This is an introduction to the theory of abstract vector spaces and linear\ntransformations. The emphasis is on concepts and proofs with some calculations to illustrate the theory.\n\nAlternatives: MATH 419 (Lin. Spaces and Matrix Thy) covers much of the same material using the same text, but there is more stress on computation and applications. MATH 217 (Linear Algebra) is similarly\nproof-oriented but significantly less demanding than MATH 513. MATH 417 (Matrix Algebra I) is much less\nabstract and more concerned with applications.\n\nSubsequent Courses: The natural sequel to MATH 513 is MATH 593 (Algebra I). MATH 513 is also prerequisite\nto several other courses: MATH 537, 551, 571, and 575, and may always be substituted for MATH 417 or\n419.\n\nMATH 520. Life Contingencies I.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 424 and 425. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThe goal of this course is to teach the basic actuarial theory of mathematical models for financial uncertainties, mainly the time of death. In addition to actuarial students, this course is appropriate for anyone interested in mathematical modeling outside of the physical sciences. Concepts and calculation are emphasized over proof. The main topics are the development of (1) probability distributions for the future lifetime random variable, (2) probabilistic methods for financial payments depending on death or survival, and (3) mathematical models of actuarial reserving. MATH 523 is a complementary course covering the application of stochastic process models. MATH 520 is prerequisite to all succeeding actuarial courses. MATH 521 extends the single decrement and single life ideas of 520 to multi-decrement and multiple-life applications directly related to life insurance and pensions. The sequence MATH 520-521 covers the Part 4A examination of the Casualty Actuarial Society and covers the syllabus of the Course 150 examination of the Society of Actuaries. MATH 522 applies the models of MATH 520 to funding concepts of retirement benefits such as social insurance, private pensions, retiree medical costs, etc.\n\nMATH 523. Risk Theory.\n\nInstructor(s):\n\nRisk management is of major concern to all financial institutions and is an active area of modern finance. This course is relevant for students with interests in finance, risk management, or insurance and provides background for the professional examinations in Risk Theory offered by the Society of Actuaries and the Casualty Actuary Society. Students should have a basic knowledge of common probability distributions (Poisson, exponential, gamma, binomial, etc.) and have at least junior standing. Two major problems will be considered: (1) modeling of payouts of a financial intermediary when the amount and timing vary stochastically over time; and (2) modeling of the ongoing solvency of a financial intermediary subject to stochastically varying capital flow. These topics will be treated historically beginning with classical approaches and proceeding to more dynamic models. Connections with ordinary and partial differential equations will be emphasized. Classical approaches to risk including the insurance principle and the risk-reward tradeoff. Review of probability. Bachelier and Lundberg models of investment and loss aggregation. Fallacy of time diversification and its generalizations. Geometric Brownian motion and the compound Poisson process. Modeling of individual losses which arise in a loss aggregation process. Distributions for modeling size loss, statistical techniques for fitting data, and credibility. Economic rationale for insurance, problems of adverse selection and moral hazard, and utility theory. The three most significant results of modern finance: the Markowitz portfolio selection model, the capital asset pricing model of Sharpe, Lintner and Moissin, and (time permitting) the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n\nMATH 525 / STATS 525. Probability Theory.\n\nSection 001.\n\nInstructor(s):\nCharles R Doering\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 451 (strongly recommended) or 450. MATH 425 would be helpful. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis course is a thorough and fairly rigorous study of the mathematical theory of probability. There is substantial overlap with MATH 425, but here more sophisticated mathematical tools are used and there is greater emphasis on proofs of major results. MATH 451 is preferable to MATH 450 as preparation, but either is acceptable. Topics include the basic results and methods of both discrete and continuous probability theory. Different instructors will vary the emphasis between these two theories. EECS 501 also covers some of the same material at a lower level of mathematical rigor. MATH 425 is a course for students with substantially weaker background and ability. MATH 526, STATS 426, and the sequence STATS 510-511 are natural sequels.\n\nBackground and Goals: This course in intended for students with a strong background in topology, linear algebra, and multivariable advanced calculus equivalent to the courses MATH 513 and MATH 590. Its goal is to introduce the basic concepts and results of differential topology and differential geometry.\nContent: Manifolds, vector fields and flows, differential forms, Stokes' theorem, Lie group basics, Riemannian metrics, Levi-Civita connection, geodesics\nAlternatives: MATH 433 (Intro to Differential Geometry) is an undergraduate version which covers less material in a less sophisticated way.\nSubsequent Courses: MATH 635 (Differential Geometry)\n\nThis course is an introduction to the theory of complex valued functions of a complex variable with substantial attention to applications in science and engineering. Concepts, calculations, and the ability to apply principles to physical problems are emphasized over proofs, but arguments are rigorous. The prerequisite of a course in advanced calculus is essential. Differentiation and integration of complex valued functions of a complex variable, series, mappings, residues, and applications. Evaluation of improper real integrals and fluid dynamics. MATH 596 covers all of the theoretical material of MATH 555 and usually more at a higher level and with emphasis on proofs rather than applications. MATH 555 is prerequisite to many advanced courses in science and engineering fields.\n\nMATH 556. Methods of Applied Mathematics I.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 217, 419, or 513; 451 and 555. (3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit.\n\nCredits: (3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nThis is an introduction to analytical methods for initial value problems and boundary value problems. This course should be useful\nto students in mathematics, physics, and engineering. We will begin with systems of ordinary differential equations. Next, we will\nstudy Fourier Series, Sturm-Liouville problems, and eigenfunction expansions. We will then move on to the Fourier Transform, Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma, inversion formula, the uncertainty principle and the sampling theorem. Next we will cover distributions, weak convergence, Fourier transforms of tempered distributions, weak solution of differential equations and Green's functions. We\nwill study these topics within the context of the heat equation, wave equation, Schrödinger's equation, and Laplace's equation.\n\nThe syllabus will describe this more thoroughly, but this course is designed primarily for students in math, computer science, and related fields.\nThe first half of the course is on graph theory and some complexity theory, while the second half deals with some major topics from algebraic and geometric\ncombinatorics: partially ordered sets, simplicial complexes as they arise in combinatorics, and matroids. In the course of examining these topics, we also will briefly discuss and use a few of the major techniques from enumerative combinatorics, namely bijective proofs, generating functions and inclusion-exclusion via\nMöbius functions. The second half of the course will not follow the textbook quite as closely as the first half.\n\nMATH 575. Introduction to Theory of Numbers I.\n\nSection 001 — [3 credits].\n\nInstructor(s):\nKannan Soundararajan\n\nPrerequisites & Distribution: MATH 451 and 513. (1, 3). (Excl). (BS). May not be repeated for credit. Students with credit for MATH 475 can elect MATH 575 for 1 credit.\n\nCredits: (1, 3).\n\nCourse Homepage: No homepage submitted.\n\nMany of the results of algebra and analysis were invented to solve problems in number theory. This field has long been admired for its beauty and elegance and recently has turned out to be extremely applicable to coding problems. This course is a survey of the basic techniques and results of elementary number theory. Students should have significant experience in writing proofs at the level of MATH 451 and should have a basic understanding of groups, rings, and fields, at least at the level of MATH 412 and preferably MATH 512. Proofs are emphasized, but they are often pleasantly short. A computational laboratory (MATH 476, 1 credit) will usually be offered as a supplement to this course. Standard topics which are usually covered include the Euclidean algorithm, primes and unique factorization, congruences, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Diophantine equations, primitive roots, quadratic reciprocity and quadratic fields, application of these ideas to the solution of classical problems such as Fermat's last 'theorem'. Other topics will depend on the instructor and may include continued fractions, p-adic numbers, elliptic curves, Diophantine approximation, fast multiplication and factorization, Public Key Cryptography, and transcendence. MATH 475 is a non-Honors version of MATH 575 which puts much more emphasis on computation and less on proof. Only the standard topics above are covered, the pace is slower, and the exercises are easier. All of the advanced number theory courses (MATH 675, 676, 677, 678, and 679) presuppose the material of MATH 575. Each of these is devoted to a special subarea of number theory.\n\nMATH 590. Introduction to Topology.\n\nSection 001.\n\nInstructor(s):\nArthur G Wasserman\n\nBackground and Goals: Math 590 is an introduction to point set topology. It is quite theoretical and requires extensive construction of proofs.\nContent: Topological and metric spaces, continuous functions, homeomorphism, compactness and connectedness, covering spaces and other topics.\nText: Topology, Second Edition, by Munkres, Prentice Hall\nThe course will cover (most of) chapters 2 through 6 of the text.\nGrades will be based on weekly individual homework assignments, class participation, two tests and the final exam.\n\nMATH 591. General and Differential Topology.\n\nSection 001.\n\nPrerequisites: Math 451 or the equivalent is a prerequisite. In addition, we will assume a knowledge of Chapter 1 of Munkres' book. Students may wish to go over this chapter before the course.\nThis course will be a introduction to general topology and differential topology. We will spend roughly half of the semester on each of these topics.\nMath 591 is the first part of a two-semester sequence in topology, the sequel being Math 592. The course will be a preparation for part of the topology QR exams. Students who already have a good background in general and differential topology should consider taking Math 537 instead.\nWe'll cover:\nTopological Spaces and Continuous Functions\nQuotient Topologies\nConnectedness and Local Connectedness\nCompactness and Local Compactness\nCountability and Separation Axioms\nUrysohn's Lemma\nTychonoff's Theorem\nComplete Metric Spaces\nManifolds and Smooth Maps\nDerivatives and Tangents\nImmersions and Submersions\nTransversality\nHomework assignments will be given periodically. There will also be a midterm exam and a final exam.\nText :\nTopology, a First Course by James Munkres, Prentice-Hall and Differential Topology by Victor Guillemin and Alan Pollack, Prentice-Hall.\nWe will cover roughly Chapters 2-4 of Munkres' book, parts of Chapters 5 and 7, and Chapter 1 of Guillemin and Pollack.","id":"/853","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9635176658630371,"__label__0":0.03650230914354324}}

{"text":"About Me\n\nWednesday, August 31, 2011\n\nMost math text books have examples that are completely worked out with the solution given. Take a piece of paper and hide the textbook answer and work, but show the question. Redo the problem and then check your work with their work and solution.\n\n2. Study for Tests and Quizzes.\n\nIt is easy to just do the review homework and feel like you are ready for the test. You need to do this and more. Study for the test or quiz by going back through problems that have been given and solved in class. Actually redo them and check your work. Studying for math is DOING the MATH.\n\n3. Make sure your homework is correct.\n\nCheck your answers with those that are in the back of the book while you are doing your assignment.\n\n4. Do math EVERYDAY.\n\nDo your homework every day. Try not to skip any days of homework. If you are cramming all your work into a short single session you will find this usually ends up in frustration as well as poor long term memory with the topic.\n\n5. Attempt the most difficult questions.\n\nThe most difficult questions will usually teach you the most about the material. Never skip them. Try to get the most exposure to these problems as you can. Try to solve them on your own. Revisit them. Go in for help. Ask a question on the problems in class.\n\n6. Take a break.\n\nGive yourself a break when working with math. If you are being efficient, then three fifteen minute sessions in a day are better than one 45 minute session. Stand up. Stretch. Go for a walk. Move your work to a new place. A break is needed when working with math.\n\n7. Have a good attitude.\n\nNever think \"I'm terrible at math\". You usually meet your own expectations. Believe that you can do it!\n\n8. Go in for help with your teacher and bring a specific question.\n\nWhen you bring in a specific question to your math teacher they can help you with where you are struggling. The teacher then can typically give you more examples that are similar to what you are struggling with.\n\n9. 5 minutes.\n\nOnce your homework is done, then take an extra 5 minutes to look at these possible things: vocabulary, formulas, notes, projects, and book examples.\n\nWednesday, August 24, 2011\n\nYesterday I made a math problem so that it took up one whole page of typing paper. I cut it up into 6 equal pieces that were approximately 3 by 3 inches. I put it a random order and put a paper clip on it. I did this for 5 problems in all and 2 sets of each for a total of 10 questions. I have 20 students in my class. So I had my students work in pairs. It is real easy to cut these problems up with a paper cutter. See the above cut out lines that I took with the problem.\n\nThen I put the 5 stations with 2 sets of the same problem around the room. Four people, or two pairs of partners would be at each station. I would then have them start on the problem and set the timer for ONE MINUTE. The partners together would have to unscramble the pieces and then solve the problem. They would write their answer down on their paper. Once they were done, they could check the answer that is provided at each station. After the minute was over and students had checked their answers, I told them to rotate. They went to the next station and we did the process all over again.\n\nI was happy with the outcome because they seemed to enjoy trying to figure out the puzzle and do the math. It also helps the students to MOVE and LEARN. They are moving after each problem.","id":"/871","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9731174111366272,"__label__0":0.026902668178081512}}
{"text":"Algebra: A Complete Course\n\nby VideoText Interactive\n\nIs VideoText a Pre-Algebra course, an Algebra 1 course, an Algebra 2 course, or all of these courses?\n\nThe reason that we named our program \"Algebra: A Complete Course,\" is that we believe the best way to learn Algebra is to start at the beginning and end at the end! In this program you will find a complete study of the essential material covered in a traditional Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 course.\n\nHowever, we need to continue a little further with this answer because Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 are terms that refer mostly to the traditional way that Algebra has been taught. Traditional Algebra 1 classes attempt to cover most of Algebra in the first year, but the methods that are used, and the speed with which the material is covered, hinders student understanding of the material. Instead, the student is just exposed to memorizing rules, formulas, tricks, and shortcuts. By the time they get to what is called an Algebra 2 course, (sometimes after they take a Geometry course), they have forgotten almost all of the Algebra that they memorized. So, that Algebra 2 course (which is by definition, a rehash of whatever has been called \"Algebra 1\"), must repeat practically all of the Algebra 1 course. In fact, it usually repeats a lot of the Pre-Algebra material as well. This is usually referred to as the \"spiral method\" of learning, and it is not very effective in helping students to excel, especially at this level of mathematics.\n\nWe think that this huge overlap is generally unproductive, and largely unnecessary if the concepts are taught analytically. Therefore we call our program \"Algebra: A Complete Course,\" because we employ a mastery-learning approach, sometimes moving at a slower pace, but without the overlap. As a result, students often complete the course even more quickly.\n\nVideoText's Algebra: A Complete Course program contains 176 video lessons contained in 10 unit directories. The program covers Pre-Algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II, and is a firm foundation for students advancing to VideoText's Geometry: A Complete Course, covering Geometry and Trigonometry.\n\nMaterials in the complete course include:\n\n176 Video Lessons - Each of the 5-10 minute lessons explore Algebra concepts in a detailed logical order. Because no shortcuts or tricks are used, the methods are easy to follow and promote clear understanding.\n\n360 pages of Course Notes - These notes allow students to review the logical development of a concept. Each page chronologically follows the video lesson, repeating exactly what was shown on the screen.\n\n590 pages of Student WorkText - These pages review the concept developed in each lesson. More examples are given and exercises are provided for students. The explanations are virtually free of complicated language, making it easy for students to follow the logic of each concept.\n\nSolutions Manuals - These manuals provide detailed, step-by-step solutions for every problem in the student WorkText. This resource is a powerful tool when used by students to complete an error-analysis of their work, and to check their thought processes.\n\nProgress Tests - These tests, with the answer keys included, are designed to have students demonstrate understanding, lesson-by-lesson, and unit-by-unit. There are two versions of each test, allowing for retesting or review, to make sure students have mastered concepts.\n\nThe quality of mathematics is extremely important to me, as math and science go hand-in-hand. There are many students who cannot handle my chemistry course, for example, because they have not had a good algebra course. That is why I strongly encourage you to look at Videotext Interactive's algebra course. It is, truly, the best that I have seen.\n\nThe course teaches real mathematics. It does not use tricks or shortcuts. Instead, it teaches the student to think mathematically. That's what is missing from many algebra courses! The use of animation and graphics is excellent. They do not detract from the learning, as is the case with some video courses I have seen. Instead, they enhance the student's ability to understand what is happening in each and every step along the way.\n\nIf you want your student to really learn algebra, then you should use this course.

Some potential problems that someone with mathematical training might encounter are briefly discussed below. It may be useful to note which of them you find most intriguing, and why.\n\nHow can an airline use smarter scheduling to reduce costs of aircraft parking and engine maintenance?\n\nHow can one design a detailed plan for a clinical trial? Building such a plan requires advanced statistical skills and sophisticated knowledge of the design of experiments.\n\nIs ethanol a viable solution for the world's dependence on fossil fuels? Can biofuel production be optimized to combat negative implications on the world's economy and environment?\n\nHow can automotive systems become more efficient and reduce emissions as mandated by U.S. public policy?\n\nHow do we use major advances in computing power to incorporate knowledge about interactions between the oceans, the atmosphere and living ecosystems into models used to predict long-term change?\n\nHow can automotive and aircraft companies test performance, safety, and ergonomics, while at the same time lowering the cost of construction and testing prototypes?\n\nA pharmaceutical company wants to\nsearch a very large database of proteins to find one that is similar in shape or activity to one they have discovered. What's the most efficient way to do so?\n\nHow might disease spread in populated areas in the event of\na bioterrorism incident, and how would it be contained?\n\nHow do you design a robotic hand to grip a coin and drop it in\na slot?\n\nHow can you mathematically model the spread of a forest fire depending on weather, ground cover and type of trees?\n\nHow can you allocate an investment among various financial instruments to meet a risk/reward trade-off?\n\nSince a chemical company cannot test potential new products by releasing them into the atmosphere, it must develop models of atmospheric chemistry that simulate the complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Can computational simulations show sufficient detail to capture the effects of the chemicals, but still be fast enough to permit studies of many different chemicals?\n\nHow can genome sequencing analysis help in making clinical decisions based on a personalized medicine approach?\n\nRecommendation algorithms provide users of e-commerce systems with unique ratings and recommendations of items and products based on their past purchases, behavior and interests. How can mathematics improve rating prediction performance and help enhance the consumer experience?\n\nPart of the preparation for your future is obtaining a solid foundation in mathematical and computational knowledge—tools like differential equations, probability, combinatorics, applied algebra, and matrices, as well as the art of abstraction and advanced computing and programming skills. Preparation for a career in applied mathematics and computational science also involves being able to apply these skills to real-life problems, and achieving practical results.

The overarching goal of the program is that all students be able to reason and communicate proficiently in mathematics. CMP helps students develop an understanding of important concepts, skills, procedures, and ways of thinking and reasoning in number sense, measurement, geometry, algebra, probability and statistics. The concepts are embedded in engaging problems that students explore individually, in a small group, or with a whole class. The problems presented over time give student practice with important concepts, related skills, and algorithms. A three-phased workshop model that support s problem centered instruction is used to deliver the curriculum in these classes. Teachers have had opportunities for training in CMP2 made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, and CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning. The District Math Coaches and Lesley University will continue to provide teachers with training in the mathematical content and implementation of lessons.\n\nThe Math programs are implemented using the Workshop Model. This three-phase instructional workshop model used to deliver instruction in all math classrooms in grades K - 8. In the initial phase, Launch or Opening – the teacher sets the problem, introduces new ideas, clarifies definitions reviews, old concepts, and connects to past experiences without lowering the challenge of the task. During the second phase, Explore or Work Time – students work independently or in small groups to gather data, share ideas, look for patterns, and make conjectures. In the final phase Summary or Closing – the students present and discuss their solutions as well as the strategies they used as the teacher guides them to reach the mathematical goal of the class and connect their new understanding to prior knowledge. Teachers have had opportunities for training on the workshop model made available to them through district initiatives, America's Choice On-Grade Level Training, CMP Training from Lesley University and Pearson Learning, and Math Investigations Training from Hampshire Educational Collaborative. District Math Coaches will continue to work with teachers to enhance the implementation of the program and help to deepen the understanding and connection of the mathematical strands.\n\nCurriculum Maps for K – 8 have been designed to ensure that students are exposed to a rigorous curriculum in every school and every grade, and to have consistent instruction and assessment district wide. The district's expectation is for students to successfully meet the Massachusetts Mathematics Standards and to score at the proficient range on the MCAS test in mathematics. In order to facilitate this, teachers are required to follow the curriculum maps. The successful implementation of these maps requires teachers to work through the project and problems prior to planning their lessons. The math coaches and other district personnel were trained in curriculum mapping by America's Choice, became the principle architects of the documents, and are now providing professional development to the grade level teachers as the first of these maps are available.","id":"/885","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9128096103668213,"__label__0":0.08721040189266205}}

{"text":"Synopses & Reviews\n\nPublisher Comments:\n\nBEGINNING ALGEBRA: CONNECTING CONCEPTS THROUGH APPLICATIONS shows students how to apply traditional mathematical skills in real-world contexts. The emphasis on skill building and applications engages students as they master algebraic concepts, problem solving, and communication skills. Students learn how to solve problems generated from realistic applications, instead of learning techniques without conceptual understanding. The authors have developed several key ideas to make concepts real and vivid for students. First, they emphasize strong algebra skills. These skills support the applications and enhance student comprehension. Second, the authors integrate applications, drawing on realistic data to show students why they need to know and how to apply math. The applications help students develop the skills needed to explain the meaning of answers in the context of the application. Third, the authors develop key concepts as students progress through the course. For example, the distributive property is introduced in real numbers, covered when students are learning how to multiply a polynomial by a constant, and finally when students learn how to multiply a polynomial by a monomial. These concepts are reinforced through applications in the text. Last, the authors' approach prepares students for intermediate algebra by including an introduction to material such as functions and interval notation as well as the last chapter that covers linear and quadratic modeling.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMark Clark graduated from California State University Long Beach with a Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics in 1995. He is a full-time Associate Professor at Palomar College and has taught there for the past 9 years. He is a member of AMATYC and regularly attends the national AMATYC and ICTCM conferences. He has also done extensive reviewing and testing of various classroom technologies and materials. Through this work, he is committed to teaching his students through applications and using technology to help his students both understand the mathematics in context and communicate their results clearly.

{"text":"MATH 240\n\nUsing a calculator\n\nSolving a system of linear equations on a computer or calculator\nis surprisingly difficult.\nInverting a matrix or performing certain other matrix operations\ncan lead to numerical errors that require a lot of theory to understand.\nOur department has an entire undergraduate course,\nMath 434, Numerical Linear Algebra,\nthat covers numerical techniques in linear algebra.\nWe do not have enough time to discuss numerical algorithms in MATH 240,\nand if you do not know the relevant theory,\nyou must be very cautious and skeptical about the answer\nwhen you just press a button on your calculator.\n\nSolving a system of equations\n\nIf you have been trained to believe that\na calculator will always give you the correct answer,\nyou may be in for a shock\nif you try to solve a system of equations\nby just plugging the coefficients into your calculator and pressing a button.\nEven a system of two equations in two unknowns\ncan present problems for the program used by your calculator.\nHere is one example.\n\nWe will try to solve this system of equations.\n\n416785x + 415872y = 1\n415872x + 414961y = 0\n\nThe coefficients in the problem have six significant digits.\nSince the TI-85 calculator stores more than twice that many\nsignificant digits internally,\nsolving the system would seem to present no problem.\nUsing the equation solver on the TI-85 gives the following \"answer\".\n\nYou can \"check\" the calculator answer by substituting it\nback into the system.\nBe sure to use the values stored in the calculator.\nThen, to the limits of the calculator's accuracy,\neverything checks out,\nand, in fact, both solutions appear to be correct.\n\nTo find the exact solution,\nwe can use elementary row operations on the system of equations.\nThe first goal is to reduce the size of the numbers,\nbut retain integer values.\nHere are the results.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to the TI-85.\nUsing MATLAB on a SUN workstation also gives\nan answer that differs substantially from the correct one.\nThe difficulties are inherent in the problem.\nTo look at this problem from the geometric point of view,\nwe could compute the slope of each line.\nTo 12 decimal point accuracy, we get\n\n416785 ÷ 415872 = -1.00219538704\n415872 ÷ 414961 = -1.00219538704\n\nTo most calculators, the lines appear to be parallel,\nand so there should be no solution at all!\nBecause the angle between the two lines is very small,\na small change in the coefficients caused by roundoff error\ncan make a very large difference in the solution.\nFrom a geometric point of view,\nshifting the two lines just a little bit\ncan make a bit difference in the point of intersection.\n\nInverting a matrix\n\nIn the previous problem,\nwe were able to find an exact inverse for the coefficient matrix.\n\nTo illustrate some of the inherent difficulties\nin doing Gaussian elimination using floating point arithmetic,\nwe will look at the row reduction of a standard \"badly behaved\" matrix.\n\nThe matrix given below is called a Hilbert matrix.\nIt is a well-known example of a matrix that causes problems\nfor numerical algorithms.\nTo help understand the problems,\nwe will do an exact row reduction,\ncompared to a row reduction done using floating point arithmetic.\nTo see how the error in the approximations can be compounded,\nwe will use a highly simplified example,\nin which the floating point arithmetic\nis carried out with accuracy to only three significant digits.\n\nIn the original matrix, labeled (1),\nsome of the decimal entries are already inaccurate.\nIn matrix (3), the three digit computation that produces the\n3rd entry in row 4 is this:\n\n.837×10-1 - (.904)(.830×10-1)\n= .837×10-1 - .750×10-1\n= .870×10-2\n\nComparing this to the correct value of\n1 ÷ 120 = .00833 (to 3 digits)\nshows that it has only one correct digit.\n\nIn matrix (5), the last entry of row 4 is computed as follows:\n\n.837×10-2 - (.690)(.127×10-1)\n= .837×10-2 - .876×10-2\n= .006×10-2\n\nBecause we have to subtract two values that are nearly equal,\nthe answer has even less accuracy.\nThe cumulative errors in reducing just 3 rows\nproduce a value of -.0000600 instead of\n(-1) ÷ 4200 = -.000238 (to 3 digits).\n\nThe method for defining a Hilbert matrix can be extended to larger sizes,\nand the 10 by 10 Hilbert matrix presents substantial problems\nfor even a very sophisticated numerical algorithm.\nYou can experiment on your calculator,\nby inverting the Hilbert matrices of larger and larger sizes.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nYves Nievergelt,\nNumerical Linear Algebra on the HP-28 or How to Lie With Supercalculators,\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly, (1991), 539-544","id":"/901","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9986228942871094,"__label__0":0.0013971326407045126}}

{"text":"Tutorial 1\n\nOnce you have access to an installation of Mathematica, you need to know how to\nuse it.\n\nOpening the Program\n\nIn an on-campus computer lab, go to Start Menu, then Programs, then Wolfram Mathematica. Click\non the icon for Mathematica, named Spikey.\n\nUp will pop an introductory window. On the left hand side of this button is an option to create a new Mathematica notebook or open an old one. The\nnotebook is where all your interactions with the program will take place.\n\nFirst steps with Mathematica\n\nOpen the file. The file should look like a \"Powerpoint\" Presentation. If it does not, go to the Format Menu and click on \"Format > Screen Environment > SlideShow\".\n\nFollow this tutorial step-by-step and discuss the most interesting aspects\nwith your neighbors.\n\nAt the end of the tutorial, you should use the remaining time to explore the power of Mathematica. I suggest looking in the Documentation Center (Help Menu) or at the Wolfram Demonstrations Project. Feel free to explore on your own or with your neighbors. If you are having trouble getting started, here is what I do when I am exploring:\n\nI go to the Documentation Center and type in a command (such as Manipulate)\n\nI do a quick look at the selected examples that are given and see if they are interesting.\n\nIf so, I want to see all the examples. So I select the entire notebook (Ctrl-A or Apple-A) and then open all subgroups (Cell Menu: \"Grouping > Open All Subgroups\").\n\nI play around with the examples, moving sliders, changing variables to see what happens.\n\nIf I see a command I do not know, I will search for it in the Documentation Center\n\nAt the bottom of the file is a \"See Also\" section, which tells you similar commands.\n\nAlso at the bottom are links to more in depth tutorials, which can be useful sometimes.\n\nOther Items of Note!\n\nIn Mathematica, it is important to distinguish between parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}:\n\nParentheses (): Used to group mathematical expressions, such as (3+4)/(5+7).\n\nBrackets []: Used when calling functions, such as N[Pi].\n\nBraces {}: Used when making lists, such as {i,1,20}.\n\nIf you use the wrong symbols in the wrong places or if you do not have a closing symbol for every opening symbol, Mathematica will\ngive you an error.\n\nMathematica is Case-SenSitive (AA is not the same as aA), so\nbe careful about what you type.\nMany of your initial errors will come about because of one of the two above problems.\n\nIn Mathematica, there are four types of equals: =, :=, ==, and\n===. You need to understand the difference between the first two.\n\nTo define a variable to store it in memory, use =. For example, to define z to be 3, write\nz=3.\n\nYou use == to check for equality. For example, 1-1==0 will\nevaluate to True and 1==0 will evaluate to False.\n\nYou use := to define your own command. (This is advanced.)\n\nYou will likely not use === in this class.\n\nOne of the most important things to do is explore. If you are having trouble with a certain function, use the\n? command to ask for help. Enter ? Table and the output will be a yellow box\nwith a quick synopsis of the command. For more detailed information, click the blue >> at the bottom\nright of this yellow box. This will open the Documentation Center\nwhich gives examples of using the\ncommand in action, available options for this command,\nand anything else you might want to know about the command.\n\nAlgebra and Calculus\n\nMathematica will do everything your calculator can and more.\n\nUse ^ to put something to a power.\n\npi is Pi, e is E and sqrt(-1) is I.\n\nIf you want to see the numerical approximation to a fraction or irrational number, use the function N. For example, to find the decimal represenation of pi, write N[Pi].\n\nUse E^x or Exp[x] to represent the function ex.\n\nTo take the derivative of a function, use D and specify the derivative with respect to which\nvariable. For instance D[x^2 + 3x, x].\n\nTo take the integral of a function, use Integrate and specify the integral with respect to\nwhich variable. For instance Integrate[x^2 + 3x, x].\n\nTo solve for the roots of ax2+bx+c=0 symbolically, use Solve[a x^2 + b x + c == 0, x].\nNotice the double equals sign. (Mathematica is searching for when the expression is True.)\n\nCoefficient[(1 + x)^10, x^3] gives the coefficient of x3 in the expansion\nof (1 + x)10.","id":"/915","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9957221746444702,"__label__0":0.004297889303416014}}

{"text":"Because of its large command structure and intricate syntax, Mathematica can be difficult to learn. Wolfram's Mathematica manual, while certainly comprehensive, is so large and complex that when trying to learn the software from scratch - or find answers to specific questions - one can be quickly overwhelmed.\nA Beginner's Guide to Mathematica offers a simple, step-by-step approach to help math-savvy newcomers build the skills needed to use the software in practice. Concise and easy to use, this book teaches by example and points out potential pitfalls along the way. The presentation starts with simple problems and discusses multiple solution paths, ranging from basic to elegant, to gradually introduce the Mathematica toolkit. More challenging and eventually cutting-edge problems follow. The authors place high value on notebook and file system organization, cross-platform capabilities, and data reading and writing. The text features an array of error messages you will likely encounter and clearly describes how to deal with those situations.\nWhile it is by no means exhaustive, this book offers a non-threatening introduction to Mathematica that will teach you the aspects needed for many practical applications, get you started on performing specific, relatively simple tasks, and enable you to build on this experience and move on to more real-world problems.\n\n\"This book is a comprehensive package for knowledge sharing on Mathematics. The language of the book is simple and self-explanatory, this will help the students to grasp the fundamentals of the subject easily. The book follows a to the point approach and lays stress on the understanding of the core concepts. Appropriate number of MCQs are given for each topic that are of great help to the students appearing for competitive and State Board examinations.\"\"\n\n \" . . . [a] treasure house of material for students and teachers alike . . . can be dipped into regularly for inspiration and ideas. It deserves to become a classic.\" --London Times Higher Education Supplement \"The author succeeds in his goal of serving the needs of the undergraduate population who want to see mathematics in action, and the mathematics used is extensive and provoking.\" --SIAM Review \"Each chapter discusses a wealth of examples ranging from old standards . . . to novelty . . . each model is developed critically, analyzed critically, and assessed critically.\" --Mathematical Reviews A Concrete Approach to Mathematical Modelling provides in-depth and systematic coverage of the art and science of mathematical modelling. Dr. Mesterton-Gibbons shows how the modelling process works and includes fascinating examples from virtually every realm of human, machine, natural, and cosmic activity. Various models are found throughout the book, including how to determine how fast cars drive through a tunnel, how many workers industry should employ, the length of a supermarket checkout line, and more. With detailed explanations, exercises, and examples demonstrating real-life applications in diverse fields, this book is the ultimate guide for students and professionals in the social sciences, life sciences, engineering, statistics, economics, politics, business and management sciences, and every other discipline in which mathematical modelling plays a role.\n\nMost texts on nonparametric techniques concentrate on location and linear-linear (correlation) tests, with less emphasis on dispersion effects and linear-quadratic tests. Tests for higher moment effects are virtually ignored. Using a fresh approach, A Contingency Table Approach to Nonparametric Testing unifies and extends the popular, standard tests by linking them to tests based on models for data that can be presented in contingency tables.\nThis approach unifies popular nonparametric statistical inference and makes the traditional, most commonly performed nonparametric analyses much more complete and informative. It also makes tied data easily handled, and almost exact Monte Carlo p-values can be obtained. With data in contingency tables, one can then calculate a Pearson-type, chi-squared statistic and its components. For univariate data, the initial tests based on these components detect mean differences between treatments. For bivariate data, they detect correlations. This approach leads to tests that detect variance, skewness, and higher moment differences between treatments with univariate data, and higher bivariate moment differences with bivariate data.\nAlthough the methods advanced in this book have their genesis in traditional nonparametrics, incorporating the power of modern computers makes the approach more complete and more valid than previously possible. The authors' unified treatment and readable style make the subject easy to follow and the techniques easily implemented, whether you are a fledgling or a seasoned researcher.\n\nThe first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and Maple™, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study. Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields. for time series model building. The authors begin with basic concepts in univariate time series, providing an up-to-date presentation of ARIMA models, including the Kalman filter, outlier analysis, automatic methods for building ARIMA models, and signal extraction. They then move on to advanced topics, focusing on heteroscedastic models, nonlinear time series models, Bayesian time series analysis, nonparametric time series analysis, and neural networks. Multivariate time series coverage includes presentations on vector ARMA models, cointegration, and multivariate linear systems. Special features include: Contributions from eleven of the world??'s leading figures in time series Shared balance between theory and application Exercise series sets Many real data examples Consistent style and clear, common notation in all contributions 60 helpful graphs and tables Requiring no previous knowledge of the subject, A Course in Time Series Analysis is an important reference and a highly useful resource for researchers and practitioners in statistics, economics, business, engineering, and environmental analysis. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley editorial department.\n\nDeveloped from the authors, combined total of 50 years undergraduate and graduate teaching experience, this book presents the finite element method formulated as a general-purpose numerical procedure for solving engineering problems governed by partial differential equations. Focusing on the formulation and application of the finite element method through the integration of finite element theory, code development, and software application, the book is both introductory and self-contained, as well as being a hands-on experience for any student. This authoritative text on Finite Elements: Adopts a generic approach to the subject, and is not application specific In conjunction with a web-based chapter, it integrates code development, theory, and application in one book Provides an accompanying Web site that includes ABAQUS Student Edition, Matlab data and programs, and instructor resources Contains a comprehensive set of homework problems at the end of each chapter Produces a practical, meaningful course for both lecturers, planning a finite element module, and for students using the text in private study. Accompanied by a book companion website housing supplementary material that can be found at  A First Course in Finite Elements is the ideal practical introductory course for junior and senior undergraduate students from a variety of science and engineering disciplines. The accompanying advanced topics at the end of each chapter also make it suitable for courses at graduate level, as well as for practitioners who need to attain or refresh their knowledge of finite elements through private study.\n\nAlthough the use of fuzzy control methods has grown nearly to the level of classical control, the true understanding of fuzzy control lags seriously behind. Moreover, most engineers are well versed in either traditional control or in fuzzy control-rarely both. Each has applications for which it is better suited, but without a good understanding of both, engineers cannot make a sound determination of which technique to use for a given situation.\nA First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control is designed to build the foundation needed to make those decisions. It begins with an introduction to standard control theory, then makes a smooth transition to complex problems that require innovative fuzzy, neural, and fuzzy-neural techniques. For each method, the authors clearly answer the questions: What is this new control method? Why is it needed? How is it implemented? Real-world examples, exercises, and ideas for student projects reinforce the concepts presented.\nDeveloped from lecture notes for a highly successful course titled The Fundamentals of Soft Computing, the text is written in the same reader-friendly style as the authors' popular A First Course in Fuzzy Logic text. A First Course in Fuzzy and Neural Control requires only a basic background in mathematics and engineering and does not overwhelm students with unnecessary material but serves to motivate them toward more advanced studies.\n\nThe field of applied probability has changed profoundly in the past twenty years. The development of computational methods has greatly contributed to a better understanding of the theory. A First Course in Stochastic Models provides a self-contained introduction to the theory and applications of stochastic models. Emphasis is placed on establishing the theoretical foundations of the subject, thereby providing a framework in which the applications can be understood. Without this solid basis in theory no applications can be solved.Provides an introduction to the use of stochastic models through an integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.Incorporates recent developments in computational probability.Includes a wide range of examples that illustrate the models and make the methods of solution clear.Features an abundance of motivating exercises that help the student learn how to apply the theory.Accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of probability.A First Course in Stochastic Models is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students from computer science, engineering, statistics, operations resear ch, and any other discipline where stochastic modelling takes place. It stands out amongst other textbooks on the subject because of its integrated presentation of theory, algorithms and applications.\n\nRealizing the specific needs of first-year graduate students, this reference allows readers to grasp and master fundamental concepts in abstract algebra-establishing a clear understanding of basic linear algebra and number, group, and commutative ring theory and progressing to sophisticated discussions on Galois and Sylow theory, the structure of abelian groups, the Jordan canonical form, and linear transformations and their matrix representations.\n\nR is dynamic, to say the least. More precisely, it is organic, with new functionality and add-on packages appearing constantly. And because of its open-source nature and free availability, R is quickly becoming the software of choice for statistical analysis in a variety of fields.\nDoing for R what Everitt's other Handbooks have done for S-PLUS, STATA, SPSS, and SAS, A Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R presents straightforward, self-contained descriptions of how to perform a variety of statistical analyses in the R environment. From simple inference to recursive partitioning and cluster analysis, eminent experts Everitt and Hothorn lead you methodically through the steps, commands, and interpretation of the results, addressing theory and statistical background only when useful or necessary. They begin with an introduction to R, discussing the syntax, general operators, and basic data manipulation while summarizing the most important features. Numerous figures highlight R's strong graphical capabilities and exercises at the end of each chapter reinforce the techniques and concepts presented. All data sets and code used in the book are available as a downloadable package from CRAN, the R online archive.\nA Handbook of Statistical Analyses Using R is the perfect guide for newcomers as well as seasoned users of R who want concrete, step-by-step guidance on how to use the software easily and effectively for nearly any statistical analysis.\n\nWILEY-INTERSCIENCE PAPERBACK SERIESFrom the Reviews of History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750\"This is a marvelous book . . . Anyone with the slightest interest in the history of statistics, or in understanding how modern ideas have developed, will find this an invaluable resource.\"--Short Book Reviews of ISI\n\nBecause of its portability and platform-independence, Java is the ideal computer programming language to use when working on graph algorithms and other mathematical programming problems. Collecting some of the most popular graph algorithms and optimization procedures, A Java Library of Graph Algorithms and Optimization provides the source code for a library of Java programs that can be used to solve problems in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Self-contained and largely independent, each topic starts with a problem description and an outline of the solution procedure, followed by its parameter list specification, source code, and a test example that illustrates the usage of the code.\nThe book begins with a chapter on random graph generation that examines bipartite, regular, connected, Hamilton, and isomorphic graphs as well as spanning, labeled, and unlabeled rooted trees. It then discusses connectivity procedures, followed by a paths and cycles chapter that contains the Chinese postman and traveling salesman problems, Euler and Hamilton cycles, and shortest paths. The author proceeds to describe two test procedures involving planarity and graph isomorphism. Subsequent chapters deal with graph coloring, graph matching, network flow, and packing and covering, including the assignment, bottleneck assignment, quadratic assignment, multiple knapsack, set covering, and set partitioning problems. The final chapters explore linear, integer, and quadratic programming. The appendices provide references that offer further details of the algorithms and include the definitions of many graph theory terms used in the book.","id":"/922","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9434678554534912,"__label__0":0.056552235037088394}}

{"text":"Transforming? There is a step before applying the technique of \"completing the square\" that is required and that is to come up with the technique of completing the square in the first place. You're not suggesting that the purpose of a course in elementary algebra is to just teach a finite set of techniques to be memorized, understood and used when appropriate, are you? Although I agree that is a subset of the purpose of an algebra class, that still leaves a lot of gaps in between those (finite number of) techniques taught in an algebra class and the only way to fill those gaps is that the student also develop the skill to invent new solutions without prior art. And some techniques, even though they are labeled \"techniques\" are not algorithmic or formulaic at all, such as substitution of variables or induction. Most students are poor with these because they are just a very high level form and the student must fill in the form with a solution.

Math is often about making connections as so many concepts are interrelated, be sure to record the connections you make. Areas where you have concerns or believe to be your greatest weakness are also the areas you should emphasize. To emphasize, you may wish to use a highligher and attach a few stickies. Personally, I prefer to date my notes as well, sometimes I include the text pages for handy reference.\n\nFormat\n\nI've already mentioned that it is helpful to keep audio notes, however, it is difficult to record examples of exercises in audio. Audio is better when you are reviewing postulates, procedures and formulas. The more you hear the explanations, the greater the chance you will retain the information. However, you may also wish to record your notes on your computer. I have used Microsoft One Note previously and found it quite effective. There is an add-in that allows you to perform calculations and to plot graphs and it contains an extensive collection of mathematical symbols and structures to display expressions and has a pretty good equation gallery. Two others I use are La-Tex, and Math Symbols. Although I like La Tex, it isn't my first choice for taking notes. Math Symbols is great for creating exercises and it allows you to create your equations quickly (newer version has handwriting recognition) but you'll still need another application to integrate it with. A lot of my students prefer One Note because it's where they keep all of their notes. However, everyone is different and you'll need a strategy that works best for you.\n\nTips for Improving Your Note Taking Skills\n\nListen carefully to your instructor and jot down the key points about solving problems, proving theorems or using a procedure. Write down everything you think that will help you when you return to this concept later.\n\nDon't get too wordy, keep your notes to the point and simple to understand.\n\nUse logical organization, jumping around from concept to concept will only be confusing. Make sure your examples have key points in your notes.\n\nExplain your reasoning. This component is key, keep it short and sweet but explain the logic behind the application or procedure.\n\nRecord alternate methods, as I mentioned earlier, there is usually more than one way to solve a problem, be sure to record the alternative methods.\n\nWhen taking notes in math, look at your textbook. What do you like about it? What don't you like about it? Think of your notes as a set of cheat notes for you to review. Make them look like a text that you find easy to follow.\n\nIn summary, most important of all is to review your notes in a timely way. Make review part of your routine. We are all guilty of cramming before tests and exams but a little review along the way will better equip you to see greater success in math. If journaling works better for you, you may wish to check out some strategies for effective math journaling.","id":"/933","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9745897054672241,"__label__0":0.025430353358387947}}
{"text":"The School is composed by five set of lectures, designed to introduce young researchers to the more recent advances on geometric and algebraic approaches for integer programming. Each set of lectures will be about six hours long. They will provide the background, introduce the theme, describe the state-of-the-art, and suggest practical exercises. The organizers will try to provide a relaxed atmosphere with enough time for discussion.\n\nInteger programming is a field of optimization with recognized scientific and economical relevance. The usual approach to solve integer programming problems is to use linear programming within a branch-and-bound or branch-and-cut framework, using whenever possible polyhedral results about the set of feasible solutions. Alternative algebraic and geometric approaches have recently emerged that show great promise. In particular, polynomial algorithms for solving integer programs in fixed dimension have recently been developed. This is a hot topic of international research, and the School will be an opportunity to bring up-to-date knowledge to young researchers.","id":"/935","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9709746241569519,"__label__0":0.02904544211924076}}

Currently I'm studying computer science, and I'm interested in looking into statistical and optimization applications, as well as theory (yeah, I know that sound broad, but I'm quite early in my education!). Anyways, I want to get deep into the math behind these things - statistics, combinatorics, linear and integer programming, maybe some analysis. Algebra also interests me.</p>\n<p>I've found that math studies go okay, but from time to time I have trouble. Understanding delta-epsilon proofs was a big obstacle for calculus back in high school, and more recently generating functions have been giving me serious trouble.</p>\n<p>If I pursue a path towards graduate level studies, what sort of things should I watch out for? More generally, since I don't know where I'm going, what concepts did you find hardest to grasp during your undergrad/early graduate studies?</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n by Wlog for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forWlog2009-10-25T17:37:06Z2009-10-25T17:37:06Z<p>I have advice, but it is dependent on the size of your university and/or the mathematics department therein.</p>\n<p>A large part of my undergraduate process was to tutor others in the class. A good test of your understanding is if you assist someone else in coming to the same understanding. Unfortunately, it may be that your class sizes are <em>epsilon</em>. Thus it will be more difficult to form a study group. Applied Functional Analysis is a topic of great importance for a young computer scientist, especially one who is aspiring for a PhD, but it can be slow to grasp if you are taking it as an independent reading course.</p>\n by Scott Morrison for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forScott Morrison2009-10-25T18:34:40Z2009-10-25T18:34:40Z<p>One general advice about early maths education is to not decide what you like too early!</p>\n<p>Keep learning new fields, keep reading books about things you don't know yet. Most mathematicians I know aren't working on problems they would have expected when they arrived in grad school. It takes a surprisingly long time for most people to reach the level of mathematical maturity where they're reading to work on new problems, and until you have an inkling that you're ready for this, don't overspecialise. There's plenty of time for that later!</p>\n by Elisha Peterson for \"Plateaus\" to watch out forElisha Peterson2009-10-27T23:14:33Z2009-10-27T23:14:33Z<p>My gut response is to say there are a limitless supply of these plateaus. There is so much out there that even the best mathematicians are limited in what they can understand well. So in terms of specific concept plateaus, well if you're like most of us you'll probably have lots of them, and that's a good thing.</p>\n<p>In terms of concepts, I think what I found tough was often much clearer after I lost an early misconception. E.g. for a long time I thought the Killing form in Lie algebra was using \"killing\" as a synonym for \"erasing\"... I tried to build my understanding around that conception and it didn't work very well (Killing is a name). A lot of \"simple\" mathematical ideas are known by proper names rather than descriptive terms, so as more of these accumulate you have to rely more on memorization than intuition.</p>\n<p>Outside of concepts, here's what I found tough:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transition from coursework to research.</strong> Some people are very good at getting the A when the material is put in front of them, and most textbooks are good at giving you the necessary tools to solve the problems they present. I found the transition to more open-ended problems a significant challenge.</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding the frontier of a field.</strong> As stated in a previous response, it's tough to get to the frontier of a field. It takes a lot of work, and a lot of time.

{"text":"Mathematics\n\n\"For the things of this world cannot be made known without a knowledge of mathematics. \" – Roger Bacon, philosopher\n\nBacon also said that, \"mathematics is the gate and key to the sciences.\" At St. George's, we believe the coalescence of math and science is necessary to create highly adept, numerically and scientifically literate students. An intentional and well-planned mathematics and science curriculum prepares St. George's students for an evolving and global world as well as for advanced study in college.\n\nAn integrated approach to the curriculum and its emphasis on technology seeks to combine mathematical concepts with concrete matters that are addressed in other areas of academic disciplines. High standards with regard to skill development and conceptual understanding are reinforced through project-based learning that encourages students to apply ideas in real-life settings. Through such integration the mathematical concepts being learned in the specific math classes are reinforced and enriched Students in Math 6—Honors delve deeper into topics than students in Math 6 through examining more applications and critical thinking exercises at a much faster pace The final trimester consists of students reading, analyzing, and writing about classic short stories, while honing their reading comprehension skills. Note: Same as course appearing in English section.\n\nPre-Algebra 7 prepares students for Algebra I and Geometry slope and y-intercept to graphs and linear expressions. In Pre-Algebra 7, visualization continues with consistent modeling of fractions, percents, mathematical operations, equations, probabilities, and algebraic expressions.\n\nHonors Pre-Algebra prepares students for Algebra I and Geometry at a faster pace and in more depth rate of change, slope, and y-intercept to graphs and linear expressions. In Honors Pre-Algebra, visualization continues with consistent modeling of fractions, percents, mathematical operations, equations, probabilities, and algebraic expressions.\n\nIn Accelerated Algebra I, students begin learning how to use graphing calculators.\n\nIn Honors Honors Algebra I, students begin learning how to use graphing calculators. Students in Honors Algebra I delve deeper and cover topics more rapidly than students in Accelerated Algebra I Additionally, students are introduced to right triangle trigonometry and their applications in the real world. Honors students should expect a rapid pace and more in-depth coverage.\n\nAlgebra II focuses on the study of functions, their graphs, and their properties. Specific functions covered include linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic. However, Algebra II also touches on a wide variety of other topics including, but not limited to, solving higher order equations and inequalities, conics, and polynomial and rational expressions. Students develop a clear understanding of the relationship between algebraic equations and their graphs. All work revolves around the process of solving a problem and the mathematical concepts rather than just \"getting the answer.\" Problem solving through both traditional algebraic methods and graphical methods is an important component of the class.\n\nWhile Algebra II Honors is a continuation of the concepts learned in Algebra I, this course will introduce the student to some of the theory behind those concepts. Honors Algebra II emphasizes the strong and integral relationship between functions and their graphs. Students will solve problems both algebraically and graphically using pencil and paper as well as a graphing calculator. Students will be asked to think beyond calculations and contemplate the roots and the derivations of the topics. Honors Algebra II is a preparatory course for PreCalculus, Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry, Statistics, and Calculus. To that end, this course covers a variety of topics such as linear and nonlinear functions, relations and systems; exponents and logarithms; conics; rational functions; radical functions. Problem solving strategies as well as how concepts are applied will be emphasized throughout the course.\n\nThis course is designed to strengthen students' understanding of concepts taught in Algebra II. Students will focus on a deeper study of functions—analyzing equations, graphs and real-world applications—and the introduction of trigonometry topics needed in advanced mathematics courses. Students will collaborate to construct and share knowledge, building their confidence in mathematics and preparing them for courses in high school and College Algebra or Precalculus at the college level.\n\nThis is a functions-based course that both reinforces and broadens concepts taught in Algebra II, and introduces new concepts, preparing students for calculus matrices, series & sequence, analytic geometry and introductory calculus.\n\nThis is a functions-based course that both reinforces and broadens concepts taught in Algebra II, and introduces new concepts, preparing the students for AP Calculus BC series & sequence, limits and derivatives. Students should expect more independent work and a faster-paced experience.\n\nThis course is divided into three sections, calculus, discrete topics, and statistics. Students will experience the concepts of derivatives and integration through applications in calculus. Discrete mathematics is an umbrella of mathematical topics. Topics include game theory and social theory, which use math to discuss human behavior and its effects. The third component, statistics, will be learned as a tool used in decision making. Students will learn to gather, analyze, interpret and report their findings in a systematic and mathematical manner.\n\nAP Statistics is an introductory, non-calculus based college statistics course that emphasizes understanding and analyzing statistical studies. Students will explore the theory of probability, descriptions of statistical measurements, probability distributions, experimental design and statistical inference. Students will be analyzing samples and understanding populations on an ongoing basis. Graphing calculators are used throughout the course. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.\n\nAP Calculus AB is a college-level calculus course that is generally equivalent to a first semester college course: differentiation and integration of polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions. Calculators and computers are used to increase and strengthen the students' understanding of the concepts. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.\n\nAP Calculus BC is a college-level calculus course that is generally equivalent to the first two semesters of the college Calculus sequence all of the Calculus AB topics as well as additional topics, such as series and polar coordinates. Calculators and computers are used to increase and strengthen the students' understanding of the concepts. All students enrolled in this course must take the AP exam in May.","id":"/946","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9673058390617371,"__label__0":0.032714132219552994}}

The policies ended in 2002.\n\nBased on interviews with staff who delivered these programs in colleges and institutes during the late 1990s, the authors describe the \"best practices\" for programs designed to help people with low income improve their educational credentials.\n\nThey found that effective programs address the key areas of access, retention, and transition. Other key components include identification of the existence of multiple obstacles to accessing formal education; outreach activities and strong links with community and relevant government agencies; assessment of students' needs and capabilities; financial help with tuition, fees, books, housing, and child care; and support for academic success, including counselling, advocacy, networking, and partnerships with employers.\n\nThe authors call on the British Columbia government to change welfare rules so that people receiving income assistance can participate in postsecondary education; restore and increase designated funding to post-secondary institutions to support IA recipients; support colleges and institutes in providing programs and services that offer holistic support to students; and restore tuition-free adult basic education in British Columbia's public post-secondary institutions.\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nPhased-in retirement is really a catch phrase that can include special assignments, mentoring, job sharing, and end to shift work, reduced hours and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the tax, pension and paperwork implications of these accommodations pose barriers that can translate into inertia.\n\nIn New Brunswick it was the nurses' union that brought phased-in retirement to the bargaining table. Having spent so many years fighting for improved pensions, unions are cautious about sending mixed signals to employers. As our Viewpoints survey found, however, the strongest support for phased-in retirement does in fact come from public sector unions, (48% citing this option as very important in meeting the skill shortage challenge, Viewpoints 2002).\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nGeorge and John talked about language and empowerment - giving consumers the information they need to run their lives effectively and safely.

Or see how the calculator is programmed and write their own programs. The easier the calculator is to use, the more chance they will use it (the calculator is FREE).\n- How can I change it to make it better (all areas).

I have been programming and setting up calculators (different makes and models) so I miss the concepts or areas that you don't understand because many I take for granted. Mostly using TI calculators and programming in Basic, But many free ones are able to achieve the same results and this is one of the better FREE ones and is easy to program and use (also is better than some expensive ones).

At this stage it's like BASIC with some buttons around.\nTo make really quick improvements, alter it's syntax:\n1. To automatically PRINT raw expressions (i.e. \"2+2\" line should print \"4\")\n2. To automatically ASK for unknown variables (i.e. \"2*X+5\" should ask with popup for X value and then print the result).\n\nIn general, you should do this as web service for people to calculate online and share common library of macroses.\n\nCheck top of page 'Related Articles' \"Download Precise Calculator\". There you should see many Macros that you can 'copy and paste' to the calculator and run. Then add to your stored Macros.

{"text":"Mathematics\n\nTo be well informed adults and to have access to desirable jobs, our students require a mathematics education that goes beyond what was needed by students in the past. All students must develop, deepen, and sharpen their skills, their understanding of mathematical concepts and processes, their abilities in problem-solving, reasoning, and communication abilities and hone their ability to make sense of and to solve compelling and complex problems. In order for this to occur, rigorous mathematical content must be organized, taught, and assessed in a problem-solving environment. Students' mathematical knowledge must be connected to the ideas and skills found in all grade levels, as well as to real life situations outside the classroom.\n\nOur goal is to equip each of our students with the ability and preparation to meet the mathematical demands presented by college and careers, and to carry their mathematical thinking and problem-solving into multiple learning situations.\n\nConceptual Understanding: Making sense of mathematics\n\nStudents who understand a concept can:\n• identify examples and non-examples\n• describe concepts with words, symbols, drawings, tables or models\n• provide a definition of a concept\n• use the concept in different ways\nExpectations for conceptual understanding ask students to demonstrate, describe, represent, connect, and justify.\n\nProcedural Proficiency: Skills, facts, and procedures\n\nStudents who demonstrate procedural proficiency can:\n• quickly recall basic facts (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division)\n• use standard algorithms – step-by-step mathematical procedures – to produce a correct solution or answer (might also include multiple algorithms)\n• use generalized procedures (such as the steps involved in solving an algebraic equation)\n• demonstrate fluency with procedures:\no perform the procedure immediately and accurately\no know when to use a particular procedure in a problem or situation\no use the procedure as a tool that can be applied reflexively, and doesn't distract from the task at hand (procedure is stored in long-term memory)\n\nProblem-solving and Processes: reasoning and thinking to apply mathematical content\n\nStudents must be able to:\n• reason\n• solve problems\n• communicate theirunderstanding in effective ways\n• solve increasingly complex problems from grade to grade\n• use increasingly sophisticated language and symbols to communicate their understanding, from grade to grade\n\nStudents may substitute a state-approved option for Algebra II, but should check with colleges regarding admission requirements.\n\nPreCalculus\n\nRecommended for College & Career Preparation\n\n12\n\nPreCalculus, AP Statistics, or IB Mathematics\n\nAP Calculus AB, AP Statistics, or IB Mathematics\n\n*A small number of students – generally those in the APP program at the elementary level - will participate in mathematics two years above grade level.

{"text":"Synopsis:Stuck On Algebra is a classroom-proven interactive Algebra workstation that keeps students on task doing traditional Algebra in a classic gaming model combining an unbending standard of proficiency with the forgiving and encouraging spirit of \"failure without consequence\". The result: steady improvement and repeated small successes, the addictive formula of video games without any dilution of the Algebra experience.\n\nBackground: SOA is the second generation of a system last sold in the early 90s. More than one educator who used that system in the 90s has sought me out in recent years to ask if it were still available. SOA is available now for beta testing here.\n\nSoftware In Brief: SOA offers: step-by-step guidance and correction of basic Algebra I problems entered by the student or generated by the application; solved solutions with explanations of generated problems; unassisted exams on a hierarchy of Algebra topics.\n\nTransformations SOA transforms learning mathematics in several important ways:\n\n1. Thanks to step-by-step checking, weak arithmetic skills do not prevent the learner from succeeding with Algebra. Those skills improve as mistakes are caught. The student must work to figure out what they did wrong and correct it. Progress is slower at first, but they are working on Algebra instead of yet another tedious worksheet of arithmetic, so the learner's motivation to persevere is strong.\n\n2. Assistance available in Training Modes lets students of any ability experience the pleasure of solving Algebra puzzles and enjoy math in its own right. They may make more mistakes getting there, but that only increases the satisfaction of finally succeeding and draws them into further study.\n\n3. With SOA correcting all the work, tracking student progress, and offering first-level assistance when students get stuck, the teacher has more time to work with students individually or in small groups.\n\n4. In Mission Mode learners must meet a fixed standard of mastery by passing unassisted, \"no second chance\" challenges. Missions become available only as prerequisite missions are passed, so the independent learner has a structure they can follow. For any student, Missions draw learners into ever more high-quality practice as they attempt repeatedly to pass the unassisted challenges, encouraged by getting closer each time to succeeding.\n\nSummary The system works for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Algebra is easy but there is a lot of it and it is cumulative. Algebra requires fluent application of many easy rules, which in turn requires a substantial quantity of high-quality practice to make those rules second-nature. With SOA students get more practice with ever-present feedback and assistance.\n\nSecond, Algebra is fun for any student as long as they are given the fighting chance to solve problems on their own. SOA's instant feedback, detailed hints, and solved examples give them that chance.\n\nThird, the stigma of failure is lifted without compromising the standard of proficiency that must be met. The satisfaction of small successes and evidence of steady improvement even as they fail at exams draws learners into further practice and eventual mastery. This is precisely the addictive formula of computer gaming.","id":"/953","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9292646050453186,"__label__0":0.07075542956590652}}

Applications of the theory and even suggestions for computer algebra projects are included. This book will appeal to readers from beginners to advanced students of commutative algebra or algebraic geometry. To help beginners, the essential ideals from algebraic geometry are treated from scratch. Appendices on homological algebra, multilinear algebra and several other useful topics help to make the book relatively self- contained. Novel results and presentations are scattered throughout the text. ...show less\n\nFundemental Definitions of Dimensional Theory The Principal Ideal Theorem and Systems of Parameters Dimension and Codimension One Dimension and Hilbert-Samuel Polynomials The Dimension of Affine Elimination Theory, Generic Freeness, and the Dimension of Fibers Grobner Bases Modules of Differentials","id":"/955","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9001113772392273,"__label__0":0.09990862756967545}}
{"text":"short video tutorial deals with the concept of order of operations in mathematics problems and builds on the material covered in earlier lessons.\n\nThe narrator reviews the concept, explaining that when a problem contains some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division, the order of operations specifies that the multiplication and division components must be completed first, before carrying out the addition and subtraction work.\n\nHe then explains that when the problem contains calculations contained within brackets, the bracketed calculations must be completed first.\n\nThe tutorial introduces the mnemonic BEDMAS, which stands for Brackets, Exponents, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction, although the instructor points out that exponents will be dealt with only in higher mathematics.\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nThe order of operations specifies that the multiplication and division components of a math problem must be completed before carrying out the addition and subtraction work. It also specifies that calculations contained within brackets must be completed first.\n\nThis video tutorial reinforces that concept by providing three mathematics problems to solve. Each problem is more challenging than the one before.\n\nThe problems appear on a computer screen, with the narrator giving step-by-step instructions on how to solve themCitation\n\nShare\n\nThis report examines a set of policies and practices formerly in place in British Columbia that supported access to post-secondary education and upgrading programs for income assistance (IA) recipients, particularly those facing multiple barriers to employment and education. The policies ended in 2002.\n\nBased on interviews with staff who delivered these programs in colleges and institutes during the late 1990s, the authors describe the \"best practices\" for programs designed to help people with low income improve their educational credentials.\n\nThey found that effective programs address the key areas of access, retention, and transition. Other key components include identification of the existence of multiple obstacles to accessing formal education; outreach activities and strong links with community and relevant government agencies; assessment of students' needs and capabilities; financial help with tuition, fees, books, housing, and child care; and support for academic success, including counselling, advocacy, networking, and partnerships with employers.\n\nThe authors call on the British Columbia government to change welfare rules so that people receiving income assistance can participate in postsecondary education; restore and increase designated funding to post-secondary institutions to support IA recipients; support colleges and institutes in providing programs and services that offer holistic support to students; and restore tuition-free adult basic education in British Columbia's public post-secondary institutions.\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nPhased-in retirement is really a catch phrase that can include special assignments, mentoring, job sharing, and end to shift work, reduced hours and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the tax, pension and paperwork implications of these accommodations pose barriers that can translate into inertia.\n\nIn New Brunswick it was the nurses' union that brought phased-in retirement to the bargaining table. Having spent so many years fighting for improved pensions, unions are cautious about sending mixed signals to employers. As our Viewpoints survey found, however, the strongest support for phased-in retirement does in fact come from public sector unions, (48% citing this option as very important in meeting the skill shortage challenge, Viewpoints 2002).\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nGeorge and John talked about language and empowerment - giving consumers the information they need to run their lives effectively and safely. They gave examples of baffling communication, and explained why people use complicated language. They discussed some of the myths that surround the term \"plain language\" and showed how the techniques go beyond just crafting the words. Finally, they used case studies to illustrate the benefits of plain language - efficiency, profitability, precision, and consumer satisfaction.\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nThis is a report on the National Literacy Secretariat's \"Policy Conversation on New Technologies and Literacy.\" It provides background information about the NLS and an overview of some new technologies. It also explains the policy conversation process, which was intended to obtain information and opinions from the public about whether or not a policy on literacy and technology is needed and if it is, what some of its components might be.\n\nCitation\n\nShare\n\nThis set of practice tests is one of the resources for a 40-hour course developed to train people for jobs in water/wastewater treatment facilities.\n\nThe document includes tests for material covered in five of the eight course modules: measurement conversions; linear, area and volume calculations; chemical measurements; hydraulics; and wastewater and electricity.\n\nThere is also a sample final assessment, covering all the course material.

Marge's intense desire to educate both her students and herself has inspired the writing of numerous best-selling textbooks. Marge, who received Bachelor's and Master's degrees from California State University at Sacramento, is now affiliated with American River College. Marge is an avid reader and traveler. Her travel experiences often find their way into her books as applications, exercise sets, and feature sets. She is particularly interested in archeology. Trips to various digs and ruin sites have produced some fascinating problems for her textbooks involving such topics as the building of Mayan pyramids and the acoustics of ancient ball courts in the Yucatan.\n\nWhen John Hornsby enrolled as an undergraduate at Louisiana State University, he was uncertain whether he wanted to study mathematics education or journalism. His ultimate decision was to become a teacher, but after twenty-five years of teaching at the high school and university levels and fifteen years of writing mathematics textbooks, both of his goals have been realized. His love for both teaching and for mathematics is evident in his passion for working with students and fellow teachers as well. His specific professional interests are recreational mathematics, mathematics history, and incorporating graphing calculators into the curriculum. John's personal life is busy as he devotes time to his family (wife Gwen, and sons Chris, Jack, and Josh). He has been a rabid baseball fan all of his life. John's other hobbies include numismatics (the study of coins) and record collecting. He loves the music of the 1960s and has an extensive collection of the recorded works of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.\n\nDavid Schneider has taught mathematics at universities for over 34 years and has authored 36 books. He has an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Oberlin College and a PhD in mathematics from MIT. During most of his professional career, he was on the faculty of the University of Maryland--College Park. His hobbies include travel, dancing, bicycling, and hiking.\n\nCallie Daniels has always had a passion for learning mathematics and brings that passion into the classroom with her students. She attended the University of the Ozarks on an athletic scholarship, playing both basketball and tennis. While there, she earned a bachelor's degree in Secondary Mathematics Education as well as the NAIA Academic All-American Award. She has two master's degrees: one in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Missouri-Rolla, the second in Adult Education from the University of Missouri- St. Louis. Her hobbies include watching her sons play sports, riding horses, fishing, shooting photographs, and playing guitar. Her professional interests include improving success in the community college mathematics sequence, using technology to enhance students' understanding of mathematics, and creating materials that support classroom teaching and student understanding.","id":"/968","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.940608561038971,"__label__0":0.059411413967609406}}

{"text":"Representation Standard\nfor Grades 9–12\n\nInstructional\nprograms from prekindergarten through grade 12 should enable all students\nto—\n\ncreate and use representations to organize, record, and communicate\nmathematical ideas;\n\nselect, apply, and translate among mathematical representations\nto solve problems;\n\nuse representations to model and interpret physical, social,\nand mathematical phenomena.\n\nIf mathematics is the \"science of patterns\" (Steen 1988), representations are\nthe means by which those patterns are recorded and analyzed. As students\nbecome mathematically sophisticated, they develop an increasingly large\nrepertoire of mathematical representations and the knowledge of how to\nuse them productively. This knowledge includes choosing specific representations\nin order to gain particular insights or achieve particular ends.\n\nThe importance of representations can be seen in every section of this chapter.\nIf large or small numbers are expressed in scientific notation, their\nmagnitudes are easier to compare and they can more readily be used in\ncomputations. Representation is pervasive in algebra. Graphs convey particular\nkinds of information visually, whereas symbolic expressions may be easier\nto manipulate, analyze, and transform. Mathematical modeling requires\nrepresentations, as illustrated in the \"drug dosage\" problem and in the\n\"pipe offset\" problem. The use of matrices to represent transformations\nin the plane illustrates how geometric operations can be represented visually\nyet also be amenable to symbolic representation and manipulation in a\nway that helps students understand them. The various methods for representing\ndata sets further demonstrate the centrality of this topic.\n\np.\n360\n\nA wide variety of representations can be seen in the examples in this chapter.\nBy using various representations for the \"counting rectangles\" problem\nin the \"Problem Solving\" section, students could find different solutions\nand compare them. The use of algebraic symbolism to explain a striking\ngraphical phenomenon is central to the \"string traversing tiles\" task\nin the \"Communication\" section. Representations facilitate reasoning and\nare the tools of proof: they are used to examine statistical relationships\nand to establish the validity of a builder's shortcut. They are at the\ncore of communication and support the development of understanding in\nMarta's and Nancy's work on the \"string traversing tiles\" problem. Although\nat one level the story of Mr. Robinson's class is about connections, at\nanother level it is about representation: one group of students places\ncoordinates that \"make things eeeasy,\" the class gains insights from dynamic\nrepresentations of geometric objects, and the students produce proofs\nin coordinate and Euclidean geometry. A major lesson of that story is\nthat different representations support different ways of thinking about\nand manipulating mathematical objects. An object can be better understood\nwhen viewed through multiple lenses. »\n\nWhat should representation\nlook like in grades 9 through 12?\n\nIn grades 9–12, students' knowledge and use of representations should\nexpand in scope and complexity. As they study new content, for example,\nstudents will encounter many new representations for mathematical concepts.\nThey will need to be able to convert flexibly among these representations.\nMuch of the power of mathematics comes from being able to view and operate\non objects from different perspectives.\n\nIn elementary school, students most often use representations to reason about\nobjects and actions they can perceive directly. In the middle grades,\nstudents increasingly create and use mathematical representations for\nobjects that are not perceived directly, such as rational numbers or rates.\nBy high school, students are working with such increasingly abstract entities\nas functions, matrices, and equations. Using various representations of\nthese objects, students should be able to recognize common mathematical\nstructures across different contexts. For example, the sum of the first\nn odd natural numbers, the areas of square gardens, and the\ndistance traveled by a vehicle that starts at rest and accelerates at\na constant rate can be represented by functions of the form f(x) = ax2.\nThe fact that these situations can be represented by the same class of\nfunctions implies that they are alike in some fundamental mathematical\nway. Students are ready in high school to see similarity in the underlying\nstructure of mathematical objects that appear contextually different but\nwhose representations look quite similar.\n\np.\n361\n\nHigh school students should be able to create and interpret models of more-complex\nphenomena, drawn from a wider range of contexts, by identifying essential\nfeatures of a situation and by finding representations that capture mathematical\nrelationships among those features. They should recognize, for example,\nthat phenomena with periodic features often are best modeled by trigonometric\nfunctions and that population growth tends to be exponential, or logistic.\nThey will learn » to describe some real-world\nphenomena with iterative and recursive representations.\n\nConsider the graph of the concentration of CO2\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude during the period\nfrom 1986 through 1991 (see fig. 7.39) (Sarmiento 1993). Teachers might\nuse an example such as this to help students understand and interpret\nseveral aspects of representation. Students could discuss the trends in\nthe change in concentration of CO2 as\na function of time as well as latitude. Doing so would draw on their knowledge\nabout classes of functions and their ability to interpret three-dimensional\ngraphs. They should be able to see a roughly linear increase across time,\ncoupled with a sinusoidal fluctuation with the seasons. Focusing on the\nchange in the character of the graph as a function of latitude, students\nshould note that the amplitude of the sinusoidal function lessens from\nnorth to south. Students can test whether the trends they observe in the\ngraph correspond to recent theoretical work on CO2\nconcentration in the atmosphere. For example, the author of the article\nattributes the sinusoidal fluctuation to seasonal variations in the amount\nof photosynthesis taking place in the terrestrial biosphere. Students\ncould discuss the differences in amplitude across seasons in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres.\n\nFig. 7.39. A three-dimensional graph\nof the concentration of C02\nin the atmosphere as a function of time and latitude (Adapted\nfrom Sarmiento [1993])\n\nElectronic technologies\nprovide access to problems and methods that until recently were difficult\nto explore meaningfully in high school. In order to use the technologies\neffectively, students will need to become familiar with the representations\ncommonly used in technological settings. For example, solving equations\nor multiplying matrices using a computer algebra system calls for learning\nhow to input and interpret information in formats used by the system.\nMany software tools that students might use include special icons and\nsymbols that carry particular meaning or are needed to operate the tool;\nstudents will need to learn about these representations and distinguish\nthem from the mathematical objects they are manipulating.\n\nWhat should be the teacher's role in developing representation in grades\n9 through 12?\n\np.\n362\n\nAn important part of learning mathematics is learning to use the language, conventions,\nand representations of mathematics. Teachers should introduce students\nto conventional mathematical representations »\nand help them use those representations effectively by building\non the students' personal and idiosyncratic representations when necessary.\nIt is important for teachers to highlight ways in which different representations\nof the same objects can convey different information and to emphasize\nthe importance of selecting representations suited to the particular mathematical\ntasks at hand (Yerushalmy and Schwartz 1993; Moschkovich, Schoenfeld,\nand Arcavi 1993). For example, tables of values are often useful for quick\nreference, but they provide little information about the nature of the\nfunction represented. Consider the table in the \"Algebra\" section in this\nchapter that gives the number of minutes of daylight in Chicago every\nother day for the year 2000. The values in the table suggest that the\nfunction is initially increasing and then becomes decreasing. Knowledge\nof the context of a graph of those values suggests that the behavior is\nactually periodic. Similarly, algebraic and graphical representations\nof functions may provide different information. Some global properties\nof functions, such as asymptotic behavior or the rate of growth of a function,\nare often most readily apparent from graphs. But information about specific\naspects of a function—the exact value of f() or exact values of\nx where f(x)has a maximum or a minimum—may best\nbe determined using an algebraic representation of the function. Suppose\ng(x) is given by the equation g(x) = f(x)\n+ 1, for all x. The analytic definitions of f(x) and\ng(x) may offer the most-effective ways of computing specific\nvalues of f(x) and g(x), but graphing the function\nreveals that the \"shape\" of g(x) is precisely the same as that\nof f(x)—that the graph of g(x) is obtained by\ntranslating the graph of f(x) one unit upward.\n\nAs in all instruction, what matters is what the student sees, hears, and understands.\nOften, students interpret what teachers may consider wonderfully lucid\npresentations in ways that are very different from those their teachers\nintended (Confrey 1990; Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle 1993). Or they may\ninvent representations of content that are idiosyncratic and have personal\nmeaning but do not look at all like conventional mathematical representations\n(Confrey, 1991; Hall et al. 1989). Part of the teacher's role\nis to help students connect their personal images to more-conventional\nrepresentations. One very useful window into students' thinking is student-generated\nrepresentations. To illustrate this point, consider the following problem\n(adapted from Hughes-Hallett et al. [1994, p. 6]) that might be presented\nto a tenth-grade class:\n\nA flight from SeaTac Airport near Seattle, Washington, to LAX Airport\nin Los Angeles has to circle LAX several times before being allowed\nto land. Plot a graph of the distance of the plane from Seattle against\ntime from the moment of takeoff until landing.\n\np.\n363\n\nStudents could work individually or in pairs to produce distance-versus-time\ngraphs for this problem, and teachers could ask them to present and defend\nthose graphs to their classmates. Graphs produced by this class, or perhaps\nby students in other classes, could be handed out for careful critique\nand comment. When they perform critiques, students get a considerable\namount of practice in communicating mathematics as well as in constructing\nand improving on representations, and the teacher gets information that\ncan be helpful in assessment. One representation of the flight that a\nstudent might produce is shown in figure 7.40. »\n\nFig. 7.40. A representation that\na student might produce of an airplane's distance from\nits take-off point against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nThis representation indicates a number of interesting and not uncommon misunderstandings,\nin which literal features of the story (the plane flying at constant height\nor circling around the airport) are converted inappropriately into features\nof the graph (Dugdale 1993; Leinhardt, Zaslavsky, and Stein 1990).\nRepresentations of this type can provoke interesting classroom conversations,\nrevealing what the students really understand about graphing. This revelation\nputs the teacher in a better position to move the class toward a more nearly\naccurate representation, as sketched in figure 7.41.\n\nFig. 7.41. A more nearly accurate\nrepresentation of the airplane's distance from its take-off\npoint against the time from takeoff to landing\n\nMathematics is one of humankind's greatest cultural achievements. It is\nthe \"language of science,\" providing a means by which the world around us\ncan be represented and understood. The mathematical representations that\nhigh school students learn afford them the opportunity to understand the\npower and beauty of mathematics and equip them to use representations in\ntheir personal lives, in the workplace, and in further study.","id":"/971","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.976449728012085,"__label__0":0.023570258170366287}}
{"text":"Teaching Conic Sections\n\nTeaching Conic Sections\n\nSo I currently teach a precalc class and new this year we are required to teach conic section.\nWe cover parabolas, circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas. Since I haven't taught this before, I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on how to teach it? The book we use has a bunch of formulas, but I'm looking for a way to teach it to my students without using all the formulas so they don't have to memorize a bunch of formulas before their exam. What has worked for others?\n\nYou should be able to design good lessons directly based on the book sections. As long as you use a Pre-Calculus book you will have rich enough information available.\n\nBe sure to demonstrate the conic sections using a realistic three-dimensional model. Also use the definitions of each conic section and the distance formula to derive the equation for each conic section, and include the analytical cartesian graph for each.\n\nYou are right on-target about not just giving a bunch of formulas. The demonstration and the derivations are important for learning and understanding.\n\nTeaching Conic Sections\n\nAs a student who struggled through conic sections, I found that by exploring how they were really just variations of the of the same things cemented my understanding of the topic. So if I were in your shoes I would try to show the similarities and differences of the different sections. Specifically between the hyperbola and parabola and the circle and ellipse.\n\nAs someone who not long ago learnt Conic Sections, I found the derivations of the formula much easier than remembering them. It was good to see the formulas at first but I much preferred the derivations.\n\nAs above said, use a 3D model as well. The 2D drawing didn't really do it justice for me.\n\nI was definitely going to derive the formulas using the distance formula and talk about applications. I wouldn't scratch formulas altogether, but our book has like 8 different formulas, which isn't fair to give all of them to my students if I don't give them on an exam.\n\nSomething one of my physics professors said to our class is recalled to me by this thread. He said students of today are so used to tv games, comics, etc. rather than playing with things with their hands, that they can't visualize 3d objects anymore. He was of course exaggerating. I think it quite odd if a student can't visualize what's going on with conic sections, so yes a model would be quite good. Maybe you could get someone to cut it at all the right angles.\n\nAlso, the old books on geometry, particularly solid geometry, should be good with conic sections, so maybe go down to the library and have a look at them.\n\nAh yes, I have a fun experiment using that! You should certainly teach that!\n\nHere it goes: Dandelin was a Belgian, and some people decided to celebrate him. So what they did was the following. They made an ice-cream cone, they put a small biscuit in there (they made it like an ellipse so it would fit inside the cone). And they they put a ball of ice-cream in the cone. Then they would sell it to people.I always tought that it was very clever, and it was quite the financial succes too!did they then discover another, smaller, ice-cream (just like discovering another layer of chocolates when you finish the first layer!), which touched the other focus on the other side of the biscuit?","id":"/972","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9577248692512512,"__label__0":0.04229520261287689}}

It is an attempt to make high school\nAlgebra accessible to all students through the use of situational curriculum\nmaterials and an intelligent computer based tutoring system.\n\nThe high school tutor and course materials are now called \"Cognitive\nTutor Algebra\" and are being marketed by the PACT Center's spin-off\ncompany, Carnegie\nLearning. The PACT Center is currently developing tutors for\nMiddle School math.\n\nThe development of Algebra throughout the curriculum is based on the\nstudents' own informal knowledge of mathematics and on problem situations.\nModelling situations such as the Nintendo Problem, shown above, students\nbegin to construct intuitive understandings of and connections between\nmultiple representations of functions. From the beginning of the course\nstudents are asked to make the connections between the various representations\nand to construct each representation based on their understanding of the\nproblem situation.\n\nA mere listing of topics covered does not adequately provide the necessary\nframework for the curriculum. Consequently, we use a matrix which attempts\nto show the development of the curriculum in a more meaningful way; however,\na three dimensional framework showing the multiple representations as the\ncore which expands from the first quadrant with simple direct variation\nto mx+b to all four quadrants to systems to data analysis to quadratics\nwould probably be more appropriate.\n\nCurrently students work in their regular classrooms three days a week on\nthe curriculum. The other two class periods are spent in the computer lab\nworking on the computer tutors. (See the PAT\ntutor). The classroom curriculum is reproduced for each student on\nloose-leaf notebook paper with space for them to write their responses\non the actual workbook. ALL answers must be written in complete sentences.\nHomework is also reproduced on loose-leaf. TI-81 scientific calculators\nare provided by the school for use in the classroom. Each student can be\nissued a scientific calculator to use on homework.\n\nThe U.S. Shirts\nProblem is a sample three day lesson module from the first quarter\nof the classroom curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to read over the problem\nsituation at the beginning of the period and then give the students time\nto work in cooperative groups to solve the problem. Groups are given overlays\nto describe the problem and asked to present their results to the rest\nof the class.\n\nLearning in Cooperative Groups\n\nThe PUMP project is committed not only to providing the opportunity\nfor all students to enroll in Algebra, but also to providing the students\nwith the human and technological support to enable them to be successful\nin Algebra. This support includes the computer tutors, the support of the\nChapter One reading specialist, after school tutoring, Family Algebra Nights,\nthe inclusion of Special Education students and teachers, support for the\nteachers including summer workshops and on-going help, and new assessment\nstrategies.\n\nFamily Algebra Night\n\nStudent assessment is a major area of emphasis. The first\nsemester final exam and the year\nend final exam from the1993-94 school year are presented to the new\nstudents at the beginning of the school year along with level 4 student\nresponses in order to clearly communicate our expectations to the students.\nStudents are assessed on their performance on group tasks in the classroom,\nindividual on demand performance tasks, portfolios, and their work on the\ncomputer tutors, as well as on more the traditional homework and tests.\nAt the end of each grading period students are given an individual on-demand\nperformance task similar to the situations that they have worked on in\nthe classroom. Each of these requires the student to do a mathematical\nanalysis of a situation and to produce a writen report based on their analysis.\nAt the end of the first and third grading periods, these tasks are graded\nby the individual teachers; but at the end of each semester these tasks\nare graded using the New\nStandards Type Grading Conference Model.","id":"/981","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9605714678764343,"__label__0":0.03944862261414528}}

Crauder, Evans, Johnson, and Noell have found the answer: Help them become intelligent consumers of the quantitative data to which they are exposed every day—in the news, on TV, and on the Internet.\n\nIn an age of record credit card debt, opinion polls, and questionable statistics, too few students have mastered the basic mathematical concepts required to think about and evaluate data. Quantitative Literacy: Thinking Between the Lines develops the idea of rates of change as a key concept in helping students make good personal, financial, and political decisions.\n\nThe goal of Quantitative Literacy is a more informed generation of college students who think critically about the data provided to them, the images shown to them, the facts presented to them, and the offers made to them. Quantitative Literacy shows students the mathematics that matters to them: their bank account, their medical tests, their daily news feed. It also develops their mathematical thinking, helping them to understand the difference between truthful and misleading mathematical reporting.\n\nIt's All in the Examples…\n\nAfter taking your course and working with Quantitative Literacy, students will be equipped to think about and answer all of the following questions:\n\nWill the Atkins Diet really help me lose weight?\n\nHow do I use logic to get the best results from a Google search?\n\nIs the local carpet store trying to fool me into thinking their prices are lower because they quote price by the square foot instead of the square yard?\n\nHow far can I go on this tank of gas?\n\nHow do I interpret the results of my medical tests?\n\nHow can businesspeople and politicians use graphs and charts to mislead me?\n\nWill inflation affect my savings and the age at which I can retire?\n\nHow do I avoid getting tricked by a Ponzi scheme?\n\nI want to buy a new car in two years.

For anyone interested in circuit analysis.More than 30 years before it was made into a movie, Harriet the Spy was a groundbreaking book: its unflinchingly honest portrayal of childhood problems and emotions changed children's literature forever. Happily, neither Fitzhugh's style has dated nor her themes become obsolete, and it is still recognized as one of the finest children's novels around. The fascinating story centres around an intensely curious and intelligent girl, Harriet lovable heroine, is one of literature's most unforgettable characters. (Ages 8 to 12)Not all whites in South Africa are outright racists. Some, like Bam and Maureen Smales in Nadine Gordimer's thrilling and powerful novel July's People, are sensitive to the plights of blacks during the apartheid state. So imagine their quandary when the blacks stage a full-scale revolution that sends the Smaleses scampering into isolation. The premise of the book is expertly crafted; it speaks much about the confusing state of affairs of South Africa and serves as the backbone for a terrific adventure.

Alas, the Royal Privilege is more like a Predicament. Not only does she have to endure daily princess lessons from her critical Grandmère (\"It isn't as if I'm going to show up at the castle and start hurling olives at the ladies-in-waiting\"), but her new stepfather is also her algebra teacher, her mother is pregnant and vomiting, she doesn't like her boyfriend very much, and she's convinced the real love of her life--her best friend's older brother--thinks of her as a kid.\n\nWritten in diary form like Louise Rennison's award-winning Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging, Meg Cabot's endearing and often hilarious novel Princess in Love--third in the series after The Princess Diaries and Princess in the Spotlight--is sure to appeal to teen readers who will be able to relate to Mia--a young woman who would like people to know that \"behind this mutant facade beats the heart of a person who is striving, just like everybody else in this world, to find self-actualization.\" (Ages 12 and older) --Karin SnelsonNarnia ... where giants wreak havoc ... where evil weaves a spell ... where enchantment rules.Through dangers untold and caverns deep and dark, a noble band of friends are sent to rescue a prince held captive.

Traditional classroom students who miss classes and independent learners may have access to this project's lectures.\n\nObjective\n\nThese lesson learners are able to develop linear equations from few given points by calculating slopes and y-intercepts.\n\nProject Rationale/Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this project is to provide students who have missed classes a chance to catch up, to assist independent learners who might be in preparations of GED exams, and other online learners who wwould like to increase their math general knowledge. Additionally, this project is to support English Language Learners (ELL) who have difficulties keeping up with live lecture pace (Merryfield, 2003).\n\nWhy This project Was Put On YouTube?\n\nYouTube is an interesting media that attracts a huge number of Internet surfers. It was created in 2005; however, it had the third largest Internet traffic behind Google and Yahoo in 2009. Thefefore, it is an ideal means for distance learning (Bonk, 2009).\n\nWhy Asynchronous Communication Was Chosen?\n\nAsynchronous lectures are ideal in distance learn because they convenient for busy individuals who cannot afford to attend regular classes. In addition, they can access these lectures as many times as they like (Harism, 2000). Also asynchronous lectures are convenient for ELL because they cannot keep up with fast paced lectures, and they decode every word they hear in the lecture. At the time they complete processing the first few sentences of the lecture, the speaker may finish the speech or start talking about new materials (Merryfield, 2003). Many postsecondary and K-12 school institutions that implemented online courses and studies found that students learning online modestly perform better than students learning in classrooms (Means et al., 2010).\n\nReferences:\n\nBonk, C.

{"text":"This practical introduction to the techniques needed to produce high-quality mathematical illustrations is suitable for anyone with basic knowledge of coordinate geometry. Bill Casselman combines a completely self-contained step-by-step introduction to the graphics programming language PostScript with an analysis of the requirements of good mathematical illustrations. The many small simple graphics projects can also be used in courses in geometry, graphics, or general mathematics. Code for many of the illustrations is included, and can be downloaded from the book's web site:  scientists, engineers, and even graphic designers seeking help in creating technical illustrations need look no further.\n\nMathematical Explorations with MATLAB examines the mathematics most frequently encountered in first-year university courses. A key feature of the book is its use of MATLAB, a popular and powerful software package. The book's emphasis is on understanding and investigating the mathematics by putting the mathematical tools into practice in a wide variety of modeling situations. Even readers who have no prior experience with MATLAB will gain fluency. The book covers a wide range of material: matrices, whole numbers, complex numbers, geometry of curves and families of lines, data analysis, random numbers and simulations, and differential equations from the basic mathematics. These lessons are applied to a rich variety of investigations and modeling problems, from sequences of real numbers to cafeteria queues, from card shuffling to models of fish growth. All extras to the standard MATLAB package are supplied on the World Wide Web.\n\nThe use of software packages to solve mathematical problems is becoming increasingly popular. This comprehensive book illustrates how Mathcad can be used to solve many mathematical tasks. It also provides the mathematical background for the Mathcad package. Practical Use of Mathcadcontains many solutions to basic mathematical tasks for engineering and natural science. It can be used both as a reference and tutorial manual for lecturers and students, and as a practical manual for engineers mathematicians and computer scientists. The latest version of Mathcad V.8 Professional for Windows 95/98 is used throughout.\n\nThis unique book provides a streamlined, self-contained and modern text for a one-semester mathematical methods course with an emphasis on concepts important from the application point of view. Part I of this book follows the \"paper and pencil\" presentation of mathematical methods that emphasizes fundamental understanding and geometrical intuition. In addition to a complete list of standard subjects, it introduces important, contemporary topics like nonlinear differential equations, chaos and solitons. Part II employs the Maple software to cover the same topics as in Part I in a computer oriented approach to instruction. Using Maple liberates students from laborious tasks while helping them to concentrate entirely on concepts and on better visualizing the mathematical content. The focus of the text is on key ideas and basic technical and geometric insights presented in a way that closely reflects how physicists and engineers actually think about mathematics.","id":"/999","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9808962941169739,"__label__0":0.01912371814250946}}
