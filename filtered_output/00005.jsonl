{"text":"Computer algebra system\n\nA computer algebra system (CAS) is a software program that facilitates symbolic mathematics. The core functionality of a CAS is manipulation of mathematical expressions in symbolic form.\n\nThe expressions typically include polynomials in multiple variables; standard functions of expressions (sin, exponential, etc.); arbitrary functions of expressions; integrals, sums, and products of expressions; truncated series with expressions as coefficients, matrices of expressions, and so on.

{"text":"The skills that students are practicing in related rates problems are:\n\nDifferentiating a known equation implicitly with respect to time.\n\nInterpreting the time derivative of a quantity as a rate of change.\n\nThe main reason that related rates problems feel so contrived is that calculus books do not want to assume that the students are familiar with any of the equations of science or economics. Every related rates problem inherently involves differentiating a known equation, and the only equations that the calculus book assumes are the equations of geometry.\n\nThus, you can find related rates problems involving various area and volume formulas, related rates problems involving the Pythagorean Theorem or similar triangles, related rates problems involving triangle trigonometry, and so forth. A few of these problems are compelling -- for example, computing the speed of an airplane based on ground observations of its altitude and apparent angular velocity -- but most of them do feel a bit contrived.\n\nThe reality, of course, is that students are familiar with many of the basic equations and concepts of science and economics, and there's no rule against using these in problems. For example, you can make up all sorts of compelling related rates problems by starting with any physics or chemistry equation and imagining a situation where you might want to take its derivative:\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If the object is accelerating at a rate of $9.8 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$, how fast is the kinetic energy increasing when the speed is $30 \\;\\text{m}/\\text{s}$?\n\nAn ideal gas satisfies $PV = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R \\approx 8.314\\;\\; \\text{J}\\; \\text{mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$. Give the rate at which the temperature and volume of the gas are increasing, and then ask about the rate of change in pressure when the volume and temperature reach certain amounts.\n\nThe total energy stored in a capacitor is $\\frac{1}{2} Q^2 / C$, where $Q$ is the amount of charge stored in the capacitor and $C$ is the capacitance. Give the value of $C$ and the rate at which $Q$ is decreasing, and ask about the rate at which the capacitor is losing energy when the energy is a certain amount.\n\nIn astronomy, the absolute magnitude $M$ of a star is related to its luminosity $L$ by the formula\n$$\nM \\;=\\; M_{\\text{sun}} -\\; 2.5\\; \\log_{10}(L/L_{\\text{sun}}).\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\text{sun}} = 4.75$ and $L_{\\text{sun}} = 3.839 \\times 10^{26} \\text{watts}$. (Note that, by convention, brighter stars have lower magnitude.) If the absolute magnitude of a variable star is decreasing at a rate of $0.09 / \\text{week}$, how quickly is the luminosity of the star increasing when the magnitude is $3.8$?\n\nIt's easy to make these up: just think of any equation in science or economics whose derivative might be interesting.

Vectors with the same number of elements can be\nadded and subtracted in a very natural way:\n\nExample 1\n\nThe difference between the vector x=111x=111 and the\nvector y=001y=001 is the vector z=x-y=110z=x-y=110. These vectors are illustrated in Figure 2. You can see that this result is consistent with the definition of\nvector subtraction in Equation 3. You can also picture the subtraction in\nFigure 2 by mentally reversing the direction of vector yy to get -y-y and then\nadding it to xx by sliding it to the position where its tail coincides with the\nhead of vector xx. (The head is the end with the arrow.) When you slide a\nvector to a new position for adding to another vector, you must not change\nits length or direction.\n\nFigure 2: Subtraction of Vectors\n\nExercise 1\n\nCompute and plot x+yx+y and x-yx-y for each of the following\ncases:\n\nx=132,y=123x=132,y=123 ;\n\nx=-13-2,y=123x=-13-2,y=123 ;\n\nx=1-32,y=132x=1-32,y=132.\n\nScalar Product. Several different kinds of vector multiplication are\ndefined.2 We begin with the scalar product. Scalar multiplication is defined\nfor scalar aa and vector xx as\n\nax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.ax=ax1ax2ax3|axn.\n\n(4)\n\nIf |a|<1|a|<1, then the vector axax is \"shorter\" than the vector x; if |a|>1|a|>1, then the\nvector axax is '\"longer\" than x. This is illustrated for a 2-vector in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: The Scalar Product axax\n\nExercise 2\n\nCompute and plot the scalar product axax when x=11/2l/4x=11/2l/4 for\neach of the following scalars:\n\na=1;a=1;\n\na=-1;a=-1;\n\na=-1/4;a=-1/4;\n\na=2.a=2.\n\nExercise 3\n\nGiven vectors x,y,z∈Rnx,y,z∈Rn and the scalar a∈Ra∈R, prove the\nfollowing identities:\n\nFootnotes\n\nIn a formal development of linear algebra, the abstract concept of a\nvector space plays a fundamental role. We will leave such concepts to a\ncomplete course in linear algebra and introduce only the functional techniques\nnecessary to solve the problems at hand.\n\nThe division of two vectors is undefined, although three different \"divisions\" are defined","id":"/389","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9958609342575073,"__label__0":0.004159095697104931}}

{"text":"The Basics of Algebra\n\nBefore you can really get into Algebra 1 and understand what's going on, you have to understand the basics. These basics include a number of topics from arithmetic that will be used extensively in Algebra 1, so it's really important that you know them well. If you take the time to understand these topics before you try to tackle more complicated subjects, then you'll have a strong foundation for the rest of your education in mathematics.\n\nOne of the topics from basic mathematics that people think they understand when they really don't is the order of operations. The order of operations tells us which order we should do things in when we have complicated mathematical equations. We need this standard order of operations so that people don't get different answers for something as simple as 1 * 2 + 3. If you do it correctly, you should get 5, but if you do it incorrectly, you could get 6. If people went around getting different answers for equations, then mathematics wouldn't have much use.\n\nAnother important topic to understand is the use of variables, and this is the basis of a lot of ideas in Algebra 1. A variable is a letter that takes the place of a number that either we don't know or we want to keep open for various numbers to take its place. Sometimes we're going to be solving for a specific variable, like if we have the equation 2x – 3 = 17. Other times we're going to be looking at the nature of an equation with variables in it, like when we look at the graph created from the equation y = 3x + 2.\n\nExponents are another topic that should be understood before jumping into Algebra 1. While they aren't difficult to understand by themselves, doing complicated operations using exponents can be tricky. If you know the few simple rules for dealing with exponents, then they can be made fairly simple.\n\nUnderstanding the distributive property is super important for learning Algebra 1. Without understanding the distributive property, you will find yourself completely lost in a lot of common situations that come up. The distributive property is definitely worth putting a lot of effort into learning.\n\nOrder of Operations – If there are no parentheses to point out what to do first, the order of operations will tell you how to make sure you get the right answer.\n\nThe Integers – Dealing with both positive and negative numbers is an important skill in Algebra 1.\n\nVariables – We don't always know the value of numbers we're dealing with, but variables let us do math with these numbers anyway.\n\nExponents – Just like multiplication is repeated addition, exponents allow us to use a shorthand for repeated multiplication.\n\nPercentages – Having an even ground for comparison between different amounts is a critical skill.","id":"/455","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9973241686820984,"__label__0":0.0026958573143929243}}

They represent the average rate of change on a graph and examine the behavior of the graph for decreasing and increasing numerals.\n\nIn this function instructional activity, students read word problems and write functions. They determine the instantaneous rate of change and identify intervals. This three-page instructional activity contains approximately 20 problems.\n\nHigh schoolers investigate logistic models by making a scatter plot of internet phone users over 5 years. They find a logistic model that fits their data and then discuss what the instantaneous rate of change means in the context of the problem. Very relevant and applicable!\n\nIn this calculus worksheet, students problem solve 8 word problems involving rates of change in association with high school students. Students work out each problem and give a short explanation of each answer.\n\nStudents, with the assistance of their TI-84 Plus / TI-83 Plus calculators, distinguish meanings from right, left and symmetric difference quotients that include rate of change and graphical interpretations. They utilize symmetric difference quotients to approximate instantaneous rate of changes.\n\nFor this calculus worksheet, 12th graders differentiate and integrate basic trigonometric functions, calculate rates of change, and integrate by substitution and by parts. The twenty-two page worksheet contains explanation of the topic, numerous worked examples, and sixteen multi-part practice problems. Answers are not provided.\n\nIn this successive approximations activity, students use the Babylonian algorithm to determine the roots of given numbers. They identify the limits of a function, and compute the rate of change in a linear function. This two-page activity contains explanations, examples, and approximately ten problems.\n\nStudents calculate the rate of change using the derivative. In this algebra lesson plan, students identify the function over closed interval and identify the rate of change. They use correct notation and classify a function as increasing or decreasing.\n\nLearners explore the concept of rate of change.

{"text":"Matrices are very powerful mathematical tools\napplicable in a wide range of real world problems.\nIntuitively, the main advantage in using matrices is that\nthey allow the logical manipulation of very large sets of\nnumbers at once. More rigorously, they allow the manipulation\n(and solution) of linear equation systems which\nin turn reppresent real world problems.\n\nJust as example, the voltages and currents\nin an electronic board with 1000 components can be described\nby a very huge system of linear equations. 1000 components\nimply 1000 unknown voltages and 1000 unknown currents. Attempting\nto find such a large number of unknown variables without a method\nis substantially a suicide. With the use of matrices such a system\ncan be solved in a very elegant way.\n\nToday, matrices are used not simply for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations,\nbut also for describing the quantum mechanics of atomic structure, designing computer\ngame graphics, analyzing relationships, and even plotting complicated dance steps :)\n\nIn this article we try to develop our mathematical tool step by step.\n\nDefinition\n\nA matrix is an ordered, bidimensional collection\nof mathematical expressions usually rapresented as a rectangular table.\n\nThe horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical\nlines are called columns. A matrix with m rows and\nn columns is called an m-by-n matrix (written mxn)\nand m and n are called its dimensions. The dimensions of a matrix\nare always given with the number of rows first, then the number of columns.\n\nIf the number of rows of a matrix equals the number of columns (m = n) then\nthe matrix is said to be square otherwise it's just rectangular.\nSquare matrixes have several interesting properties that we'll talk about later.\n\nThe entry of a matrix A that lies in the i-th row and the j-th column is called\nthe i,j entry or (i,j)-th entry of A. This is written as ai,j,\naij or A[i,j]. The row is always noted first, then the column.\n\nA special matrix with one of the dimensions set to 1 is called vector.\nA 1xn matrix is called row vector\n\nwhile a mx1 matrix is called column vector.\n\nIf the entries of a matrix are all real numbers then the matrix is said\nto be real. If the entries are complex numbers then\nthe matrix is too said to be complex. If the entries\nare polynomials then (guess what?) the matrix is said to be polynomial too.\n\nThe entries of a matrix usually have some associated meaning but for now\nlet's just say they are mathematical expressions (maybe numbers) and\nconcentrate on matrix manipulation.\n\nLet's play with it\n\nWe define the matrix sum as an operation that given\ntwo mxn matrices A,B returns a mxn matrix C with entries that are sums\nof the corresponding entries in A and B. Please note that the sum\nis defined only for matrices of exactly the same dimensions: we say\nthat such matrices are sum-compatible.\n\nFor sum-compatible matrices it's obvious that\n\nand\n\nWe define the scalar multiplication as an operation\nthat given a mxn matrix A and a scalar expression K returns a mxn matrix B\nwith each entry made of the corresponding entry of A multiplied by K.\n\nIt's again obvious that for sum-compatible matrices A,B and any scalar expression k\n\nand for any matrix A and any couple of scalar expressions\nk1, k2\n\nFood for thoughs: Multiplication by scalar is commutative\nif the underlying ring (of expressions) is commutative. This is true when the expressions\nare (real or complex) numbers or polynomials, that is most real-world cases in that matrices\nare applicable. However, the matrix algebra can be applied also to non commutative rings\n(for example quaternions) where the multiplication by scalar must be splitted in two\ndifferent operations: left multiplication and right multiplication.\n\nNot that obvious\n\nWe define the matrix multiplication as an operation\nthat given a mxp matrix A and a pxn matrix B\nreturns a mxn matrix C with element i,j computed\nas the scalar vector product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column\nof B.\n\nNote that the matrix multiplication is well defined only for\ncouples in that the left matrix has the number of columns equal to the\nnumber of rows of the right matrix. We say such two matrices\nto be multiplication-compatible.\n\nFood for thoughs: the multiplication\nof two nxn matrices processes 2 n2\nentries. However there is no known algorithm with computational\ncost of O(n2). Most algorithm\nare O(n3) and the most clever\nimplementations are O(n2.8).\nAn O(n2.376) algorithm has been proposed\nby Coppersmith and Winograd but its implicit factor hidden by the O() notation\nis so big that its implementation is worthwile only if we're going to\nmultiply matrices with n that is out of our current computing possibilities.\n\nIt's very easy to show that (and here comes the non obvious) the matrix\nmultiplication is generally not commutative, that is\n\nexcept for very few special cases. The (square) matrices for that\n\nare said to commute and must satisfy strict rules\non their elements.\n\nThe non commutativity of the matrix multiplication makes\nthe algebraic manipulation to become non trivial and causes\ninfinite headcaches to engineering students.\n\nHowever, we're lucky since the associative and distributive properties\nstill apply and it can be proven that the following equations are all true\n(given that the matrices involved are multiplication-compatible and\nthe underlying ring is commutative).\n\nTranspose\n\nWe define the transpose of a mxn matrix A\nas a nxm matrix B obtained from A by swapping rows with columns.\nThe transpose of a matrix A is often written as AT\nor as A'.\n\nNote that swapping rows with means effectively swapping\nthe order of indices of each element. The element aij\nof the matrix A becomes the element aji of\nthe transpose.\n\nFood for thoughs: This property is interesting in computer\nmatrix processing. To apply an algorithm to the transpose of a matrix instead of the original\none we can simply swap the parameters of all the matrix element access functions...\n\nA matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a symmetric matrix;\nthat is, A is symmetric if AT = A. Note that A must be\nsquare to be symmetric and internally the elements must satisfy the relation\naij = aji.\n\nIt's easy to show that\n\nfor any matrix A, thus the transposition is a self-inverse operation.\n\nAlso for two matrices with the same dimensions\n\nIf the matrices A and B are multiplication-compatible then\n\nNote that the order of multiplication is inverted.\n\nAnd finally taking the transpose of a scalar (1x1 matrix) is a null operation\n\nThe identity\n\nA particular square matrix that commutes with all other\nmatrices of the same size is the identity matrix.\nThe identity matrix has all unit elements on\nits main diagonal.\n\nIt's easy to prove that\n\nand thus the identity matrix is the \"unity\" element of the matrix algebra\nand the multiplication by the identity matrix is an idempotent operation.\n\nObviously the transpose of an identity matrix is still an identity matrix.\n\nThe inverse\n\nGiven a square matrix A we define the inverse matrix of A\nas the matrix that when multiplied by A gives the identity matrix as result.\nThe inverse matrix is usually written as A-1.\n\nThe inverse matrix does not necessairly exist. A matrix that has no inverse\nis said to be non invertible or singular.\n\nNote that A and its inverse (when it exists) do commute.\n\nFood for thoughs: for non square matrices\nwe can define the left (A-1A=I) and the\nright inverse (AA-1)=I. Such inverses\nhave few real world applications...\n\nIt can be shown that the inverse of a matrix is again invertible and that\n\nfor any invertible matrix A and that\n\nfor any invertible matrix A and any non null scalar k.\n\nIt can be also proven that\n\nfor invertible matrices A and B of the same size. Note that the order\nof factors is inverted and the formula is very similar to the one\nthat involves transposition.\n\nFinding the inverse of a matrix is a very common highly intensive computational task.\nThere are several algorithms that implement this operation and many of\nthem operate better on matrices with elements that satisfy certain properties\nor conformations.\n\nThe above system of m linear equations in n unknown variables can be rewritten\nby using matrices as follows\n\nThe rows of the A matrix on the left contain the coefficients\nof the linear equations of the system. The unknown variables and\nthe known terms are collected in row vectors x and b.\n\nSolving the system means finding the set of values x1,x2,...,xn\nthat satisfy all the equations at the same time.\nIn most cases (if the field of the matrix elements is\ninfinite) exactly one of the following statements is true:\n\nthe system is undetermined (the set of solutions is empty)\n\nthe system is overdetermined (the set of solutions contains infinitely many elements)\n\nthe system is exactly determined (the set of solutions contains contain exactly one element)\n\nThe most interesting case is obviously the one with exactly one solution.\nThe Rouche'-Capelli theorem states that for a system of linear equations with\nn unknown variables to be exactly determined there must be at\nleast n linearly independent equations.\nSince more equations are unnecessary then the most interesting\nlinear systems are described by a square coefficient matrix.\n\nBy using trivial manipulations we can now show that by inverting\nthe matrix of coefficients we can solve the system.\nWe multiply boths sides of the system equation by the inverse of A\n\nSince by definition\n\nso the formula above can be rewritten as\n\nand since\n\nthen trivially\n\nThe last formula is very important since it provides the\nreal motivation for studying the inverse matrices. If we're\nable to find the inverse of A, we can solve the system.\n\nDeterminants\n\nThe definition of the matrix determinant is quite scary.\nGiven a square nxn matrix A, it's determinant is defined as\n\nwhere E(n) is the set of permutations\nof the numbers {1,2,....n}, P is a single permutation taken out of that set and sgn(P)\nis a function that returns +1 if the permutation P is\neven\nand -1 if the permutation P is odd.\nP(i), then, is the i-th element of the permutation P.\n\nThe formula above is also known as Liebniz formula.\nand is better explained with an example. Consider the following 2x2 matrix.\n\nIn this case n is 2 and thus E(n) is the set of the possible\npermutations of numbers {1,2}. E(n) obviously contains only\ntwo elements: the trivial \"null\" permutation {1,2} (which is even)\nand the permutation {2,1} (which is odd).\n\nThe Liebniz formula expands then to a sum of two elements\ndictated by the two permutations just described.\nEach element of the sum is a product of n elements\nof the matrix taken from distinct columns. The row of each element\nis choosen by the permutation.\n\nIn the first product we move along the columns (indexed by i)\nfrom left to right and take the first and the second row (null\npermutation). This means a11 and a22.\nSince the permutation used is even, then the sign of this product is positive.\n\nIn the second product we move along the columns\nfrom left to right and take the second and then the first row\n(the odd permutation). This means a21 and a12.\nSince the permutation is odd, then the sign of this product is negative.\n\nThe determinant of the 2x2 matrix is then\n\nThis is rather easy to remember if you note that it's the\nsum of the products of the two diagonals of the 2x2 matrix.\nThe product is positive if the diagonal goes \"up\" from left\nto right while it's negative if the diagonal goes \"down\"\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 3x3 matrices is more complex\nand it contains 6 elements.\n\nIf you look close you can still spot the same pattern.\nThere are positive diagonal lines that go down from left\nto right and negative diagonal lines that go up\nfrom left to right.\n\nThe formula for 4x4 matrices becomes really complex\nand is rarely written explicitly. For larger n values\nthe formula becomes very difficult to use because\nit's hard to enumerate all the permutations of n numbers.\nOther methods for finding the determinant exist\nand later we'll probably spot some of them\nbut now let's look at some of the determinant properties.\n\nIt can be shown that for square matrices A and B, any scalar r\nand the square unit matrix I the following properties are true\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nInvertible matrices and their determinants\n\nSince for an invertible matrix A\n\nthen by property 4 of the previous paragraph\n\nand since\n\nthen\n\nwhich implies that\n\nand that\n\nConversely, it can be shown that a non-zero determinant\nfor matrix A implies that the inverse of A exists.\nThe proof requires the notion of the rank of a matrix\nwhich we haven't covered so I'm going to omit it here.\nHowever, the two deductions lead us to the following theorem:\n\n\"A matrix is singular if and only if its determinant is zero\"\n\nor alternatively\n\n\"A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non zero\"\n\nFood for thoughs:\nAs a rule of thumb, almost all square matrices are invertible. Over\nthe field of real numbers, this can be made precise as follows: the set\nof singular n-by-n matrices, is a null set, i.e., has Lebesgue measure zero.\nIntuitively, this means that if you pick a random square matrix over\nthe reals, the probability that it will be singular is zero.\nIn practice however, one may encounter non-invertible matrices. And in numerical\ncalculations, matrices which are invertible, but close to a non-invertible\nmatrix, can still be problematic; such matrices are said to be ill conditioned.","id":"/570","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9952450394630432,"__label__0":0.0047750226221978664}}

{"text":"MATH 240\n\nUsing a calculator\n\nSolving a system of linear equations on a computer or calculator\nis surprisingly difficult.\nInverting a matrix or performing certain other matrix operations\ncan lead to numerical errors that require a lot of theory to understand.\nOur department has an entire undergraduate course,\nMath 434, Numerical Linear Algebra,\nthat covers numerical techniques in linear algebra.\nWe do not have enough time to discuss numerical algorithms in MATH 240,\nand if you do not know the relevant theory,\nyou must be very cautious and skeptical about the answer\nwhen you just press a button on your calculator.\n\nSolving a system of equations\n\nIf you have been trained to believe that\na calculator will always give you the correct answer,\nyou may be in for a shock\nif you try to solve a system of equations\nby just plugging the coefficients into your calculator and pressing a button.\nEven a system of two equations in two unknowns\ncan present problems for the program used by your calculator.\nHere is one example.\n\nWe will try to solve this system of equations.\n\n416785x + 415872y = 1\n415872x + 414961y = 0\n\nThe coefficients in the problem have six significant digits.\nSince the TI-85 calculator stores more than twice that many\nsignificant digits internally,\nsolving the system would seem to present no problem.\nUsing the equation solver on the TI-85 gives the following \"answer\".\n\nYou can \"check\" the calculator answer by substituting it\nback into the system.\nBe sure to use the values stored in the calculator.\nThen, to the limits of the calculator's accuracy,\neverything checks out,\nand, in fact, both solutions appear to be correct.\n\nTo find the exact solution,\nwe can use elementary row operations on the system of equations.\nThe first goal is to reduce the size of the numbers,\nbut retain integer values.\nHere are the results.\n\nThis is not a problem unique to the TI-85.\nUsing MATLAB on a SUN workstation also gives\nan answer that differs substantially from the correct one.\nThe difficulties are inherent in the problem.\nTo look at this problem from the geometric point of view,\nwe could compute the slope of each line.\nTo 12 decimal point accuracy, we get\n\n416785 ÷ 415872 = -1.00219538704\n415872 ÷ 414961 = -1.00219538704\n\nTo most calculators, the lines appear to be parallel,\nand so there should be no solution at all!\nBecause the angle between the two lines is very small,\na small change in the coefficients caused by roundoff error\ncan make a very large difference in the solution.\nFrom a geometric point of view,\nshifting the two lines just a little bit\ncan make a bit difference in the point of intersection.\n\nInverting a matrix\n\nIn the previous problem,\nwe were able to find an exact inverse for the coefficient matrix.\n\nTo illustrate some of the inherent difficulties\nin doing Gaussian elimination using floating point arithmetic,\nwe will look at the row reduction of a standard \"badly behaved\" matrix.\n\nThe matrix given below is called a Hilbert matrix.\nIt is a well-known example of a matrix that causes problems\nfor numerical algorithms.\nTo help understand the problems,\nwe will do an exact row reduction,\ncompared to a row reduction done using floating point arithmetic.\nTo see how the error in the approximations can be compounded,\nwe will use a highly simplified example,\nin which the floating point arithmetic\nis carried out with accuracy to only three significant digits.\n\nIn the original matrix, labeled (1),\nsome of the decimal entries are already inaccurate.\nIn matrix (3), the three digit computation that produces the\n3rd entry in row 4 is this:\n\n.837×10-1 - (.904)(.830×10-1)\n= .837×10-1 - .750×10-1\n= .870×10-2\n\nComparing this to the correct value of\n1 ÷ 120 = .00833 (to 3 digits)\nshows that it has only one correct digit.\n\nIn matrix (5), the last entry of row 4 is computed as follows:\n\n.837×10-2 - (.690)(.127×10-1)\n= .837×10-2 - .876×10-2\n= .006×10-2\n\nBecause we have to subtract two values that are nearly equal,\nthe answer has even less accuracy.\nThe cumulative errors in reducing just 3 rows\nproduce a value of -.0000600 instead of\n(-1) ÷ 4200 = -.000238 (to 3 digits).\n\nThe method for defining a Hilbert matrix can be extended to larger sizes,\nand the 10 by 10 Hilbert matrix presents substantial problems\nfor even a very sophisticated numerical algorithm.\nYou can experiment on your calculator,\nby inverting the Hilbert matrices of larger and larger sizes.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nYves Nievergelt,\nNumerical Linear Algebra on the HP-28 or How to Lie With Supercalculators,\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly, (1991), 539-544","id":"/901","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9986228942871094,"__label__0":0.0013971326407045126}}

{"text":"Tutorial 1\n\nOnce you have access to an installation of Mathematica, you need to know how to\nuse it.\n\nOpening the Program\n\nIn an on-campus computer lab, go to Start Menu, then Programs, then Wolfram Mathematica. Click\non the icon for Mathematica, named Spikey.\n\nUp will pop an introductory window. On the left hand side of this button is an option to create a new Mathematica notebook or open an old one. The\nnotebook is where all your interactions with the program will take place.\n\nFirst steps with Mathematica\n\nOpen the file. The file should look like a \"Powerpoint\" Presentation. If it does not, go to the Format Menu and click on \"Format > Screen Environment > SlideShow\".\n\nFollow this tutorial step-by-step and discuss the most interesting aspects\nwith your neighbors.\n\nAt the end of the tutorial, you should use the remaining time to explore the power of Mathematica. I suggest looking in the Documentation Center (Help Menu) or at the Wolfram Demonstrations Project. Feel free to explore on your own or with your neighbors. If you are having trouble getting started, here is what I do when I am exploring:\n\nI go to the Documentation Center and type in a command (such as Manipulate)\n\nI do a quick look at the selected examples that are given and see if they are interesting.\n\nIf so, I want to see all the examples. So I select the entire notebook (Ctrl-A or Apple-A) and then open all subgroups (Cell Menu: \"Grouping > Open All Subgroups\").\n\nI play around with the examples, moving sliders, changing variables to see what happens.\n\nIf I see a command I do not know, I will search for it in the Documentation Center\n\nAt the bottom of the file is a \"See Also\" section, which tells you similar commands.\n\nAlso at the bottom are links to more in depth tutorials, which can be useful sometimes.\n\nOther Items of Note!\n\nIn Mathematica, it is important to distinguish between parentheses (), brackets [], and braces {}:\n\nParentheses (): Used to group mathematical expressions, such as (3+4)/(5+7).\n\nBrackets []: Used when calling functions, such as N[Pi].\n\nBraces {}: Used when making lists, such as {i,1,20}.\n\nIf you use the wrong symbols in the wrong places or if you do not have a closing symbol for every opening symbol, Mathematica will\ngive you an error.\n\nMathematica is Case-SenSitive (AA is not the same as aA), so\nbe careful about what you type.\nMany of your initial errors will come about because of one of the two above problems.\n\nIn Mathematica, there are four types of equals: =, :=, ==, and\n===. You need to understand the difference between the first two.\n\nTo define a variable to store it in memory, use =. For example, to define z to be 3, write\nz=3.\n\nYou use == to check for equality. For example, 1-1==0 will\nevaluate to True and 1==0 will evaluate to False.\n\nYou use := to define your own command. (This is advanced.)\n\nYou will likely not use === in this class.\n\nOne of the most important things to do is explore. If you are having trouble with a certain function, use the\n? command to ask for help. Enter ? Table and the output will be a yellow box\nwith a quick synopsis of the command. For more detailed information, click the blue >> at the bottom\nright of this yellow box. This will open the Documentation Center\nwhich gives examples of using the\ncommand in action, available options for this command,\nand anything else you might want to know about the command.\n\nAlgebra and Calculus\n\nMathematica will do everything your calculator can and more.\n\nUse ^ to put something to a power.\n\npi is Pi, e is E and sqrt(-1) is I.\n\nIf you want to see the numerical approximation to a fraction or irrational number, use the function N. For example, to find the decimal represenation of pi, write N[Pi].\n\nUse E^x or Exp[x] to represent the function ex.\n\nTo take the derivative of a function, use D and specify the derivative with respect to which\nvariable. For instance D[x^2 + 3x, x].\n\nTo take the integral of a function, use Integrate and specify the integral with respect to\nwhich variable. For instance Integrate[x^2 + 3x, x].\n\nTo solve for the roots of ax2+bx+c=0 symbolically, use Solve[a x^2 + b x + c == 0, x].\nNotice the double equals sign. (Mathematica is searching for when the expression is True.)\n\nCoefficient[(1 + x)^10, x^3] gives the coefficient of x3 in the expansion\nof (1 + x)10.","id":"/915","metadata":{"file_path":"/Users/newton/Documents/GitHub/Filtering-Techniques/climblab_sample.jsonl","__label__1":0.9957221746444702,"__label__0":0.004297889303416014}}
